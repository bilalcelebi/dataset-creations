Writing and recording Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas O'Connell began working on When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go. in May 2016 with the track Listen Before Go but re-recorded the song two years later in spring 2018. Eilish intended the album to contain material that 's so fun to be in the moment at show to as well as shit that 's crazy and also depressing. She further wished to do everything in this album due to her hatred for genre restrictions.The album was recorded in O'Connell 's small bedroom studio in Highland Park California using production material including Logic Pro Universal Audio Apollo interface and pair of Yamaha HS5 studio monitors with an H8S subwoofer. The pair explained that they chose this recording location rather than professional studio due to the bedroom 's intimate and homely nature as well as the manner in which the bedroom affects vocals while criticizing an external studio 's lack of natural light and high cost of use. Despite the independence of the writing process they were nonetheless subject to deadlines and meetings with Eilish 's label Darkroom/Interscope she later stated that she hated every second of the album 's creation. Audio mixing was handled by Rob Kinelski who had mixed all of Eilish 's work thus far. In an interview with Billboard Kinelski disclosed that O'Connell would send him really nice stems for separate instruments during the process.On March 20 2018 Eilish confirmed that she was working on an album and estimated that it would be released towards the end of the year. In July 2018 during an interview with BBC Radio she announced that the album was expected to be out on March 29 2019. The album was mastered and finished in January 2019. Music and lyrics Eilish 's vocal style on When We All Fall Asleep has frequently been described as soft and whispered by music critics. Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph stated that the singer 's tone can shift from coquettish to threatening playfully ironic to emotionally sincere in breath adding that her close-to-the-mic singing is enhanced by layers of ethereal harmonies without swamping sense of intimacy. It has further been likened to ASMR while some reviewers simply stated that her voice reminded them of the sensation others stated that they experienced tingles listening to Eillish 's vocals with Helen Holmes of Observer citing the singer 's little giggles and intonations and the way her intonation 'falls off at the end of sentences as the reasons.The album is built around O'Connell 's production which frequently incorporates amplified bass minimalist percussion and additional foley and acoustic sounds. While the song structures on the record are traditional in construction made of formal melodies accompanied with keyboard guitar or bass instrumentation it further incorporates harsh industrial influences prompting Jon Caramanica of The New York Times to describe Eilish as the first SoundCloud-rap pop star without the rapping. Chris Willman of Variety also noted the album 's usage of dissonance and distortion commenting that With all its moments of distortion and attitude tempered by sheer loveliness and rude and emotional songs about night terrors and daydreams When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go. feels like rock 'n roll album even if there 's virtually nothing on it that sounds like rock music. Elsewhere critics have highlighted indie electronic pop EDM dance-pop synth-pop trap and jazz influences. The record has been noted for its minimalist and hip hop-inspired production leading to comparisons to Lorde 's debut album Pure Heroine which was largely the aim of the siblings as they found that adding additional musical features often makes song sound way worse .Because Eilish draws on variety of genres Yasmin Cowan of Clash opined that to confine her to any specific brand of music would be doing her craft disservice although other reviewers have characterized When We All Fall Asleep as pop electropop avant-pop and art pop album. Robert Christgau describes it as electro-saturated and Chris Riemenschneider from the Star Tribune calls it jaggedly rhythmic candidly intimate stream-of-consciousness electro-pop while Rolling Stone writer Suzy Exposito finds it full of dressed-down avant-pop with D.I.Y. immediacy and intimacy yet still comparable to the maximalist pop of Eilish 's contemporaries Ariana Grande and Halsey. According to Amanda Petrusich from The New Yorker Eilish 's spare portentous style of electropop recalls the work of Trent Reznor but is imbued with far more friskiness conviviality and youthful nonchalance. In Tom Hull 's opinion the album 's electropop songs have quality of catchiness but feature unobtrusive hooks.Lyrically the album deals with the hopes and fears of contemporary youth touching on themes of drug addiction heartbreak climate change mental health and suicide. In an interview with Zane Lowe Eilish explained that the album was largely inspired by lucid dreaming and night terrors revealing that it is basically what happens when you fall asleep hence its title and stated at an earlier interview that it is basically supposed to be bad dream or good dream. i-D writer Jack Hall noted that in order to deal with the record 's serious subject matter in less portentous manner Eilish writes with humor and horror in manner similar to memes. Despite this it is unclear whether the experiences found in the lyrics are her own since she often distances herself from the content of her songs. The singer explained to Rolling Stone that she and her brother like writing from other people 's perspectives elaborating that half of the songs on the album are fictional and half are things she was going through and no one will ever know which is which. In 2021 Eilish stated that the album was almost all fictional. Songs The album 's opening track. is short intro in which Eilish slurps saliva from her Invisalign aligners and announces that this is the album before she and her brother descend into laughter. O'Connell explained that it served to find sense of humor amidst the heaviness of the album. The following track Bad Guy is pop-trap song which uses bass kick-drum and amplified finger snaps in its production. The song 's lyrics feature Eilish taunting her partner while suggesting that she is the bad guy rather than him. Eilish was inspired to write Xanny after attending party at which her friends kept throwing up kept drinking more consequently becoming completely not who they were. While recording the song Eilish and her brother created sound inspired by girl blowing cigarette smoke in the former 's face alongside drum kit and jazz-inspired loop in order to replicate the feeling of being in secondhand smoke. You Should See Me in Crown which the two siblings wrote after watching the third episode of the second season of BBC television series Sherlock titled The Reichenbach Fall is trap-influenced electropop song which features Eilish singing over blaring synths and rapid-fire hi-hats. All the Good Girls Go to Hell was described by Stereogum as punchy piano number and one of the album 's poppiest tracks and explores the idea that God and the Devil are both looking at human beings as this kind of meek group of people and just being like What are they trying to do here. The following track Wish You Were Gay is jazzy classic pop song where Eilish sings of her wish that man she likes was gay in order to explain his lack of romantic interest in her. The seventh song on the album When the Party 's Over is piano ballad with choral influences and was written after O'Connell had left his date 's house kind of for no reason. The eighth track titled is ukulele-based lullaby which manipulates Eilish 's vocals to make her sound like small child. The following song My Strange Addiction is bass-heavy pop song which samples audio from an episode of the American television sitcom The Office titled Threat Level Midnight. In order to include the samples Eilish needed the approval of Steve Carell B. J. Novak John Krasinski and Mindy Kaling the members of the episode 's cast featured in the audio which they all personally granted. The next track Bury Friend has been described as minimalist electronica and industrial song and musically features beat reminiscent of Black Skinhead by Kanye West vocal line similar to People Are Strange by the Doors and scattered synth melodies. It is written from the perspective of monster under bed exploring what this creature is doing or feeling with lyrics from which the album title originates. The song 's beat segues into the eleventh track Ilomilo an electropop cut named after the 2010 video game in order to give the album further cohesion.The final three tracks have titles that form sentence Listen Before Go Love You Goodbye. In an interview with Vulture O'Connell stated that his sister liked the readability of that before adding that they are related since they are different sentiments about farewell. The three songs are placed at the end of the album so as to avoid an abrupt ending to the album. Listen Before Go is an ambient song that features gentle piano accompaniment and jazz influences while Eilish sings from the perspective of someone about to commit suicide with faint street noises and sirens added at the beginning and end of the track for ambience. The following track Love You is similar in aesthetic and uses sample of an airline attendant talking and plane taking off. O'Connell has described the song as being about how it sucks to be in love sometimes while its chorus has drawn comparisons to Leonard Cohen 's Hallelujah which have pleased the songwriter. The final song Goodbye features line of each of the album 's tracks with the exception of. in its lyrics in reverse order compared with how they appear in the album beginning with line from Love You and ending with line from Bad Guy with clips from these songs layered quietly in reverse as motif representing when you grow up listening to tape and at the end you reverse the tape to go back to the beginning of the song. Artwork and packaging The cover artwork for When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go. was photographed by Kenneth Cappello with whom Eilish had previously collaborated for the artwork of her 2017 EP Do n't Smile at Me. After working with the singer on pictures for her. magazine Cappello was asked to photograph the artwork for her upcoming album. The shoot took place on Eilish 's birthday in December at studio in Los Angeles and lasted 12 hours. The singer had prepared sketches for the album cover which were inspired by the album 's themes of night terrors and lucid dreaming as well as Eilish 's interest in horror films specifically The Babadook. Cappello told MTV News that he knew she wanted it moody. In order for it to feel real Cappello added no additional lighting to the end photo so as to give the impression that door was opening and that was the light coming into the bedroom. He additionally shot different variations of Eilish sitting on the bed expressing range of emotions. Eilish wore contacts to fill in her eyes completely with white. She further wished to use minimum of additional special effects and touch-ups on the end product to retain sense of realness and transparency.

Album,An album is collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc CD vinyl audio tape or another medium such as digital distribution. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records collected in bound book resembling photograph album this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing LP records played at 33+1⁄3 rpm. The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the cassette tape during the 1970s and early 1980s the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s. Most albums are recorded in studio although they may also be recorded in concert venue at home in the field or mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately and then brought or mixed together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed live even when done in studio. Studios are built to absorb sound eliminating reverberation to assist in mixing different takes other locations such as concert venues and some live rooms have reverberation which creates live sound. Recordings including live may contain editing sound effects voice adjustments etc. With modern recording technology artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones with each part recorded as separate track. Album covers and liner notes are used and sometimes additional information is provided such as analysis of the recording and lyrics or librettos. Historically the term album was applied to collection of various items housed in book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later collections of related 78 rpm records were bundled in book-like albums one side of 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound. When LP records were introduced collection of pieces or songs on single record was called an album the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc MiniDisc compact audio cassette 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.,An album is collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc CD vinyl audio tape or another medium such as digital distribution.

History An album Latin albus white in ancient Rome was board chalked or painted white on which decrees edicts and other public notices were inscribed in black. It was from this that in medieval and modern times album came to denote book of blank pages in which verses autographs sketches photographs and the like are collected. This in turn led to the modern meaning of an album as collection of audio recordings issued as single item. In the early nineteenth century album was occasionally used in the titles of some classical music sets such as Robert Schumann 's Album for the Young Opus 68 set of 43 short pieces.With the advent of 78 rpm records in the early 1900s the typical 10-inch disc could only hold about three minutes of sound per side so almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. Classical-music and spoken-word items generally were released on the longer 12-inch 78s playing around 4–5 minutes per side. For example in 1924 George Gershwin recorded drastically shortened version of his new seventeen-minute composition Rhapsody in Blue with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. The recording was issued on both sides of single record Victor 55225 and ran for 8m 59s. By 1910 though some European record companies had issued albums of complete operas and other works the practice of issuing albums was not widely taken up by American record companies until the 1920s. By about 1910 bound collections of empty sleeves with paperboard or leather cover similar to photograph album were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records the term record album was printed on some covers. These albums came in both 10-inch and 12-inch sizes. The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside allowing the record album to be placed on shelf upright like book suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them. In the 1930s record companies began issuing collections of 78 rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover. Most albums included three or four records with two sides each making six or eight compositions per album.The 10-inch and 12-inch LP record long play or 33+1⁄3 rpm microgroove vinyl record is gramophone record format introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. single LP record often had the same or similar number of tunes as typical album of 78s and it was adopted by the record industry as standard format for the album. Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. The term album was extended to other recording media such as 8-track tape audio cassette compact disc MiniDisc and digital albums as they were introduced. As part of trend of shifting sales in the music industry some observers feel that the early 21st century experienced the death of the album. Length An album may contain any number of tracks. In the United States The Recording Academy 's rules for Grammy Awards state that an album must comprise minimum total playing time of 15 minutes with at least five distinct tracks or minimum total playing time of 30 minutes with no minimum track requirement. In the United Kingdom the criteria for the UK Albums Chart is that recording counts as an album if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than 25 minutes. Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as mini-albums or EPs. Albums such as Tubular Bells Amarok and Hergest Ridge by Mike Oldfield and Yes Close to the Edge include fewer than four tracks but still surpass the 25-minute mark. The album Dopesmoker by Sleep contains only single track but the composition is over 63 minutes long. There are no formal rules against artists such as Pinhead Gunpowder referring to their own releases under thirty minutes as albums. If an album becomes too long to fit onto single vinyl record or CD it may be released as double album where two vinyl LPs or compact discs are packaged together in single case or triple album containing three LPs or compact discs. Recording artists who have an extensive back catalogue may re-release several CDs in one single box with unified design often containing one or more albums in this scenario these releases can sometimes be referred to as two or three -fer or compilation of previously unreleased recordings. These are known as box sets. Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once in the form of boxed sets although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album. Tracks Material music or sounds is stored on an album in sections termed tracks normally 12 tracks. music track often simply referred to as track is an individual song or instrumental recording. The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles. When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side. On compact disc the track number is indexed so that player can jump straight to the start of any track. On digital music stores such as iTunes the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content. track that has the same name as the album is called the title track. Bonus tracks bonus track also known as bonus cut or bonus is piece of music which has been included as an extra. This may be done as marketing promotion or for other reasons. It is not uncommon to include singles B-sides live recordings and demo recordings as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums where those tracks were n't originally included. Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves bonus tracks may be included if customer buys whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist. The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as stand-alone download adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album. In contrast to hidden tracks bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have gap of silence between other album tracks. Bonus tracks on CD or vinyl albums are common in Japan for releases by European and North American artists since importing international copies of the album can be cheaper than buying domestically released version Japanese releases often feature bonus tracks to incentivize domestic purchase. Audio formats Non-audio printed format Commercial sheet music are published in conjunction with the release of new album studio compilation soundtrack etc. matching folio songbook is compilation of the music notation of all the songs included in that particular album. It typically has the album 's artwork on its cover and in addition to sheet music it includes photos of the artist. Most pop and rock releases come in standard Piano/Vocal/Guitar notation format and occasionally Easy Piano E-Z Play Today. Rock-oriented releases may also come in Guitar Recorded Versions edition which are note-for-note transcriptions written directly from artist recordings. Vinyl records Vinyl LP records have two sides each comprising one-half of the album. If pop or rock album contained tracks released separately as commercial singles they were conventionally placed in particular positions on the album. During the Sixties particularly in the UK singles were generally released separately from albums. Today many commercial albums of music tracks feature one or more singles which are released separately to radio TV or the Internet as way of promoting the album. Albums have been issued that are compilations of older tracks not originally released together such as singles not originally found on albums b-sides of singles or unfinished demo recordings.Double albums during the Seventies were sometimes sequenced for record changers. In the case of two-record set for example sides and would be stamped on one record and sides and on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an automatic record changer with side on the bottom and side on the other record on top. Side would automatically drop onto the turntable and be played. When finished the tone arm 's position would trigger mechanism which moved the arm out of the way dropped the record with side and played it. When both records had been played the user would pick up the stack turn it over and put them back on the spindle—sides and would then play in sequence. Record changers were used for many years of the LP era but eventually fell out of use. 8-track tape 8-track tape formally Stereo commonly known as the eight-track cartridge eight-track tape or simply eight-track is magnetic tape sound recording technology popular in the United States from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s when the Compact Cassette format took over. The format is regarded as an obsolete technology and was relatively unknown outside the United States the United Kingdom Canada and Australia.Stereo was created in 1964 by consortium led by Bill Lear of Lear Jet Corporation along with Ampex Ford Motor Company General Motors Motorola and RCA Victor Records RCA. It was further development of the similar Stereo-Pak four-track cartridge created by Earl Madman Muntz. later quadraphonic version of the format was announced by RCA in April 1970 and first known as Quad-8 then later changed to just Q8. Compact cassette The Compact Cassette was popular medium for distributing pre-recorded music from the early 1970s to the early 2000s. The first Compact Cassette was introduced by Philips in August 1963 in the form of prototype. Compact Cassettes became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony Walkman which allowed the person to control what they listened to. The Walkman was convenient because of its size the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with clip for belts or pants.The compact cassette used double-sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale. The music is recorded on both the and side of the tape with cassette being turned to play the other side of the album. Compact Cassettes were also popular way for musicians to record Demos or Demo Tapes of their music to distribute to various record labels in the hopes of acquiring recording contract.Compact cassettes also saw the creation of mixtapes which are tapes containing compilation of songs created by any average listener of music. The songs on mixtape generally relate to one another in some way whether it be conceptual theme or an overall sound. After the introduction of Compact discs the term Mixtape began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format.The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the 1990s after the release and distribution Compact Discs. The 2010s saw revival of Compact Cassettes by independent record labels and DIY musicians who preferred the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet. Compact disc The compact disc format replaced both the vinyl record and the cassette as the standard for the commercial mass-market distribution of physical music albums. After the introduction of music downloading and MP3 players such as the iPod US album sales dropped 54.6 from 2001 to 2009. The CD is digital data storage device which permits digital recording technology to be used to record and play-back the recorded music. MP3 albums and similar Most recently the MP3 audio format has matured revolutionizing the concept of digital storage. Early MP3 albums were essentially CD-rips created by early CD-ripping software and sometimes real-time rips from cassettes and vinyl. The so-called MP3 album is not necessarily just in MP3 file format in which higher quality formats such as FLAC and WAV can be used on storage media that MP3 albums reside on such as CD-R-ROMs hard drives flash memory e.g. thumbdrives MP3 players SD cards etc. Types of album The contents of the album are usually recorded in studio or live in concert though may be recorded in other locations such as at home as with JJ Cale 's Okie Beck 's Odelay David Gray 's White Ladder and others in the field as with early Blues recordings in prison or with mobile recording unit such as the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Studio Most albums are studio albums that is they are recorded in recording studio with equipment meant to give those overseeing the recording as much control as possible over the sound of the album. They minimize external noises and reverberations and have highly sensitive microphones and sound mixing equipment. In some studios each member of band records their part in separate rooms or even at separate times while listening to the other parts of the track with headphones to keep the timing right. In the 2000s with the advent of digital recording it became possible for musicians to record their part of song in another studio in another part of the world and send their contribution over digital channels to be included in the final product. Live Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing or multi-tracking are termed live even when done in studio. However the common understanding of live album is one that was recorded at concert with public audience even when the recording is overdubbed or multi-tracked. Concert or stage performances are recorded using remote recording techniques. Albums may be recorded at single concert or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause laughter and other noise from the audience monologues by the performers between pieces improvisation and so on. They may use multitrack recording direct from the stage sound system rather than microphones placed among the audience and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording. Notable early live albums include the double album of Benny Goodman The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert released in 1950. Live double albums later became popular during the 1970s. Appraising the concept in Christgau 's Record Guide Rock Albums of the Seventies 1981 Robert Christgau said most are profit-taking recaps marred by sound and format inappropriate to phonographic reproduction you ca n't put sights smells or fellowship on audio tape. But for Joe Cocker and Bette Midler and Bob-Dylan-in-the-arena the form makes compelling kind of sense. Eric Clapton 's Unplugged 1992 over 26 million copies Garth Brooks Double Live 1998 over 21 million copies and Peter Frampton 's Frampton Comes Alive. 1976 over 11 million copies are among the best selling live albums. In Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 18 albums were live albums. Solo solo album in popular music is an album recorded by current or former member of musical group which is released under that artist 's name only even though some or all other band members may be involved. The solo album appeared as early as the late 1940s. 1947 Billboard magazine article heralded Margaret Whiting huddling with Capitol execs over her first solo album on which she will be backed by Frank De Vol. There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation band member can solicit from other members of their band and still have the album referred to as solo album. One reviewer wrote that Ringo Starr 's third venture Ringo echnically ... was n't solo album because all four Beatles appeared on it. Three of the four members of the Beatles released solo albums while the group was officially still together. performer may record solo album for several reasons. solo performer working with other members will typically have full creative control of the band be able to hire and fire accompanists and get the majority of the proceeds. The performer may be able to produce songs that differ widely from the sound of the band with which the performer has been associated or that the group as whole chose not to include in its own albums. Graham Nash of The Hollies described his experience in developing solo album as follows The thing that go through that results in solo album is an interesting process of collecting songs that ca n't be done for whatever reason by lot of people. solo album may also represent the departure of the performer from the group. Compilation album compilation album is collection of material from various recording projects or various artists assembled with theme such as the greatest hits from one artist B-sides and rarities by one artist or selections from record label musical genre certain time period or regional music scene. Promotional sampler albums are compilations. ==== Tribute or cover ==== tribute or cover album is compilation of cover versions of songs or instrumental compositions.

History Early success 1970–1973 While their fathers were stationed at the United States Air Force base at RAF South Ruislip near London in the mid-1960s Beckley Bunnell and Peek attended London Central High School at Bushey Hall where they met while playing in two different bands. Peek left for the United States for failed attempt at college during 1969. Soon after his return to the UK the following year the three began making music together. Starting out with borrowed acoustic guitars they developed style that incorporated three-part vocal harmony with the style of contemporary folk-rock acts such as Crosby Stills Nash. Eventually the trio dubbed itself America inspired by the Americana jukebox in their local mess hall and chose it because they did not want anyone to think they were British musicians trying to sound American. They played their first gigs in the London area including some highlights at the Roundhouse in London 's Chalk Farm district. They were eventually taken on by producer Ian Samwell best known for writing Cliff Richard 's 1958 breakthrough hit Move It and his partner Jeff Dexter and through their efforts they were eventually contracted to Kinney Records UK in March 1971 by Ian Ralfini and assigned to the UK Warner Bros. label. Their first album America 1971 was recorded at Trident Studios in London and produced by Samwell and Dexter who became the trio 's manager. Dexter also gave the band their first major gig 20 December 1970 at Implosion at the Roundhouse Chalk Farm as the opening act for The Who Elton John Patto and the Chalk Farm Salvation Army Band and Choir for Christmas charity event. Although the trio initially planned to record the album in similar manner to The Beatles Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band Samwell convinced them to perfect their acoustic style instead. The debut album America was released in late December 1971 to only moderate success although it sold well in the Netherlands where Dexter had taken them as training ground to practice their craft. Samwell and Dexter subsequently brought the trio to Morgan Studios to record several additional songs. One of them was Bunnell composition called Desert Song which Dexter previously demonstrated during studio rehearsals in Puddletown Dorset at the home of Arthur Brown. The song had its public debut at the Harrogate Festival four days later to great audience response. After several performances and TV show it was retitled Horse with No Name. The song became major worldwide hit in early 1972. It sold over one million copies and was awarded gold disc by the RIAA in March 1972. America 's debut album was released in the U.S. that same month with the hit song added and quickly went platinum. The album resulted in second major chart success with Beckley 's Need You which peaked at number on the US charts.After their initial success the trio played series of North American club and college dates in early 1972 and decided to dismiss Samwell and Dexter and relocate to Los Angeles California signing with the David Geffen/Elliot Roberts stable at Lookout Management. By 1973 the band had left Lookout to go with John Hartmann and Harlan Goodman after the latter two had broken away from Geffen/Roberts to set up their own management firm.The recording of second album was delayed by the relocation as well as by an injury to Peek 's arm. Deciding not to replace Samwell the group opted to produce the album themselves. The trio began their move away from mainly acoustic style to more rock music-oriented style with the help of Hal Blaine on drums and Joe Osborn on bass. With Peek playing lead electric guitar on more tracks the group expanded from an acoustic trio to embrace fuller live sound adding Dave Atwood who had played as session musician on their debut album on drums and David Dickey formerly of the group Captain on bass in late 1972. But their next tour was delayed until January 1973 after Peek fell ill with hepatitis. On 11 March 1973 Atwood had been replaced by Dickey 's former Captain bandmate Willie Leacox. America 's second album Homecoming was released in November 1972. Awarded gold disc in December 1972 the album 's million sales figure was confirmed by the RIAA in 1975. The group reached the top 10 again with Bunnell 's Ventura Highway. Based on their first two albums the group won Grammy Award for Best New Artist of 1972. The group 's output grew increasingly ambitious. Their third offering Hat Trick was released in October 1973 following several months of recording at the Record Plant Studios in Los Angeles. Again self-produced the album featured strings harmonicas an eight-minute title track and tap dancing. Beckley Bunnell and Peek were once again joined by Blaine on drums while Osborn was replaced by their touring bassist David Dickey. The album was not as successful as Homecoming featuring only one modestly successful single Muskrat Love number 67 in the US penned by Texas folk singer Willis Alan Ramsey. Captain Tennille cover of the song reached the top 10 in late 1976. George Martin years 1974–1979 After the disappointing commercial performance of Hat Trick America chose to enlist an outside producer for their next album. They were able to secure the services of producer George Martin and recording engineer Geoff Emerick who played major role in shaping the sound of the Beatles. Sessions took place at AIR Studios in London. The resulting album Holiday was released in June 1974 by this time the group had consciously begun naming their albums with titles starting with the letter. With Martin 's guidance the album 's style was very different from America 's first three efforts as he enhanced America 's acoustic sound with strings and brass. During an early 1975 tour of Europe bassist Calvin Fuzzy Samuels formerly of Crosby Stills Nash Young and Manassas was called to fill in for Dickey who was not available. Samuels also appeared live with the group on the German TV program Musikladen. The trio soon found themselves in the top 10 once again with the first single from Holiday the Bunnell-penned Tin Man which reached number four featuring cryptic lyrics set to Wizard of Oz theme. Lonely People written by Dan Peek followed Tin Man into the top 10 in early 1975 becoming Dan Peek 's only credited song to reach that high on Billboard peaking at number five.Martin worked with the trio again for their next LP Hearts recorded in Sausalito California and released in March 1975. America scored its second chart-topping success with Beckley 's Sister Golden Hair in mid-1975 song that featured memorable opening guitar riff admittedly inspired by George Harrison 's My Sweet Lord and frank relationship lyrics inspired by Jackson Browne. The follow-up single Beckley 's ballad Daisy Jane also scored among the top 20 shortly after. Peek 's reggae-influenced Woman Tonight was third success No. 44 in the US from the album towards the end of the year.Warner Bros. released compilation of America 's best-known tracks in December 1975 History America 's Greatest Hits which went platinum. Martin who produced the album remixed those tracks which were culled from the group 's first three albums.During early 1976 the group recorded its sixth studio album at Caribou Ranch near Nederland Colorado inspiring the album 's title Hideaway which Martin produced. Released in April 1976 the album 's two singles Today 's the Day and Amber Cascades managed to reach Nos. 23 and 75 respectively on the Billboard pop chart. The two singles hit number one and 17 respectively on the Billboard adult contemporary chart. Songs such as Jet Boy Blue and Do n't Let It Get You Down were programmed on FM stations. Martin 's implementation of more complex instrumentation on America 's albums proved somewhat overwhelming to the band on stage often compelling them to switch from instrument to instrument during songs. For their 1976 tour the group expanded their stage line-up to include Jim Calire on keyboards and sax and Tom Walsh on percussion so they could more comfortably perform Martin 's arrangements.Martin and the trio went to Hawaii during late 1976 to work on the group 's seventh studio album which was recorded in beach house on the island of Kauai. The album Harbor released in February 1977 continued the trend of decreasing sales for the group. It was their first album to fail to score either platinum or gold and none of its three singles charted. In May 1977 Dan Peek left the band. In his 2004 autobiography An American Band Peek states that he was voted out after missing tour rehearsal but Bunnell later denied this was the case saying that the decision to leave had been Peek 's after he recently had renewed his Christian faith following years of recreational drug use and had begun to seek different artistic direction from Beckley or Bunnell. Nevertheless Peek goes on to say in his book that he takes full blame for the group 's fracturing. Peek contracted with Pat Boone 's Lamb Lion Records and issued his first solo album All Things Are Possible in 1978. The album produced by Chris Christian was successful and Peek became pioneering artist in the emerging Christian popular music genre. The title track entered the Billboard pop charts in early 1979 peaking at No. 78.Meanwhile Beckley and Bunnell decided to continue as America ending their contract with Warner Bros. with the release of their first concert LP Live during October 1977. Recorded at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles the performance featured backing orchestra conducted by Elmer Bernstein. The concert was recorded shortly after Peek left the group. The album was only mildly successful on the popular charts whereas all of their previous albums even Harbor had at least made the top 30 Live just barely made it onto the album chart peaking at No. 129. Capitol years 1979–1985 After more than two years without new studio material Beckley and Bunnell presented the group 's new style with cover of The Mamas the Papas California Dreamin in March 1979. It was featured on the soundtrack for the 1979 movie California Dreaming. Although the movie was unsuccessful and the soundtrack was issued by an obscure distributor known as American International the single reached number 56 on the charts. America 's first studio album without Peek Silent Letter was released in June 1979 on their new label Capitol Records. The album once again produced by George Martin was recorded in Montserrat in the West Indies with the members of the live band David Dickey Willie Leacox Michael Woods their former roadie who joined their touring band in late 1977 on lead guitar Jim Calire and Tom Walsh. The group began to use songs from other songwriters as they sought to increase their commercial success. The album scored no higher than number 110 on the charts leading Bunnell sarcastically to dub the album Silent Record. During the latter part of 1979 Calire and Walsh were dropped from the on-stage line-up. Session bassist Bryan Garafalo replaced Dickey in 1980 and Bradley Palmer took over from Garafalo in 1981. America continued to evolve as the 1980s began. For their next album Alibi released in August 1980 Beckley and Bunnell sought fresh personnel in the form of producers Matthew McCauley and Fred Mollin. They also employed players from the West Coast such as the Eagles Timothy B. Schmit Leland Sklar and Steve Lukather to help improve their sound. Alibi eschewed the strings and brass of typical George Martin project in favour of more popular-rock style. It also became the third studio album in row without successful single in the United States although Beckley 's Survival scored the top of the charts in Italy. The album 's sales peaked at number 142. America 's next album View from the Ground released in July 1982 had the group finally score another commercial success. The album recorded under the working title Two Car Garage featured number of songs produced by the duo themselves. As with Alibi 1980 Beckley and Bunnell brought in number of high-profile musicians including the Beach Boys Carl Wilson Toto 's Jeff Porcaro Christopher Cross and Dean Parks. Former Argent guitarist Russ Ballard though had the greatest effect on the group 's fortunes. Ballard produced and played all of the instruments and sang most of the background vocals on song he crafted especially for the band called You Can Do Magic. The song rose quickly through the pop charts and scored as high as number eight on the Billboard pop-singles chart for number of weeks during October 1982 the band 's first major success in seven years. Following Magic was the single Right Before Your Eyes. Written by Ian Thomas brother of comedian Dave Thomas of Strange Brew fame and produced by Bobby Colomby the single barely missed spot in the top 40 during early 1983. Although View from the Ground failed to achieve gold-rated sales it scored as high as number 41 on the album charts significant improvement over the previous few releases. Having had success with Ballard Beckley and Bunnell asked the former Argent performer to produce their next album Your Move in its entirety. In the end Ballard wrote most of the songs and performed most of the instruments in addition to his production duties. For the most part Beckley and Bunnell were singers on an album that Ballard had crafted for them although they did contribute some of their own material. On one track Bunnell decided to rewrite Ballard 's lyrics and the successful song The Border was the result. Set to the backing of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the saxophone work of Raphael Ravenscroft the single scored number 33 on the charts in August 1983. The Border was much more successful on the adult contemporary charts where it scored number four even bettering You Can Do Magic. It also made number 24 on the Dutch top 40. second single Ballard 's Cast the Spirit failed to chart. The album itself released in June 1983 was reasonably successful at number 81 but something of disappointment when compared to its predecessor. America 's work was also featured on several soundtracks during this period. Beckley and Bunnell provided vocals to several Jimmy Webb compositions for the film The Last Unicorn in 1982. The soundtrack became popular in Germany and the group frequently plays its title track when touring in that country. America also recorded Love Comes Without Warning for the 1984 Steve Martin comedy The Lonely Guy. Dan Peek emerged from several years of musical obscurity during May 1984 releasing his second solo Christian album Doer of the Word on Home Sweet Home Records. Once again produced by Chris Christian the album 's title track featured Beckley on backing vocals. Peek issued two more solo albums over the next few years Electro Voice 1986 and Crossover 1987. Meanwhile America opted for decidedly different style from their previous offerings for their 12th studio album Perspective released in September 1984. Ballard was out and synthesizers and drum machines were in. Several different producers including Richie Zito Matthew McCauley who had already produced the aforementioned track Love Comes Without Warning that appeared earlier that year in the film The Lonely Guy and Richard James Burgess helped create an electronic popular style that was very common during the 1980s but drastically different from America 's usual style. Special Girl the album 's first single was culled from hired songwriters and failed to make the charts. The next single Ca n't Fall Asleep to Lullaby was co-written by Bunnell Journey 's Steve Perry Robert Haimer and Bill Mumy the latter of Lost in Space and Babylon fame. Although neither track was played on popular radio both did achieve minor success on the adult contemporary charts. The album peaked at number 185 during three-week stint on the charts in October 1984. Their mainstream commercial success over Beckley and Bunnell ended their Capitol contract with In Concert released in July 1985. The album was recorded at the Arlington Theater in Santa Barbara California on June 1985. In Concert became the first America album to miss the charts entirely. Return to basics 1985–1998 Beckley and Bunnell spent the latter half of the 1980s focusing on their live show performing well over 100 times year around the world. While America remained hot ticket on the touring circuit they were unable to land recording contract in the years after they left the Capitol label. By the early 1990s the development of compact discs led to the reissuing of many older popular albums providing acts such as America with revived sales. During 1991 America was able to offer four new tracks as part of collection issued by Rhino Records called Encore More Greatest Hits which was designed to complement the group 's original 1975 retrospective. America 's resurgence caught the eye of Chip Davis of American Gramaphone Records who signed the group to his label. In May 1994 America released its first new studio album in decade Hourglass. Produced primarily by Beckley and Bunnell with help from Hank Linderman and Steve Levine the album featured an eclectic group of songs. Despite garnering generally positive reviews the album was commercial failure. During 1995 Beckley delivered his debut solo album. Entitled Van Go Gan the album experimented with various styles and sounds. Comedian Phil Hartman who during his career as graphic artist had designed several America album covers was featured as the voice of televangelist preacher on Playing God. Although it was named as one of the top-10 music CDs of the year in Japan in 1995 the album was not released outside Japan until four years later.America fans were also treated to concert album in 1995. Released by the King Biscuit Flower Hour Records Inc. the concert was actually taken from 1982 instalment of the King Biscuit Flower Hour radio show. Known as In Concert not to be confused with the 1985 Capitol release of the same name King Biscuit experienced modest success with the album though America themselves did not it failed to break the charts. This success resulted in new record deal with King Biscuit 's subsidiary label Oxygen Records. After rumours that Steely Dan producer Gary Katz would produce the project came and went the album eventually reached stores in September 1998. The new album entitled Human Nature after the name of Beckley 's home recording studio was accompanied by modest commercial blitz. The first single Beckley 's From Moving Train featured strongly acoustic style. The track received considerable airplay and moderate success in adult contemporary formats. Reports claimed that the song was major success in the popular charts in Spain. second attempt at single in Wednesday Morning was somewhat less successful. The album failed to garner the sales that Oxygen was expecting and America was once again without record deal. New millennium 1999–2006 The next few years had the group 's catalogue expand with number of side projects reissues of older albums on CD and several major retrospective releases. In July 2000 Rhino released Highway 30 Years of America three-CD box set which included 64 remastered tracks spanning the group 's career. Included were handful of alternative mixes and demos such as an early take of stripped-down Ventura Highway. year later in August 2001 Rhino released trimmed-down single disc compilation The Complete Greatest Hits which assembled all of the group 's 17 charting Billboard singles. The disc also included two newly recorded songs World of Light and Paradise. Peaking at number 152 on the Billboard album charts in October 2001 The Complete Greatest Hits was America 's first charting album since Perspective in 1984. On the solo front in February 2000 Beckley released Go Man Go an album of remixed tracks from Van Go Gan. The original Van Go Gan finally had domestic release that July with bonus tracks. June was the roll-out of another Beckley side project Like Brother recorded with Robert Lamm and Carl Wilson under the name Beckley-Lamm-Wilson. Dan Peek resurfaced in 1999 with new website and his first solo release in many years Bodden Town. As part of contemporary trend of recycling oldies recordings to create new hits Janet Jackson 's 2001 single Someone to Call My Lover sampled the Ventura Highway guitar riff and rose to number three on the Billboard pop charts. In October 2002 the group released its first Christmas album Holiday Harmony. Produced by Andrew Gold the album received positive reviews for its imaginative blending of elements of classic America tunes into familiar holiday standards. Included were three new tracks including Bunnell-penned ode to Ventura Highway called Christmas in California featuring Beckley on lead vocals. One month later America released live album The Grand Cayman Concert. Recorded the previous April in the Cayman Islands the concert featured just Beckley and Bunnell on acoustic guitars throwback to the earliest days of their career. Included were their most familiar songs along with few that were almost never performed live such as Wind Wave and Pigeon Song. Both albums failed to chart. After this the band ceased recording and concentrated on their consistently lucrative touring schedule. In early 2003 Bradley Palmer left the touring band after 22 years and was replaced first by Chas Frichtell then by Trent Stroh until Richard Campbell formerly toured with Three Dog Night Natalie Cole and Dave Mason came in permanently. Record labels occasionally offered new DVDs such as re-release of America 's 1979 concert film Live in Central Park 2004 concert at the Sydney Opera House and 2005 show at the Ventura Concert Theater joined with Stephen Bishop and Andrew Gold directed by Sheldon Osmond. Also in 2005 America appeared on the PBS concert series Soundstage with long-time friend Christopher Cross and guest appearance by rock photographer Henry Diltz on banjo. In April 2006 after few solo concerts Beckley released his third solo album Horizontal Fall which was largely ignored by both critics and buyers. His 2011 follow-up Unfortunate Casino met similar fate. Recent activity 2006–present As the second half of the first decade of the 2000s began the group remained very much active and popular in the nostalgia concert circuit. Though the group had occasionally issued new material on minor labels their offerings had been largely ignored by the greater commercial music industry and record-buying public. However fateful connection provided sudden and unexpected change in fortune for the group. Around 2005 Beckley began correspondence with Adam Schlesinger of the independent rock music group Fountains of Wayne. Beckley had been fan of the 2003 Fountains of Wayne album Welcome Interstate Managers and Schlesinger turned out to be fan of America 's work. The exchange of songs between the two resulted in them recording few tracks together. The recordings came to the attention of SonyBMG 's new Burgundy Records label which was impressed both by the quality of the material and by the possibility of pairing America with other independent artists. The company contracted America to record new album with Schlesinger and his musical partner James Iha formerly of The Smashing Pumpkins at the production helm. Entitled Here Now 2007 it would be America 's first major-label studio album since Perspective in 1984. The recording sessions at Stratosphere Sound in New York City which ran through July included guest musicians such as Ryan Adams Ben Kweller Stephen Bishop Rusty Young and members of the groups Nada Surf and My Morning Jacket. In an effort to aim the album toward both younger and older audiences the label decided to bundle the new album with second disc comprising live performances of every track from History America 's Greatest Hits previously recorded at XM Radio as part of XM 's Then Again ... Live series recorded with longtime America drummer Willie Leacox guitarist Michael Woods and bassist Richard Campbell. In the run-up to the album 's scheduled release on 16 January 2007 America attracted publicity unknown to it since the early 1980s. The release itself was well received by critics and Here Now went all the way to number 52 in the Billboard charts. In addition to receiving growing support from new generation of musicians America finally began to receive acclamation from the entertainment industry. In 2006 America was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame. And on February 2012 the group was given star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for their contributions to music at 6752 Hollywood Boulevard. The band continued to perform over 100 shows per year. America 's follow-up to Here Now 2007 was released on 26 July 2011. Entitled Back Pages the album was collection of twelve tracks covering songs from artists ranging from Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell to Adam Schlesinger and the Gin Blossoms. Released on the E1 Music label the album was produced by Fred Mollin who had originally worked with America 31 years before on Alibi. The album was recorded in Nashville Tennessee with the help of number of studio musicians. The release of Back Pages was briefly overshadowed by the publicity surrounding the sudden death of founding member Dan Peek on 24 July 2011. In February 2014 lead guitarist and background vocalist Michael Woods Woodz who had been with the touring band since the fall of 1977 announced his retirement from the band due to ill health. His replacement was Nashville musician Bill Worrell. In March 2014 long-time Beach Boys and Brian Wilson vocalist/guitarist Jeff Foskett subbed for Beckley at some concerts and long-time drummer Willie Leacox retired from the band in July 2014 after an almost 42-year tenure and was replaced by former Reel Big Fish drummer Ryland Steen. In November 2014 America recorded live performance at Infinity Hall in Hartford CT for Connecticut Public Television that was subsequently aired nationwide in June 2015 and afterwards streamed online. During late summer 2015 guitarist/keyboardist Andy Barr from the group Cobra Starship came in for Worrell who had broken wrist. After healing Worrell returned to the group until leaving for solo career in October 2016. Barr then joined America permanently but left himself for solo career and was replaced by Steve Fekete in 2018. Long time America bassist David Dickey died on December 2016 at his home in Sweetwater Texas.In May 2019 Gonzo Multimedia released deluxe boxed set of America 's 2018 show at the London Palladium titled America Live at The Palladium featuring their greatest hits. America cancelled string of shows in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Dan Peek From the time Dan Peek left the group in May 1977 and up until his death in July 2011 speculation abounded as to whether he could or would return to the fold. On Peek 's 1978 solo debut album All Things Are Possible Beckley and Bunnell sang back-up vocals on the track Love Was Just Another Word. According to Peek and Bunnell in June 1983 Peek even joined the group onstage to perform few songs during concert at the Greek Theater in Los Angeles. On Peek 's 1984 follow-up album Doer of the Word Beckley provided prominent backing vocals on the title track. In November 1999 credible rumours began to spread that unreleased demo recordings from the early 1980s featuring Beckley and Bunnell collaborating with Peek would be released on CD sometime in early 2000. No such recordings have been released to date. The questions about possible reunion of the original trio began not long after Peek left the group. When asked about the prospects for reunion in the early 1980s Beckley and Bunnell stated that they were happy for Peek in that he had found new life and new direction but that it was unlikely there would be reunion. All things are possible like Dan says Beckley told radio host Lew Irwin in 1982 but it just does n't seem in the cards. Within few years however Peek had begun to entertain just such thoughts publicly. Like they said and like said all things are possible Peek told interviewer Steve Orchard in 1985. really have my fingers crossed. would love to get back together with them and do some things. Although Beckley and Bunnell had over the years become increasingly firm in their position that reunion with Peek was unlikely and could in fact be counterproductive record companies tried to persuade them to change their minds. Bunnell noted to Steve Orchard in 1998 that had few labels say that they would be interested in recording us if we would bring Dan back or if we could put together the original trio. Beckley and Bunnell chose to maintain their decision to remain duo. In 2000 Peek began posting number of weekly episodes to his website relating to his experiences prior to and during his years in America. Peek raised few eyebrows both for his candid discussion of his experiences with drugs and religion and for his observations of Beckley and Bunnell. Eventually Peek compiled the material into book entitled An American Band which was released in late 2004. Certain sources have suggested erroneously that reunion with Peek actually did occur. Rolling Stone rock music discography book printed during the mid-1990s contained an apocryphal entry for America stating that Dan Peek had reunited with Beckley and Bunnell for tour in 1993 with the Beach Boys. This misinformation has been so widely disseminated that the Australian rock journalist and historian Glenn A. Baker erroneously assumed this to be true in an interview question posed to Beckley and Bunnell on the Live at the Sydney Opera House DVD. Furthermore during an interview airing on June 2010 on the Steel Pier Radio Show with Ed Hurst airing on WIBG Radio Peek was asked about the reunion prospects and more or less ruled them out. The last song Peek recorded was Kiss Me on the Waves 2011 with the Spanish band Etcetera as guest singer. The song was written by Guillermo Albelo and included in the album Steps on the Water. Continuous speculations of Peek reuniting with America finally came to an end when Peek died in his home in Farmington Missouri of fibrinous pericarditis on 24 July 2011 at the age of 60.

Album,An album is collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc CD vinyl audio tape or another medium such as digital distribution. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records collected in bound book resembling photograph album this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing LP records played at 33+1⁄3 rpm. The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the cassette tape during the 1970s and early 1980s the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s. Most albums are recorded in studio although they may also be recorded in concert venue at home in the field or mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately and then brought or mixed together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed live even when done in studio. Studios are built to absorb sound eliminating reverberation to assist in mixing different takes other locations such as concert venues and some live rooms have reverberation which creates live sound. Recordings including live may contain editing sound effects voice adjustments etc. With modern recording technology artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones with each part recorded as separate track. Album covers and liner notes are used and sometimes additional information is provided such as analysis of the recording and lyrics or librettos. Historically the term album was applied to collection of various items housed in book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later collections of related 78 rpm records were bundled in book-like albums one side of 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound. When LP records were introduced collection of pieces or songs on single record was called an album the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc MiniDisc compact audio cassette 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.,An album is collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc CD vinyl audio tape or another medium such as digital distribution.

History An album Latin albus white in ancient Rome was board chalked or painted white on which decrees edicts and other public notices were inscribed in black. It was from this that in medieval and modern times album came to denote book of blank pages in which verses autographs sketches photographs and the like are collected. This in turn led to the modern meaning of an album as collection of audio recordings issued as single item. In the early nineteenth century album was occasionally used in the titles of some classical music sets such as Robert Schumann 's Album for the Young Opus 68 set of 43 short pieces.With the advent of 78 rpm records in the early 1900s the typical 10-inch disc could only hold about three minutes of sound per side so almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. Classical-music and spoken-word items generally were released on the longer 12-inch 78s playing around 4–5 minutes per side. For example in 1924 George Gershwin recorded drastically shortened version of his new seventeen-minute composition Rhapsody in Blue with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. The recording was issued on both sides of single record Victor 55225 and ran for 8m 59s. By 1910 though some European record companies had issued albums of complete operas and other works the practice of issuing albums was not widely taken up by American record companies until the 1920s. By about 1910 bound collections of empty sleeves with paperboard or leather cover similar to photograph album were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records the term record album was printed on some covers. These albums came in both 10-inch and 12-inch sizes. The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside allowing the record album to be placed on shelf upright like book suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them. In the 1930s record companies began issuing collections of 78 rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover. Most albums included three or four records with two sides each making six or eight compositions per album.The 10-inch and 12-inch LP record long play or 33+1⁄3 rpm microgroove vinyl record is gramophone record format introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. single LP record often had the same or similar number of tunes as typical album of 78s and it was adopted by the record industry as standard format for the album. Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. The term album was extended to other recording media such as 8-track tape audio cassette compact disc MiniDisc and digital albums as they were introduced. As part of trend of shifting sales in the music industry some observers feel that the early 21st century experienced the death of the album. Length An album may contain any number of tracks. In the United States The Recording Academy 's rules for Grammy Awards state that an album must comprise minimum total playing time of 15 minutes with at least five distinct tracks or minimum total playing time of 30 minutes with no minimum track requirement. In the United Kingdom the criteria for the UK Albums Chart is that recording counts as an album if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than 25 minutes. Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as mini-albums or EPs. Albums such as Tubular Bells Amarok and Hergest Ridge by Mike Oldfield and Yes Close to the Edge include fewer than four tracks but still surpass the 25-minute mark. The album Dopesmoker by Sleep contains only single track but the composition is over 63 minutes long. There are no formal rules against artists such as Pinhead Gunpowder referring to their own releases under thirty minutes as albums. If an album becomes too long to fit onto single vinyl record or CD it may be released as double album where two vinyl LPs or compact discs are packaged together in single case or triple album containing three LPs or compact discs. Recording artists who have an extensive back catalogue may re-release several CDs in one single box with unified design often containing one or more albums in this scenario these releases can sometimes be referred to as two or three -fer or compilation of previously unreleased recordings. These are known as box sets. Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once in the form of boxed sets although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album. Tracks Material music or sounds is stored on an album in sections termed tracks normally 12 tracks. music track often simply referred to as track is an individual song or instrumental recording. The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles. When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side. On compact disc the track number is indexed so that player can jump straight to the start of any track. On digital music stores such as iTunes the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content. track that has the same name as the album is called the title track. Bonus tracks bonus track also known as bonus cut or bonus is piece of music which has been included as an extra. This may be done as marketing promotion or for other reasons. It is not uncommon to include singles B-sides live recordings and demo recordings as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums where those tracks were n't originally included. Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves bonus tracks may be included if customer buys whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist. The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as stand-alone download adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album. In contrast to hidden tracks bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have gap of silence between other album tracks. Bonus tracks on CD or vinyl albums are common in Japan for releases by European and North American artists since importing international copies of the album can be cheaper than buying domestically released version Japanese releases often feature bonus tracks to incentivize domestic purchase. Audio formats Non-audio printed format Commercial sheet music are published in conjunction with the release of new album studio compilation soundtrack etc. matching folio songbook is compilation of the music notation of all the songs included in that particular album. It typically has the album 's artwork on its cover and in addition to sheet music it includes photos of the artist. Most pop and rock releases come in standard Piano/Vocal/Guitar notation format and occasionally Easy Piano E-Z Play Today. Rock-oriented releases may also come in Guitar Recorded Versions edition which are note-for-note transcriptions written directly from artist recordings. Vinyl records Vinyl LP records have two sides each comprising one-half of the album. If pop or rock album contained tracks released separately as commercial singles they were conventionally placed in particular positions on the album. During the Sixties particularly in the UK singles were generally released separately from albums. Today many commercial albums of music tracks feature one or more singles which are released separately to radio TV or the Internet as way of promoting the album. Albums have been issued that are compilations of older tracks not originally released together such as singles not originally found on albums b-sides of singles or unfinished demo recordings.Double albums during the Seventies were sometimes sequenced for record changers. In the case of two-record set for example sides and would be stamped on one record and sides and on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an automatic record changer with side on the bottom and side on the other record on top. Side would automatically drop onto the turntable and be played. When finished the tone arm 's position would trigger mechanism which moved the arm out of the way dropped the record with side and played it. When both records had been played the user would pick up the stack turn it over and put them back on the spindle—sides and would then play in sequence. Record changers were used for many years of the LP era but eventually fell out of use. 8-track tape 8-track tape formally Stereo commonly known as the eight-track cartridge eight-track tape or simply eight-track is magnetic tape sound recording technology popular in the United States from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s when the Compact Cassette format took over. The format is regarded as an obsolete technology and was relatively unknown outside the United States the United Kingdom Canada and Australia.Stereo was created in 1964 by consortium led by Bill Lear of Lear Jet Corporation along with Ampex Ford Motor Company General Motors Motorola and RCA Victor Records RCA. It was further development of the similar Stereo-Pak four-track cartridge created by Earl Madman Muntz. later quadraphonic version of the format was announced by RCA in April 1970 and first known as Quad-8 then later changed to just Q8. Compact cassette The Compact Cassette was popular medium for distributing pre-recorded music from the early 1970s to the early 2000s. The first Compact Cassette was introduced by Philips in August 1963 in the form of prototype. Compact Cassettes became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony Walkman which allowed the person to control what they listened to. The Walkman was convenient because of its size the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with clip for belts or pants.The compact cassette used double-sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale. The music is recorded on both the and side of the tape with cassette being turned to play the other side of the album. Compact Cassettes were also popular way for musicians to record Demos or Demo Tapes of their music to distribute to various record labels in the hopes of acquiring recording contract.Compact cassettes also saw the creation of mixtapes which are tapes containing compilation of songs created by any average listener of music. The songs on mixtape generally relate to one another in some way whether it be conceptual theme or an overall sound. After the introduction of Compact discs the term Mixtape began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format.The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the 1990s after the release and distribution Compact Discs. The 2010s saw revival of Compact Cassettes by independent record labels and DIY musicians who preferred the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet. Compact disc The compact disc format replaced both the vinyl record and the cassette as the standard for the commercial mass-market distribution of physical music albums. After the introduction of music downloading and MP3 players such as the iPod US album sales dropped 54.6 from 2001 to 2009. The CD is digital data storage device which permits digital recording technology to be used to record and play-back the recorded music. MP3 albums and similar Most recently the MP3 audio format has matured revolutionizing the concept of digital storage. Early MP3 albums were essentially CD-rips created by early CD-ripping software and sometimes real-time rips from cassettes and vinyl. The so-called MP3 album is not necessarily just in MP3 file format in which higher quality formats such as FLAC and WAV can be used on storage media that MP3 albums reside on such as CD-R-ROMs hard drives flash memory e.g. thumbdrives MP3 players SD cards etc. Types of album The contents of the album are usually recorded in studio or live in concert though may be recorded in other locations such as at home as with JJ Cale 's Okie Beck 's Odelay David Gray 's White Ladder and others in the field as with early Blues recordings in prison or with mobile recording unit such as the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Studio Most albums are studio albums that is they are recorded in recording studio with equipment meant to give those overseeing the recording as much control as possible over the sound of the album. They minimize external noises and reverberations and have highly sensitive microphones and sound mixing equipment. In some studios each member of band records their part in separate rooms or even at separate times while listening to the other parts of the track with headphones to keep the timing right. In the 2000s with the advent of digital recording it became possible for musicians to record their part of song in another studio in another part of the world and send their contribution over digital channels to be included in the final product. Live Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing or multi-tracking are termed live even when done in studio. However the common understanding of live album is one that was recorded at concert with public audience even when the recording is overdubbed or multi-tracked. Concert or stage performances are recorded using remote recording techniques. Albums may be recorded at single concert or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause laughter and other noise from the audience monologues by the performers between pieces improvisation and so on. They may use multitrack recording direct from the stage sound system rather than microphones placed among the audience and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording. Notable early live albums include the double album of Benny Goodman The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert released in 1950. Live double albums later became popular during the 1970s. Appraising the concept in Christgau 's Record Guide Rock Albums of the Seventies 1981 Robert Christgau said most are profit-taking recaps marred by sound and format inappropriate to phonographic reproduction you ca n't put sights smells or fellowship on audio tape. But for Joe Cocker and Bette Midler and Bob-Dylan-in-the-arena the form makes compelling kind of sense.

Discography,Discography is the study and cataloging of published sound recordings often by specified artists or within identified music genres. The exact information included varies depending on the type and scope of the discography but discography entry for specific recording will often list such details as the names of the artists involved the time and place of the recording the title of the piece performed release dates chart positions and sales figures.A discography can also refer to the recordings catalogue of an individual artist group or orchestra. This is distinct from sessionography which is catalogue of recording sessions rather than catalogue of the records in whatever medium that are made from those recordings. The two are sometimes confused especially in jazz as specific release dates for jazz records are often difficult to ascertain and session dates are substituted as means of organizing an artist 's catalogue. Another more recent definition of discography refers to collection of musical recordings by performer or composer considered as body of work. For instance all studio albums by performer could collectively be considered their discography. The term discography was popularized in the 1930s by collectors of jazz records. Jazz fans did research and self-published discographies about when jazz records were made and what musicians were on the records as record companies did not commonly include that information on or with the records at that time. Two early jazz discographies were Rhythm on Record by Hilton Schleman and Hot Discography by Charles Delaunay.A compilation of performer 's piano rolls is called rollography.,Discography is the study and cataloging of published sound recordings often by specified artists or within identified music genres.

Production Destroy-Oh-Boy. was recorded at Coyote Studios in Brooklyn New York. All songs on the album are credited to the New Bomb Turks with the exception of the song Mr. Suit cover of the British punk rock band Wire 's song from their debut album Pink Flag 1977. Matt Reber the band 's bassist recalled that he did n't think anyone would like the album. Vocalist Eric Davidson said that he figured for sure it would be stacked in the back of Used Kids Records in Columbus and they 'd be putting them out in the dollar bins every couple of months. Reception Despite the band 's notions Destroy-Oh-Boy. was released to what AllMusic declared universally great reviews. Reviewing the album in 1993 Spin critic Chuck Eddy complimented New Bomb Turks as the only band can think of lately that even attempts to play punk rock as the rock'n'roll it was meant to be and that counts for something. The same year Alternative Press concluded that suddenly not only have both prole-threat punk bashery and destructo-rock found fresh voices they 've been melded into seamless new terror all its own. Mark Deming of AllMusic in retrospective review called Destroy-Oh-Boy. the kind of full-on flamethrower album that could make the most jaded cynic believe once again in the curative powers of punk rock. Track listing The LP version includes Spinnin Clock after Tattooed Apathetic Boys Cryin into the Beer of Drunk Man is omitted on the LP but appears as the b-side on the Dragstrip Riot single. Also single red vinyl of 'm Weak was released with B-side cover of The Rolling Stones Summer Romance on Get Hip records in 1993. version of the album also includes the songs Let 's Dress Up the Naked Truth and Hapless Attempt.

It is one of the most controversial films in French cinema due to its vulgarity depiction of sexual acts nudity and amorality. However Blier 's later acclaim for the rest of his filmography made it cult film for modern critics. Plot Jean-Claude and Pierrot harass and sexually assault an older woman in banlieue steal her purse and run away. After they evade their pursuers they loot the purse but are disappointed to find almost no money. They steal Citroën DS for joyride. When they bring it back at night the owner awaits them with his gun drawn. Pierrot runs away but is shot in the groin. Jean-Claude overpowers the owner stealing the gun and the car and also kidnapping Marie-Ange the woman the owner was with. After picking up Pierrot they drive to car mechanic they know to exchange the stolen DS for another car offering the mechanic the chance to rape Marie-Ange who seems apathetic. Leaving with the other car Jean-Claude and Pierrot force doctor at gunpoint to treat Pierrot 's wounds which are only superficial. They steal the doctor 's money and flee. When they come back to the mechanic he is angry that Marie-Ange was totally passive and apathetic during the rape. Pierrot fears that he has become impotent because of his wounds and suggests sabotaging the steering of the DS before giving it back to the owner imagining him having an accident on winding road. They go through with the plan and let Marie-Ange go but not before getting her address. Jean-Claude and Pierrot go to the country stealing bicycles and car from locals. When they have to stop at train crossing and see police arriving they flee their car and enter the almost empty train. They encounter young woman who is breastfeeding her child and force her to let Pierrot suckle on her breasts. This arouses all three and they begin to have sex before the woman notices that she has to leave the train at the station where her husband is waiting. After encountering police on the train station Jean-Claude and Pierrot decide to lay low and go to deserted coastal resort where they break into vacation home to stay there. They notice that the home belongs to family of three with daughter named Jacqueline. After finding Jacqueline 's bathing suit they smell it gleefully and estimate that she must be around 16 years old. They return to Marie-Ange and force her to have sex with both of them Pierrot again being able to get an erection. She again is totally passive frustrating both. She also tells them that the car owner has sold his sabotaged DS. With the help of Marie-Ange they break into the hair salon she works at. When she requests to be kissed and begins screaming and throwing things they shoot her in the leg and leave her bound in the salon. When their plan of seducing young women fails Jean-Claude suggests that an inmate in women 's prison would be sexually starving. They wait at the entrance of prison and see Jeanne be released. They follow her and suggest helping her which confuses Jeanne. While they are arguing at roadside Jean-Claude scares away driver with his gun which amuses Jeanne. Jean-Claude hands her his gun saying that she can trust them. They give her money to buy some clothes bring her to the beach and have lavish oyster dinner with her. On the car ride Jeanne passionately kisses both. All three check into hotel and have passionate sex. When Jean-Claude and Pierrot are sleeping Jeanne seemingly content commits suicide by shooting herself in the groin. Jean-Claude and Pierrot take the gun and Jeanne 's belongings and flee the hotel. When going through her belongings they notice through her correspondence that she has son named Jacques who is also in jail. When he is released several weeks later Jean-Claude and Pierrot tell him that Jeanne asked them to help him. They bring him to cottage where Marie-Ange is waiting and suggest that he should have sex with her. They are upset when they hear Marie-Ange seemingly reaching orgasm. Afterwards she explains that it was the timidity and awkwardness of the virgin Jacques which aroused her. Later Jacques suggests robbing an elderly person and asks for their gun to do it. Jean-Claude and Pierrot accompany him. They are shocked when the person is one of Jacques prison wardens. Jacques berates and shoots the warden and Jean-Claude and Pierrot flee with Marie-Ange. After stealing another car Marie-Ange has sex with each of them while driving now seemingly enjoying it very much. After Jean-Claude and Pierrot learn that they are wanted for the murder they want to leave Marie-Ange so that she is not connected to this crime but she refuses. So the three continue on the road stealing cars and trying to hitch-hike. When they encounter family in the countryside they force them to exchange cars their old stolen Citroën Traction Avant against new DS identical to the sabotaged one. The daughter of the family is amused by the situation and suggests their parents accept the deal. When she is hit by her father she breaks down and requests the three to take her with them which they do. When they find out that she is still virgin they deflower her with her consent. They note that her name is Jacqueline and when they smell her vagina they are sure that this is the Jacqueline whose bathing suit they found in the vacation home. Later they drop her off on the roadside and continue on. The film ends with the three driving at high speed with the DS along winding road climaxing with the sounds of an automobile crash. Cast Production Bertrand Blier based the screenplay on his own novel Les Valseuses which had been published by éditions Robert Laffont in 1972. The film was produced by CAPAC UPF and Prodis. Principal photography took place from 16 August to 24 October 1973. Locations were used in Valence Drôme.For the scene where the character played by Brigitte Fossey gets her breasts sucked by Patrick Dewaere 's the actress who slipped into this role was not frightened but Bertrand Blier still remembers moment when the actress got little scared because she had little dizziness when she was caught between the two guys one who sucked her and the other titillating her from behind. Release The film premiered in France on 20 March 1974. It was released in the United States on 13 May the same year and the United Kingdom on 23 October 1975. The film had total of 5,726,031 admissions in France where it was the third highest-grossing film of the year. Reception In 1974 Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times wrote Despite its occasional charm its several amusing moments and the touching scenes played by Jeanne Moreau Going Places is film of truly cynical decadence. It 's also not incidentally the most misogynistic movie can remember its hatred of women is palpable and embarrassing. ... came away from Going Places feeling that 'd spent two hours in the company of filmmaker would never want to meet. Pauline Kael on the other hand writing in The New Yorker said that Going Places was perhaps the first film from Europe since Breathless and Weekend and Last Tango in Paris to speak to us in new first hand way about sex and sex fantasies it did it in terse cool assured style ... with dreamy sort of displacement. In 1990 when the film was re-released in Los Angeles cinemas Kevin Thomas of the Los Angeles Times wrote Blier has gone on to notable and distinctive career but as worthy and quirky as his subsequent films have been none have packed the punch of his debut film which he based on his own novel. ... The road/buddy movie was scarcely new 16 years ago but Blier 's strategies in the telling of his sexual odyssey remain fresh outrageous and inspired. Thomas continued Jean-Claude is the precursor of all the earthy passionate men Depardieu has brought to life on the screen. What 's more Blier is interested more in Jean-Claude and Pierrot as sexual chauvinists than as petty criminals and as they learn to be more considerate lovers they become more likable. Above all they embody the sure-fire appeal of all movie anti-heroes free spirits who live entirely for the moment and at all times follow their impulse.

Chess,Chess is board game between two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi Chinese chess and shogi Japanese chess. Chess originated as chaturanga in ancient India and from there it made its way to Persia the Byzantine empire and the Arab world. Muslims brought chess to Europe via Spain Al Andalus and Italy Emirate of Sicily. Eastern Slavs spread it to the Kievan Rus and the Vikings carried the game as far as Iceland and England. The rules of the game evolved over the centuries with the last major changes being introduced in the 15th century and winning acceptance by the 19th century.Today chess is one of the world 's most popular games played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start each player controls sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns. The player controlling the white pieces moves first followed by the player controlling the black pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent 's king whereby the king is under immediate attack in check and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways game can end in draw. Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE the International Chess Federation. The first universally recognized World Chess Champion Wilhelm Steinitz claimed his title in 1886 Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. huge body of chess theory has developed since the game 's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics computer science and psychology. One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create chess-playing machine. In 1997 Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today 's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory.,"Chess is board game between two players.

Muslims brought chess to Europe via Spain Al Andalus and Italy Emirate of Sicily. Eastern Slavs spread it to the Kievan Rus and the Vikings carried the game as far as Iceland and England. The rules of the game evolved over the centuries with the last major changes being introduced in the 15th century and winning acceptance by the 19th century.Today chess is one of the world 's most popular games played by millions of people worldwide. Chess is an abstract strategy game and involves no hidden information. It is played on chessboard with 64 squares arranged in an eight-by-eight grid. At the start each player controls sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns. The player controlling the white pieces moves first followed by the player controlling the black pieces. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent 's king whereby the king is under immediate attack in check and there is no way for it to escape. There are also several ways game can end in draw. Organized chess arose in the 19th century. Chess competition today is governed internationally by FIDE the International Chess Federation. The first universally recognized World Chess Champion Wilhelm Steinitz claimed his title in 1886 Magnus Carlsen is the current World Champion. huge body of chess theory has developed since the game 's inception. Aspects of art are found in chess composition and chess in its turn influenced Western culture and art and has connections with other fields such as mathematics computer science and psychology. One of the goals of early computer scientists was to create chess-playing machine. In 1997 Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today 's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory. Rules The rules of chess are published by FIDE Fédération Internationale des Échecs chess 's international governing body in its Handbook. Rules published by national governing bodies or by unaffiliated chess organizations commercial publishers etc. may differ in some details. FIDE 's rules were most recently revised in 2023. Setup Chess pieces are divided into two different colored sets. While the sets might not be literally white and black e.g. the light set may be yellowish or off-white color the dark set may be brown or red they are always referred to as white and black. The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black respectively. Each set consists of sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns. Chess sets come in wide variety of styles for competition the Staunton pattern is preferred. The game is played on square board of eight rows called ranks and eight columns called files. By convention the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares common colors for chessboards are white and brown or white and dark green. The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo. Thus on White 's first rank from left to right the pieces are placed in the following order rook knight bishop queen king bishop knight rook. On the second rank is placed row of eight pawns. Black 's position mirrors White 's with an equivalent piece on the same file. The board is placed with light square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player. The correct positions of the king and queen may be remembered by the phrase queen on her own color i.e. the white queen begins on light square and the black queen on dark square. In competitive games the piece colors are allocated to players by the organizers in informal games the colors are usually decided randomly for example by coin toss or by one player concealing white pawn in one hand and black pawn in the other and having the opponent choose. Movement White moves first after which players alternate turns moving one piece per turn except for castling when two pieces are moved. piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent 's piece which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent 's piece occupies. Moving is compulsory player may not skip turn even when having to move is detrimental. Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece of either color except the knight which leaps over any intervening pieces. All pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is located on square to which they would be able to move if the square was unoccupied. The squares on which pawns can capture enemy pieces are marked in the diagram with black crosses. The king moves one square in any direction. There is also special move called castling that involves moving the king and rook. The king is the most valuable piece attacks on the king must be immediately countered and if this is impossible immediate loss of the game ensues see Check and checkmate below. rook can move any number of squares along rank or file but can not leap over other pieces. Along with the king rook is involved during the king 's castling move. bishop can move any number of squares diagonally but can not leap over other pieces. queen combines the power of rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank file or diagonal but can not leap over other pieces. knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank file or diagonal. Thus the move forms an -shape two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces. pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied black dots in the diagram. pawn can capture an opponent 's piece on square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square black crosses. It can not capture piece while advancing along the same file. pawn has two special moves the en passant capture and promotion. ==== Check and checkmate ==== When king is under immediate attack it is said to be in check. move in response to check is legal only if it results in position where the king is no longer in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece interposing piece between the checking piece and the king which is possible only if the attacking piece is queen rook or bishop and there is square between it and the king or moving the king to square where it is not under attack. Castling is not permissible response to check.The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent this occurs when the opponent 's king is in check and there is no legal way to get it out of check. It is never legal for player to make move that puts or leaves the player 's own king in check. In casual games it is common to announce check when putting the opponent 's king in check but this is not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments. ==== Castling ==== Once per game each king can make move known as castling. Castling consists of moving the king two squares toward rook of the same color on the same rank and then placing the rook on the square that the king crossed. Castling is permissible if the following conditions are met Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game. There are no pieces between the king and the rook. The king is not in check and does not pass through or land on any square attacked by an enemy piece.Castling is still permitted if the rook is under attack or if the rook crosses an attacked square. For castling notation see Notation. ==== En passant ==== When pawn makes two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent 's pawn on square next to the destination square on an adjacent file then the opponent 's pawn can capture it en passant in passing moving to the square the pawn passed over. This can be done only on the turn immediately following the enemy pawn 's two-square advance otherwise the right to do so is forfeited. For example in the animated diagram the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5 and the white pawn on f5 can take it en passant on g6 but only immediately after the black pawn 's advance. ==== Promotion ==== When pawn advances to its eighth rank as part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player 's choice of queen rook bishop or knight of the same color. Usually the pawn is chosen to be promoted to queen but in some cases another piece is chosen this is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted. There is no restriction on the piece promoted to so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game e.g. two or more queens. If the required piece is not available e.g. second queen an inverted rook is sometimes used as substitute but this is not recognized in FIDE-sanctioned games. End of the game ==== Win ==== game can be won in the following ways Checkmate The king is in check and the player has no legal move. See check and checkmate above. Resignation player may resign conceding the game to the opponent. However if the opponent has no way of checkmating the resigned player this is draw under FIDE Laws. Most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in hopeless position. Win on time In games with time control player wins if the opponent runs out of time even if the opponent has superior position as long as the player has theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue. Forfeit player who cheats violates the rules or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited. Occasionally both players are forfeited. ==== Draw ==== There are several ways game can end in draw Stalemate If the player to move has no legal move but is not in check the position is stalemate and the game is drawn. Dead position If neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves the game is drawn. For example if only the kings are on the board all other pieces having been captured checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule. On the other hand if both players still have knight there is highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate so this rule does not apply. The dead position rule supersedes the previous rule which referred to insufficient material extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns can not be attacked. Draw by agreement In tournament chess draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw make move then start the opponent 's clock. Traditionally players have been allowed to agree to draw at any point in the game occasionally even without playing move in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty. Threefold repetition This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring disadvantage. In this situation either player can claim draw this requires the players to keep valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for claim to be valid. The addition of the fivefold repetition rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene immediately and declare the game draw after five occurrences of the same position consecutive or otherwise without requiring claim by either player. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check this is merely specific type of draw by threefold repetition. Fifty-move rule If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made either player can claim draw. The addition of the seventy-five-move rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene and immediately declare the game drawn after 75 moves without pawn move or capture without requiring claim by either player. There are several known endgames where it is possible to force mate but it requires more than 50 moves before pawn move or capture is made examples include some endgames with two knights against pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops. Historically FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty-move rule to make exceptions for these endgames but these have since been repealed. Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule. Draw on time In games with time control the game is drawn if player is out of time and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate the player. Draw by resignation Under FIDE Laws game is drawn if player resigns and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate that player. Time control In competition chess games are played with time control. If player 's time runs out before the game is completed the game is automatically lost provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate. The duration of game ranges from long or classical games which can take up to seven hours even longer if adjournments are permitted to bullet chess under minutes per player for the entire game. Intermediate between these are rapid chess games lasting between one and two hours per game popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments. Time is controlled using chess clock that has two displays one for each player 's remaining time. Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks which allow for time controls with increments. Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competitions. typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves. Notation Historically many different notation systems have been used to record chess moves the standard system today is short-form algebraic notation. In this system each square is uniquely identified by set of coordinates a–h for the files followed by 1–8 for the ranks. The usual format is initial of the piece moved file of destination square rank of destination squareThe pieces are identified by their initials. In English these are king queen rook bishop and knight is used to avoid confusion with king. For example Qg5 means queen moves to the g-file 5th rank that is to the square g5. Different initials may be used for other languages. In chess literature figurine algebraic notation FAN is frequently used to aid understanding independent of language. To resolve ambiguities an additional letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved e.g. Ngf3 means knight from the g-file moves to the square f3 R1e2 means rook on the first rank moves to e2. For pawns no letter initial is used so e4 means pawn moves to the square e4. If the piece makes capture is usually inserted before the destination square. Thus Bxf3 means bishop captures on f3. When pawn makes capture the file from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn making the capture for example exd5 pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5. Ranks may be omitted if unambiguous for example exd pawn on the e-file captures piece somewhere on the d-file. minority of publications use to indicate capture and some omit the capture symbol altogether. In its most abbreviated form exd5 may be rendered simply as ed. An en passant capture may optionally be marked with the notation e.p. If pawn moves to its last rank achieving promotion the piece chosen is indicated after the move for example e1=Q or e1Q. Castling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 or O-O for kingside castling and 0-0-0 or O-O-O for queenside castling. move that places the opponent 's king in check usually has the notation added. There are no specific notations for discovered check or double check. Checkmate can be indicated by. At the end of the game 1–0 means White won 0–1 means Black won and ½–½ indicates draw. Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols. For example. indicates good move. an excellent move. mistake. blunder. an interesting move that may not be best or. dubious move not easily refuted. For example one variation of simple trap known as the Scholar 's mate see animated diagram can be recorded 1. e4 e5. Qh5. Nc6. Bc4 Nf6. . Qxf7 Variants of algebraic notation include long form algebraic in which both the departure and destination square are indicated abbreviated algebraic in which capture signs check signs and ranks of pawn captures may be omitted and Figurine Algebraic Notation used in chess publications for universal readability regardless of language. Portable Game Notation PGN is text-based file format for recording chess games based on short form English algebraic notation with small amount of markup. PGN files suffix .pgn can be processed by most chess software as well as being easily readable by humans. Until about 1980 the majority of English language chess publications used descriptive notation in which files are identified by the initial letter of the piece that occupies the first rank at the beginning of the game. In descriptive notation the common opening move 1.e4 is rendered as 1.P-K4 pawn to king four. Another system is ICCF numeric notation recognized by the International Correspondence Chess Federation though its use is in decline. In competitive games players are normally required to keep score record of the game. For this purpose only algebraic notation is recognized in FIDE-sanctioned events game scores recorded in different notation system may not be used as evidence in the event of dispute. Organized competition Tournaments and matches Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues tournaments and congresses. Thousands of chess tournaments matches and festivals are held around the world every year catering to players of all levels. Tournaments with small number of players may use the round-robin format in which every player plays one game against every other player. For large numbers of players the Swiss system may be used in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same or as similar as possible score in each round. In either case player 's score is usually calculated as point for each game won and one-half point for each game drawn. Variations such as football scoring points for win point for draw may be used by tournament organizers but ratings are always calculated on the basis of standard scoring. There are different ways to denote player 's score in match or tournament most commonly P/G points scored out of games played e.g. 5½/8 P–A points for and points against e.g. 5½–2½ or +W−L=D wins losses draws e.g. +4−1=3. The term match refers not to an individual game but to either series of games between two players or team competition in which each player of one team plays one game against player of the other team. Governance Chess 's international governing body is usually known by its French acronym FIDE pronounced FEE-day French Fédération internationale des échecs or International Chess Federation. FIDE 's membership consists of the national chess organizations of over 180 countries there are also several associate members including various supra-national organizations the International Braille Chess Association IBCA International Committee of Chess for the Deaf ICCD and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association IPCA. FIDE is recognized as sports governing body by the International Olympic Committee but chess has never been part of the Olympic Games. FIDE 's most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship role it assumed in 1948. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway. The reigning Women 's World Champion is Ju Wenjun from China.Other competitions for individuals include the World Junior Chess Championship the European Individual Chess Championship the tournaments for the World Championship qualification cycle and the various national championships. Invitation-only tournaments regularly attract the world 's strongest players. Examples include Spain 's Linares event Monte Carlo 's Melody Amber tournament the Dortmund Sparkassen meeting Sofia 's M-tel Masters and Wijk aan Zee 's Tata Steel tournament. Regular team chess events include the Chess Olympiad and the European Team Chess Championship. The World Chess Solving Championship and World Correspondence Chess Championships include both team and individual events these are held independently of FIDE. Titles and rankings In order to rank players FIDE ICCF and most national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. An average club player has rating of about 1500 the highest FIDE rating of all time 2882 was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.Players may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE Grandmaster GM sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion Grandmaster is the highest title chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on player the player must have an Elo rating of at least 2500 at one time and three results of prescribed standard called norms in tournaments involving other grandmasters including some from countries other than the applicant 's. There are other milestones player can achieve to attain the title such as winning the World Junior Championship. International Master IM. The conditions are similar to GM but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400. FIDE Master FM. The usual way for player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving FIDE rating of 2300 or more. Candidate Master CM. Similar to FM but with FIDE rating of at least 2200.The above titles are open to both men and women. There are also separate women-only titles Woman Grandmaster WGM Woman International Master WIM Woman FIDE Master WFM and Woman Candidate Master WCM. These require performance level approximately 200 Elo rating points below the similarly named open titles and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial. Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978 number of women have earned the open GM title.FIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers. International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players by the International Correspondence Chess Federation. National chess organizations may also award titles. Theory Chess has an extensive literature. In 1913 the chess historian H.J.R. Murray estimated the total number of books magazines and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000. B.H. Wood estimated the number as of 1949 to be about 20,000. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that Since then there has been steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed. Significant public chess libraries include the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals and the Chess Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands with about 30,000 books.Chess theory usually divides the game of chess into three phases with different sets of strategies the opening typically the first 10 to 20 moves when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle the middlegame and last the endgame when most of the pieces are gone kings typically take more active part in the struggle and pawn promotion is often decisive. Opening theory is concerned with finding the best moves in the initial phase of the game. There are dozens of different openings and hundreds of variants. The Oxford Companion to Chess lists 1,327 named openings and variants.Middlegame theory is usually divided into chess tactics and chess strategy. Chess strategy concentrates on setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game for example where to place different pieces while tactics concerns immediate maneuver. These two aspects of the gameplay can not be completely separated because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. Endgame theory is concerned with positions where there are only few pieces left. Theoretics categorize these positions according to the pieces for example King and pawn endings or Rook versus minor piece. Opening chess opening is the group of initial moves of game the opening moves. Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense. They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are dozens of different openings varying widely in character from quiet positional play for example the Réti Opening to very aggressive the Latvian Gambit. In some opening lines the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves. Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve. The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar development This is the technique of placing the pieces particularly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game. control of the center Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily and can also have cramping effect on the opponent. king safety It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. correctly timed castling can often enhance this. pawn structure Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands and to force such weaknesses in the opponent 's position.Most players and theoreticians consider that White by virtue of the first move begins the game with small advantage. This initially gives White the initiative. Black usually strives to neutralize White 's advantage and achieve equality or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position. Middlegame The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. Similarly there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame see start of the endgame. Because the opening theory has ended players have to form plans based on the features of the position and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent 's king. Some typical patterns have their own names for example the Boden 's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in specific type of pawn structure. An example is the minority attack which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame i.e. simplify. Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose for example if one side keeps light-squared bishop and the opponent has dark-squared one the transformation into bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be draw even with an advantage of pawn or sometimes even with two-pawn advantage. ==== Tactics ==== In chess tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by human player or computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player 's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical while in positions with limited number of forced variations strong players can calculate long sequences of moves. Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers for example pins forks skewers batteries discovered attacks especially discovered checks zwischenzugs deflections decoys sacrifices underminings overloadings and interferences. Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions threats exchanges of material and double attacks can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players. forced variation that involves sacrifice and usually results in tangible gain is called combination. Brilliant combinations such as those in the Immortal Game are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. common type of chess exercise aimed at developing players skills is position where decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it. ==== Strategy ==== Chess strategy is concerned with the evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for future play. During the evaluation players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board control of the center and centralization the pawn structure king safety and the control of key squares or groups of squares for example diagonals open files and dark or light squares. The most basic step in evaluating position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides. The point values used for this purpose are based on experience usually pawns are considered worth one point knights and bishops about three points each rooks about five points the value difference between rook and bishop or knight being known as the exchange and queens about nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined since its checkmate loses the game. But in practical terms in the endgame the king as fighting piece is generally more powerful than bishop or knight but less powerful than rook. These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece e.g. advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares coordination between pieces e.g. pair of bishops usually coordinate better than bishop and knight or the type of position e.g. knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions .Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is pawn structure sometimes known as the pawn skeleton the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the pieces pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in pawn structure include isolated doubled or backward pawns and holes once created they are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset for example by the possibility of developing an attack. Endgame The endgame also end game or ending is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame Pawns become more important. Endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank. The king which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame emerges as strong piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the center where it can protect its own pawns attack enemy pawns and hinder moves of the opponent 's king. Zugzwang situation in which the player who is to move is forced to incur disadvantage is often factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. In the example diagram either side having the move is in zugzwang Black to move must play ... Kb7 allowing White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7 White to move must permit draw either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board. Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king with the pieces working together with their king. For example king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings such as rook and pawn versus rook endgames. History Origins The earliest texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the 7th century. Three are written in Pahlavi Middle Persian and one the Harshacharita is in Sanskrit. One of these texts the Chatrang-namak represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess. The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang the Pahlavi word for chess was introduced to Persia by 'Dewasarm great ruler of India during the reign of Khosrow I.The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to about 840 written by al-Adli ar-Rumi 800–870 renowned Arab chess player titled Kitab ash-shatranj The Book of Chess. This is lost manuscript but is referenced in later works. Here also al-Adli attributes the origins of Persian chess to India along with the eighth-century collection of fables Kalīla wa-Dimna. By the twentieth century substantial consensus developed regarding chess 's origins in northwest India in the early 7th century. More recently this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny.The early forms of chess in India were known as chaturaṅga Sanskrit चतुरङ्ग literally four divisions of the military infantry cavalry elephants and chariotry represented by pieces which would later evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectively. Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board called ashtāpada. Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sasanian Persia around 600 A.D. where the game came to be known by the name chatrang Persian چترنگ. Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia 633–51 where it was then named shatranj Arabic شطرنج Persian شترنج with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez al-shatranj in Portuguese as xadrez and in Greek as ζατρίκιον zatrikion which comes directly from the Persian chatrang but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh king from which the English words check and chess descend. The word checkmate is derived from the Persian shāh māt the king is dead. Xiangqi is the form of chess best-known in China. The eastern migration of chess into China and Southeast Asia has even less documentation than its migration west making it largely conjectured. The word xiàngqí 象棋 was used in China to refer to game from 569 A.D. at the latest but it has not been proven if this game was or was not directly related to chess. The first reference to Chinese chess appears in book entitled Xuán guaì lù 玄怪錄 Record of the Mysterious and Strange dating to about 800. minority view holds that western chess arose from xiàngqí or one of its predecessors although this has been contested. Chess historians Jean-Louis Cazaux and Rick Knowlton contend that xiangqi 's intrinsic characteristics make it easier to construct an evolutionary path from China to India/Persia than the opposite direction.The oldest archaeological chess artifacts ivory pieces were excavated in ancient Afrasiab today 's Samarkand in Uzbekistan Central Asia and date to about 760 with some of them possibly being older. Remarkably almost all findings of the oldest pieces come from along the Silk Road from the former regions of the Tarim Basin today 's Xinjiang in China Transoxiana Sogdiana Bactria Gandhara to Iran on one end and to India through Kashmir on the other.The game reached Western Europe and Russia via at least three routes the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout both the Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe. Latin poem called Versus de scachis Verses on Chess dated to the late 10th century has been preserved at Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland. 1200–1700 introduction of new rules The game of chess was then played and known in all European countries. famous 13th-century Spanish manuscript covering chess backgammon and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos which is the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games. The rules were fundamentally similar to those of the Arabic shatranj. The differences were mostly in the use of checkered board instead of plain monochrome board used by Arabs and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step. In some regions the Queen which had replaced the Wazir and/or the King could also make an initial two-square leap under some conditions. Around 1200 the rules of shatranj started to be modified in Spain Italy and the rest of Southern Europe culminating several major changes later in the emergence of modern chess practically as it is known today. major change was the modern piece movement rules which began to appear in intellectual circles in Valencia Spain around 1475 which established the foundations and brought it very close to current Chess. These new rules then were quickly adopted in Italy and Southern France before diffusing into the rest of Europe. Pawns gained the ability to advance two squares on their first move while bishops and queens acquired their modern movement powers. The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece toward the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece in light of that modern chess was often referred to at the time as Queen 's Chess or Mad Queen Chess. Castling derived from the king 's leap usually in combination with pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety was introduced. These new rules quickly spread throughout Western Europe. Writings about chess theory began to appear in the late 15th century. An anonymous treatise on chess of 1490 with the first part containing some openings and the second 30 endgames is deposited in the library of the University of Göttingen. The book El Libro dels jochs partitis dels schachs en nombre de 100 was written by Francesc Vicent in Segorbe in 1495 but no copy of this work has survived. The Repetición de Amores Arte de Ajedrez Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess by Spanish churchman Luis Ramírez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames. 1700–1873 Romantic era In the 18th century the center of European chess life moved from Southern Europe to mainland France. The two most important French masters were François-André Danican Philidor musician by profession who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy and later Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais who won famous series of matches against Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834. Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson 's Divan in London.At the same time the intellectual movement of romanticism had had far-reaching impact on chess with aesthetics and tactical beauty being held in higher regard than objective soundness and strategic planning. As result virtually all games began with the Open Game and it was considered unsportsmanlike to decline gambits that invited tactical play such as the King 's Gambit and the Evans Gambit. This chess philosophy is known as Romantic chess and sharp tactical style consistent with the principles of chess romanticism was predominant until the late 19th century.The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century. Also in the 19th century the convention that White moves first was established formerly either White or Black could move first. Finally the rules around castling and en passant captures were standardized variations in these rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century. The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess or international chess particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent. Since the 19th century the only rule changes such as the establishment of the correct procedure for claiming draw by repetition have been technical in nature. As the 19th century progressed chess organization developed quickly. Many chess clubs chess books and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities for example the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824. Chess problems became regular part of 19th-century newspapers Bernhard Horwitz Josef Kling and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843 von der Lasa published his and Bilguer 's Handbuch des Schachspiels Handbook of Chess the first comprehensive manual of chess theory. The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton leading English chess player and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant energetic attacking style was typical for the time. Sparkling games like Anderssen 's Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphy 's Opera Game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the art of chess.Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul Morphy an extraordinary chess prodigy. Morphy won against all important competitors except Staunton who refused to play including Anderssen during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy 's success stemmed from combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks. 1873–1945 Birth of sport Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz laid the foundations for scientific approach to the game the art of breaking position down into components and preparing correct plans. In addition to his theoretical achievements Steinitz founded an important tradition his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. This win marked stylistic transition at the highest levels of chess from an attacking tactical style predominant in the Romantic era to more positional strategic style introduced to the chess world by Steinitz. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to much younger player the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker who maintained this title for 27 years the longest tenure of any world champion.After the end of the 19th century the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew. The first Olympiad was held in Paris in 1924 and FIDE was founded initially for the purpose of organizing that event. In 1927 the Women 's World Chess Championship was established the first to hold the title was Czech-English master Vera Menchik.A prodigy from Cuba José Raúl Capablanca known for his skill in endgames won the World Championship from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years from 1916 to 1924. His successor 1927 was the Russian-French Alexander Alekhine strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946. Alekhine briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later.In the interwar period chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti. They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack. 1945–1990 Post-World War II era After the death of Alekhine new World Champion was sought. FIDE which has controlled the title since then ran tournament of elite players. The winner of the 1948 tournament was Russian Mikhail Botvinnik. In 1950 FIDE established system of titles conferring the titles of Grandmaster and International Master on 27 players. Some sources state that in 1914 the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Lasker Capablanca Alekhine Tarrasch and Marshall but this is disputed claim. Botvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world which mainly through the Soviet government 's politically inspired efforts to demonstrate intellectual superiority over the West stood almost uninterrupted for more than half-century. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union there was only one non-Soviet champion American Bobby Fischer champion 1972–1975. Botvinnik also revolutionized opening theory. Previously Black strove for equality attempting to neutralize White 's first-move advantage. As Black Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning. In the previous informal system of World Championships the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up new system of qualifying tournaments and matches. The world 's strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go through the Candidates stage which was initially tournament and later series of knockout matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title. champion defeated in match had right to play rematch year later. This system operated on three-year cycle. Botvinnik participated in championship matches over period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957 he lost to Vasily Smyslov but regained the title in rematch in 1958. In 1960 he lost the title to the 23-year-old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal an accomplished tactician and attacking player who is widely regarded as one of the most creative players ever hence his nickname the magician from Riga. Botvinnik again regained the title in rematch in 1961. Following the 1961 event FIDE abolished the automatic right of deposed champion to rematch and the next champion Armenian Tigran Petrosian player renowned for his defensive and positional skills held the title for two cycles 1963–1969. His successor Boris Spassky from Russia champion 1969–1972 won games in both positional and sharp tactical style. The next championship the so-called Match of the Century saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II American Bobby Fischer. Fischer defeated his opponents in the Candidates matches by unheard-of margins and convincingly defeated Spassky for the world championship. The match was followed closely by news media of the day leading to surge in popularity for chess it also held significant political importance at the height of the Cold War with the match being seen by both sides as microcosm of the conflict between East and West. In 1975 however Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when he was unable to reach agreement on conditions with FIDE and Karpov obtained the title by default. Fischer modernized many aspects of chess especially by extensively preparing openings.Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with string of tournament successes. In the 1984 World Chess Championship Karpov faced his toughest challenge to date the young Garry Kasparov from Baku Soviet Azerbaijan. The match was aborted in controversial circumstances after months and 48 games with Karpov leading by wins to but evidently exhausted many commentators believed Kasparov who had won the last two games would have won the match had it continued. Kasparov won the 1985 rematch. Kasparov and Karpov contested three further closely fought matches in 1986 1987 and 1990 Kasparov winning them all. Kasparov became the dominant figure of world chess from the mid 1980s until his retirement from competition in 2005. ==== Beginnings of chess technology ==== Chess-playing computer programs later known as chess engines began to appear in the 1960s. In 1970 the first major computer chess tournament the North American Computer Chess Championship was held followed in 1974 by the first World Computer Chess Championship. In the late 1970s dedicated home chess computers such as Fidelity Electronics Chess Challenger became commercially available as well as software to run on home computers. However the overall standard of computer chess was low until the 1990s. The first endgame tablebases which provided perfect play for relatively simple endgames such as king and rook versus king and bishop appeared in the late 1970s. This set precedent to the complete six- and seven-piece tablebases that became available in the 2000s and 2010s respectively.The first commercial chess database collection of chess games searchable by move and position was introduced by the German company ChessBase in 1987. Databases containing millions of chess games have since had profound effect on opening theory and other areas of chess research. Digital chess clocks were invented in 1973 though they did not become commonplace until the 1990s. Digital clocks allow for time controls involving increments and delays. 1990–present Rise of computers and online chess ==== Technology ==== The Internet enabled online chess as new medium of playing with chess servers allowing users to play other people from different parts of the world in real time. The first such server known as Internet Chess Server or ICS was developed at the University of Utah in 1992. ICS formed the basis for the first commercial chess server the Internet Chess Club which was launched in 1995 and for other early chess servers such as FICS Free Internet Chess Server. Since then many other platforms have appeared and online chess began to rival over-the-board chess in popularity. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic the isolation ensuing from quarantines imposed in many places around the world combined with the success of the popular Netflix show The Queen 's Gambit and other factors such as the popularity of online tournaments notably PogChamps and chess Twitch streamers resulted in surge of popularity not only for online chess but for the game of chess in general this phenomenon has been referred to in the media as the 2020 online chess boom.Computer chess has also seen major advances. By the 1990s chess engines could consistently defeat most amateurs and in 1997 Deep Blue defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in six-game match starting an era of computer dominance at the highest level of chess. In the 2010s engines of superhuman strength became accessible for free on number of PC and mobile platforms and free engine analysis became commonplace feature on internet chess servers. An adverse effect of the easy availability of engine analysis on hand-held devices and personal computers has been the rise of computer cheating which has grown to be major concern in both over-the-board and online chess. In 2017 AlphaZero neural network also capable of playing shogi and Go was introduced. Since then many chess engines based on neural network evaluation have been written the best of which have surpassed the traditional brute-force engines. AlphaZero also introduced many novel ideas and ways of playing the game which affected the style of play at the top level.As endgame tablebases developed they began to provide perfect play in endgame positions in which the game-theoretical outcome was previously unknown such as positions with king queen and pawn against king and queen. In 1991 Lewis Stiller published tablebase for select six-piece endgames and by 2005 following the publication of Nalimov tablebases all six-piece endgame positions were solved. In 2012 Lomonosov tablebases were published which solved all seven-piece endgame positions. Use of tablebases enhances the performance of chess engines by providing definitive results in some branches of analysis. Technological progress made in the 1990s and the 21st century has influenced the way that chess is studied at all levels as well as the state of chess as spectator sport. Previously preparation at the professional level required an extensive chess library and several subscriptions to publications such as Chess Informant to keep up with opening developments and study opponents games. Today preparation at the professional level involves the use of databases containing millions of games and engines to analyze different opening variations and prepare novelties. number of online learning resources are also available for players of all levels such as online courses tactics trainers and video lessons.Since the late 1990s it has been possible to follow major international chess events online the players moves being relayed in real time. Sensory boards have been developed to enable automatic transmission of moves. Chess players will frequently run engines while watching these games allowing them to quickly identify mistakes by the players and spot tactical opportunities. While in the past the moves have been relayed live today chess organizers will often impose half-hour delay as an anti-cheating measure. In the mid-to-late 2010s and especially following the 2020 online boom it became commonplace for supergrandmasters such as Hikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlsen to livestream chess content on platforms such as Twitch. Also following the boom online chess started being viewed as an e-sport with e-sport teams signing chess players for the first time in 2020. ==== Growth ==== Organized chess even for young children has become common. FIDE holds world championships for age levels down to years old. The largest tournaments in number of players are those held for children.The number of grandmasters and other chess professionals has also grown in the modern era. Kenneth Regan and Guy Haworth conducted research involving comparison of move choices by players of different levels and from different periods with the analysis of strong chess engines they concluded that the increase in the number of grandmasters and higher Elo ratings of the top players reflect an actual increase in the average standard of play rather than rating inflation or title inflation. ==== Professional chess ==== In 1993 Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke ties with FIDE to organize their own match for the title and formed competing Professional Chess Association PCA. From then until 2006 there were two simultaneous World Championships and respective World Champions the PCA or classical champions extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays challenger in series of games and the other following FIDE 's new format of many players competing in large knockout tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his PCA title in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Due to the complicated state of world chess politics and difficulties obtaining commercial sponsorships Kasparov was never able to challenge for the title again. Despite this he continued to dominate in top level tournaments and remained the world 's highest rated player until his retirement from competitive chess in 2005. The World Chess Championship 2006 in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion. In September 2007 he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India who won the championship tournament in Mexico City. Anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008 2010 and 2012. In 2013 Magnus Carlsen of Norway beat Anand in the 2013 World Chess Championship. He defended his title times since then and is the reigning world champion. Connections Arts and humanities In the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance chess was part of noble culture it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the King 's Game. Gentlemen are to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes says the overview at the beginning of Baldassare Castiglione 's The Book of the Courtier 1528 English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby but chess should not be gentleman 's main passion. Castiglione explains it further And what say you to the game at chestes. It is truely an honest kynde of enterteynmente and wittie quoth Syr Friderick. But me think it hath fault whiche is that man may be to couning at it for who ever will be excellent in the playe of chestes beleave he must beestowe much tyme about it and applie it with so much study that man may assoone learne some noble scyence or compase any other matter of importaunce and yet in the ende in beestowing all that laboure he knoweth no more but game. Therfore in this beleave there happeneth very rare thing namely that the meane is more commendable then the excellency. Some of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy at least partially survive such as the Lewis chessmen. Chess was often used as basis of sermons on morality. An example is Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum 'Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess written by an Italian Dominican monk Jacobus de Cessolis c. 1300. This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages. The work was translated into many other languages the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in 1473 and was the basis for William Caxton 's The Game and Playe of the Chesse 1474 one of the first books printed in English. Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces The knyght ought to be made alle armed upon an hors in suche wyse that he haue an helme on his heed and spere in his ryght hande/ and coueryd wyth his sheld/ swerde and mace on his lyft syde/ Cladd wyth an hawberk and plates to fore his breste/ legge harnoys on his legges/ Spores on his heelis on his handes his gauntelettes/ his hors well broken and taught and apte to bataylle and couerid with his armes/ whan the knyghtes ben maad they ben bayned or bathed/ that is the signe that they shold lede newe lyf and newe maners/ also they wake alle the nyght in prayers and orysons vnto god that he wylle gyue hem grace that they may gete that thynge that they may not gete by nature/ The kynge or prynce gyrdeth boute them swerde in signe/ that they shold abyde and kepe hym of whom they take theyr dispenses and dignyte. Known in the circles of clerics students and merchants chess entered into the popular culture of the Middle Ages. An example is the 209th song of Carmina Burana from the 13th century which starts with the names of chess pieces Roch pedites regina .... The game of chess at times has been discouraged by various religious authorities in Middle Ages Jewish Catholic and Orthodox. Some Muslim authorities prohibited it even recently for example Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 and Abdul-Aziz ash-Sheikh even later.During the Age of Enlightenment chess was viewed as means of self-improvement. Benjamin Franklin in his article The Morals of Chess 1750 wrote The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement several very valuable qualities of the mind useful in the course of human life are to be acquired and strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all occasions for life is kind of Chess in which we have often points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with and in which there is vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effect of prudence or the want of it. By playing at Chess then we may learn I. Foresight which looks little into futurity and considers the consequences that may attend an action ... II. Circumspection which surveys the whole Chess-board or scene of action the relation of the several Pieces and their situations ... III. Caution not to make our moves too hastily .... Chess was occasionally criticized in the 19th century as waste of time.Chess is taught to children in schools around the world today. Many schools host chess clubs and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries hosted by organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.Chess is many times depicted in the arts significant works where chess plays key role range from Thomas Middleton 's Game at Chess to Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll to Vladimir Nabokov 's The Defense to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig. Chess has also featured in film classics such as Ingmar Bergman 's The Seventh Seal Satyajit Ray 's The Chess Players and Powell and Pressburger 's Matter of Life and Death. Chess is also present in contemporary popular culture. For example the characters in Star Trek play futuristic version of the game called Federation Tri-Dimensional Chess and Wizard 's Chess is played in J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter. Mathematics The game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics. Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess such as the knight 's tour and the eight queens puzzle have been known for hundreds of years. The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be 4.59 +/- 0.38 x1044 with 95 confidence level with game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10120 number known as the Shannon number. An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves but there may be as few as zero in the case of checkmate or stalemate or in constructed position as many as 218.In 1913 Ernst Zermelo used chess as basis for his theory of game strategies which is considered one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo 's theorem states that it is possible to solve chess i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of perfectly played game either White can force win or Black can force win or both sides can force at least draw. However with 1043 legal positions in chess it will take an impossibly long time to compute perfect strategy with any feasible technology. Psychology There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal rather than visuospatial ability lies at the core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of position. According to de Groot this perception made possible by years of practice and study is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill since masters and novices when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces had equivalent recall about six positions in each case. Rather it is the ability to recognize patterns which are then memorized which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game the masters had almost total positional recall.More recent research has focused on chess as mental training the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices blindfold chess the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill gender differences and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much empirical investigation. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research however fails to replicate their results and indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to the general population chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.A relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in scientific literature as well as in popular culture. Academic studies that investigate the relationship date back at least to 1927. Although one meta-analysis and most children studies find positive correlation between general cognitive ability and chess skill adult studies show mixed results. Composition Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems also called chess compositions. The creator is known as chess composer. There are many types of chess problems the two most important are Directmates White to move first and checkmate Black within specified number of moves against any defense. These are often referred to as mate in for example mate in three three-mover two- and three-move problems are the most common. These usually involve positions that would be highly unlikely to occur in an actual game and are intended to illustrate particular theme usually requiring surprising or counterintuitive key move. Themes associated with chess problems occasionally appear in actual games when they are referred to as problem-like moves. Studies orthodox problems where the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw. The majority of studies are endgame positions.Fairy chess is branch of chess problem composition involving altered rules such as the use of unconventional pieces or boards or unusual stipulations such as reflexmates. Tournaments for composition and solving of chess problems are organized by the World Federation for Chess Composition which works cooperatively with but independent of FIDE. The WFCC awards titles for composing and solving chess problems. Online chess Online chess is chess that is played over the internet allowing players to play against each other in real time. This is done through the use of Internet chess servers which pair up individual players based on their rating using an Elo or similar rating system. Online chess saw spike in growth during the quarantines of the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be attributed to both isolation and the popularity of Netflix miniseries The Queen 's Gambit which was released in October 2020. Chess app downloads on the App Store and Google Play Store rose by 63 after the show debuted. Chess.com saw more than twice as many account registrations in November as it had in previous months and the number of games played monthly on Lichess doubled as well. There was also demographic shift in players with female registration on Chess.com shifting from 22 to 27 of new players. GM Maurice Ashley said boom is taking place in chess like we have never seen maybe since the Bobby Fischer days attributing the growth to an increased desire to do something constructive during the pandemic. USCF Women 's Program Director Jennifer Shahade stated that chess works well on the internet since pieces do not need to be reset and matchmaking is virtually instant. Computer chess The idea of creating chess-playing machine dates to the 18th century around 1769 the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as hoax. Serious trials based on automata such as El Ajedrecista were too complex and limited to be useful. Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s chess enthusiasts computer engineers and computer scientists have built with increasing degrees of seriousness and success chess-playing machines and computer programs. The groundbreaking paper on computer chess Programming Computer for Playing Chess was published in 1950 by Claude Shannon. He wrote The chess machine is an ideal one to start with since the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations the moves and in the ultimate goal checkmate it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution chess is generally considered to require thinking for skillful play solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of thinking the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers. The Association for Computing Machinery ACM held the first major chess tournament for computers the North American Computer Chess Championship in September 1970. CHESS 3.0 chess program from Northwestern University won the championship. The first World Computer Chess Championship held in 1974 was won by the Soviet program Kaissa. At first considered only curiosity the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong. In 1997 computer won chess match using classical time controls against reigning World Champion for the first time IBM 's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ it scored two wins one loss and three draws. There was some controversy over the match and human–computer matches were relatively close over the next few years until convincing computer victories in 2005 and in 2006. In 2009 mobile phone won category tournament with performance rating of 2898 chess engine Hiarcs 13 running on the mobile phone HTC Touch HD won the Copa Mercosur tournament with nine wins and one draw. The best chess programs are now able to consistently beat the strongest human players to the extent that human–computer matches no longer attract interest from chess players or the media. While the World Computer Chess Championship still exists the Top Chess Engine Championship TCEC is widely regarded as the unofficial world championship for chess engines. The current champion is Stockfish. With huge databases of past games and high analytical ability computers can help players to learn chess and prepare for matches. Internet Chess Servers allow people to find and play opponents worldwide. The presence of computers and modern communication tools have raised concerns regarding cheating during games. Variants There are more than two thousand published chess variants games with similar but different rules. Most of them are of relatively recent origin. They include direct predecessors of chess such as chaturanga and shatranj traditional national or regional games that share common ancestors with Western chess such as xiangqi shogi janggi makruk sittuyin and shatar modern variations employing different rules e.g. Losing chess or Chess960 different forces e.g. Dunsany 's Chess non-standard pieces e.g. Grand Chess and different board geometries e.g. hexagonal chess or Infinite chess In the context of chess variants regular i.e. FIDE chess is commonly referred to as Western chess international chess orthodox chess orthochess and classic chess.

Sekele language,Sekele is the northern language of the ǃKung dialect continuum. It was widespread in southern Angola before the Angolan Civil War but those varieties are now spoken principally among diaspora in northern Namibia. There are also number of dialects spoken in far northern Namibia. Sekele is known by number of names. Sekele itself derives from Vasekele the Angolan Bantu name. It is also known as Northern ǃKung Northern ǃXuun and Northern Ju. Two of the Angolan varieties have gone by the outdated term ǃʼOǃKung or ǃʼO ǃuŋ ǃˀoːǃʰũ Forest ǃKung and Maligo short for Sekele Maligo.

Contents README file typically encompasses Configuration instructions Installation instructions Operating instructions file manifest list of files in the directory or archive Copyright and licensing information Contact information for the distributor or author list of known bugs Troubleshooting instructions Credits and acknowledgments changelog usually aimed at fellow programmers news section usually aimed at end users History It is unclear when the convention of including README file began but examples dating to the mid-1970s have been found. Early Macintosh system software installed Read Me on the Startup Disk and README files commonly accompanied third-party software. In particular there is long history of free software and open-source software including README file the GNU Coding Standards encourage including one to provide general overview of the package .Since the advent of the web as de facto standard platform for software distribution many software packages have moved or occasionally copied some of the above ancillary files and pieces of information to website or wiki sometimes including the README itself or sometimes leaving behind only brief README file without all of the information required by new user of the software. The popular source code hosting website GitHub strongly encourages the creation of README file if one exists in the main top-level directory of repository it is automatically presented on the repository 's front page. In addition to plain text various other formats and file extensions are also supported and HTML conversion takes extensions into account in particular README.md is treated as GitHub Flavored Markdown. As generic term The expression readme file is also sometimes used generically for other files with similar purpose. For example the source-code distributions of many free software packages especially those following the Gnits Standards or those produced with GNU Autotools include standard set of readme files Also commonly distributed with software packages are an FAQ file and TODO file which lists planned improvements.

Relational operator,In computer science relational operator is programming language construct or operator that tests or defines some kind of relation between two entities. These include numerical equality e.g. and inequalities e.g.. In programming languages that include distinct boolean data type in their type system like Pascal Ada or Java these operators usually evaluate to true or false depending on if the conditional relationship between the two operands holds or not. In languages such as relational operators return the integers or where stands for false and any non-zero value stands for true. An expression created using relational operator forms what is termed relational expression or condition.

In languages such as relational operators return the integers or where stands for false and any non-zero value stands for true. An expression created using relational operator forms what is termed relational expression or condition. Relational operators can be seen as special cases of logical predicates. Equality Usage Equality is used in many programming language constructs and data types. It is used to test if an element already exists in set or to access to value through key. It is used in switch statements to dispatch the control flow to the correct branch and during the unification process in logic programming. One possible meaning of equality is that if equals then either or can be used interchangeably in any context without noticing any difference. But this statement does not necessarily hold particularly when taking into account mutability together with content equality. Location equality vs. content equality Sometimes particularly in object-oriented programming the comparison raises questions of data types and inheritance equality and identity. It is often necessary to distinguish between two different objects of the same type e.g. two hands two objects being equal but distinct e.g. two 10 banknotes two objects being equal but having different representation e.g. bill and coin two different references to the same object e.g. two nicknames for the same personIn many modern programming languages objects and data structures are accessed through references. In such languages there becomes need to test for two different types of equality Location equality identity if two references and reference the same object. Interactions with the object through are indistinguishable from the same interactions through and in particular changes to the object through are reflected through. Content equality if the objects referenced by two references and are equivalent in some sense Structural equality that is their contents are the same. which may be either shallow testing only immediate subparts or deep testing for equality of subparts recursively. simple way to achieve this is through representational equality checking that the values have the same representation. Some other tailor-made equality preserving the external behavior. For example 1/2 and 2/4 are considered equal when seen as rational number. possible requirement would be that if and only if all operations on objects and will have the same result in addition to reflexivity symmetry and transitivity.The first type of equality usually implies the second except for things like not number NaN which are unequal to themselves but the converse is not necessarily true. For example two string objects may be distinct objects unequal in the first sense but contain the same sequence of characters equal in the second sense. See identity for more of this issue. Real numbers including many simple fractions can not be represented exactly in floating-point arithmetic and it may be necessary to test for equality within given tolerance. Such tolerance however can easily break desired properties such as transitivity whereas reflexivity breaks too the IEEE floating-point standard requires that NaN NaN holds. In contrast the 2022 private standard for posit arithmetic posit proponents mean to replace IEEE floats has similar concept NaR Not Real where NaR NaR holds.Other programming elements such as computable functions may either have no sense of equality or an equality that is uncomputable. For these reasons some languages define an explicit notion of comparable in the form of base class an interface trait or protocol which is used either explicitly by declaration in source code or implicitly via the structure of the type involved. Comparing values of different types In JavaScript PHP VBScript and few other dynamically typed languages the standard equality operator evaluates to true if two values are equal even if they have different types making the number compare equal to the text string for instance. typed equality operator is often available also in such languages returning true only for values with identical or equivalent types in PHP is false although is true. For languages where the number may be interpreted as false this operator may simplify things such as checking for zero as would be true for being either or using the type agnostic equality operator. Ordering Greater than and less than comparison of non-numeric data is performed according to sort convention such as for text strings lexicographical order which may be built into the programming language and/or configurable by programmer. When it is desired to associate numeric value with the result of comparison between two data items say and the usual convention is to assign −1 if if and if. For example the function strcmp performs three-way comparison and returns −1 or according to this convention and qsort expects the comparison function to return values according to this convention. In sorting algorithms the efficiency of comparison code is critical since it is one of the major factors contributing to sorting performance. Comparison of programmer-defined data types data types for which the programming language has no in-built understanding may be carried out by custom-written or library functions such as strcmp mentioned above or in some languages by overloading comparison operator that is assigning programmer-defined meaning that depends on the data types being compared. Another alternative is using some convention such as member-wise comparison. Logical equivalence Though perhaps unobvious at first like the boolean logical operators XOR AND OR and NOT relational operators can be designed to have logical equivalence such that they can all be defined in terms of one another. The following four conditional statements all have the same logical equivalence either all true or all false for any given and values \displaystyle E= \begin cases y\\y x\\x\ngeq y\\y\nleq x\end cases This relies on the domain being well ordered. Standard relational operators The most common numerical relational operators used in programming languages are shown below. Standard SQL uses the same operators as BASIC while many databases allow in addition to from the standard. SQL follows strict boolean algebra i.e. does n't use short-circuit evaluation which is common to most languages below. E.g. PHP has it but otherwise it has these same two operators defined as aliases like many SQL databases. Other conventions are less common Common Lisp and Macsyma/Maxima use Basic-like operators except for inequality which is /= in Common Lisp and in Macsyma/Maxima. Older Lisps used equal greaterp and lessp and negated them using not for the remaining operators. Syntax Relational operators are also used in technical literature instead of words. Relational operators are usually written in infix notation if supported by the programming language which means that they appear between their operands the two expressions being related. For example an expression in Python will print the message if the is less than Other programming languages such as Lisp use prefix notation as follows Operator chaining In mathematics it is common practice to chain relational operators such as in 20 meaning and and 20. The syntax is clear since these relational operators in mathematics are transitive. However many recent programming languages would see an expression like as consisting of two left or right- associative operators interpreting it as something like. If we say that x=4 we then get and evaluation will give true which generally does not make sense. However it does compile in C/C++ and some other languages yielding surprising result as true would be represented by the number here. It is possible to give the expression its familiar mathematical meaning and some programming languages such as Python and Raku do that. Others such as and Java do not partly because it would differ from the way most other infix operators work in C-like languages. The programming language does not do that since it maintains some compatibility with and Allowing expressions but with subtly different semantics albeit arguably in the right direction would add more confusion than convenience .Some languages like Common Lisp use multiple argument predicates for this. In Lisp 10 is true when is between and 10. Confusion with assignment operators Early FORTRAN 1956–57 was bounded by heavily restricted character sets where was the only relational operator available. There were no or and certainly no or. This forced the designers to define symbols such as .GT. .LT. .GE. .EQ. etc. and subsequently made it tempting to use the remaining character for copying despite the obvious incoherence with mathematical usage X=X+1 should be impossible. International Algebraic Language IAL ALGOL 58 and ALGOL 1958 and 1960 thus introduced for assignment leaving the standard available for equality convention followed by CPL ALGOL ALGOL 68 Basic Combined Programming Language BCPL Simula SET Language SETL Pascal Smalltalk Modula-2 Ada Standard ML OCaml Eiffel Object Pascal Delphi Oberon Dylan VHSIC Hardware Description Language VHDL and several other languages. ==== and ==== This uniform de facto standard among most programming languages was eventually changed indirectly by minimalist compiled language named. Its sole intended application was as vehicle for first port of then very primitive Unix but it also evolved into the very influential language. started off as syntactically changed variant of the systems programming language BCPL simplified and typeless version of CPL. In what has been described as strip-down process the and and or operators of BCPL were replaced with and which would later become and || respectively. In the same process the ALGOL style of BCPL was replaced by in. The reason for all this being unknown. As variable updates had no special syntax in such as let or similar and were allowed in expressions this non standard meaning of the equal sign meant that the traditional semantics of the equal sign now had to be associated with another symbol. Ken Thompson used the ad hoc combination for this. As small type system was later introduced then became C. The popularity of this language along with its association with Unix led to Java and many other languages following suit syntactically despite this needless conflict with the mathematical meaning of the equal sign. ==== Languages ==== Assignments in have value and since any non-zero scalar value is interpreted as true in conditional expressions the code if is legal but has very different meaning from if. The former code fragment means assign to and if the new value of is not zero execute the following statement. The latter fragment means if and only if is equal to execute the following statement. Though Java and have the same operators as this mistake usually causes compile error in these languages instead because the if-condition must be of type boolean and there is no implicit way to convert from other types e.g. numbers into booleans. So unless the variable that is assigned to has type boolean or wrapper type Boolean there will be compile error. In ALGOL-like languages such as Pascal Delphi and Ada in the sense that they allow nested function definitions and in Python and many functional languages among others assignment operators can not appear in an expression including if clauses thus precluding this class of error. Some compilers such as GNU Compiler Collection GCC provide warning when compiling code containing an assignment operator inside an if statement though there are some legitimate uses of an assignment inside an if-condition. In such cases the assignment must be wrapped in an extra pair of parentheses explicitly to avoid the warning. Similarly some languages such as BASIC use just the symbol for both assignment and equality as they are syntactically separate as with Pascal Ada Python etc. assignment operators can not appear in expressions. Some programmers get in the habit of writing comparisons against constant in the reverse of the usual order If is used accidentally the resulting code is invalid because is not variable. The compiler will generate an error message on which the proper operator can be substituted. This coding style is termed left-hand comparison or Yoda conditions. This table lists the different mechanisms to test for these two types of equality in various languages Ruby uses to mean is member of the set though the details of what it means to be member vary considerably depending on the data types involved. is here known as the case equality or case subsumption operator.

Background and release On April 13 2019 countdown to midnight on April 26 appeared on Taylor Swift 's website leading to speculation about the release of new music. On April 25 various news outlets reported that mural of butterfly in The Gulch neighborhood of Nashville Tennessee painted by street artist Kelsey Montague was connected with the upcoming release. crowd of several hundred gathered at the mural as the word Me. was added to it by Montague. While Montague was initially told that the mural was commissioned as promotion for ABC ESPN and the 2019 NFL Draft Swift appeared at the mural and revealed that it was in fact part of her countdown promotion and that she would be interviewed by Robin Roberts during the NFL Draft broadcast with further information. At the interview she confirmed the release of new song and music video at midnight sharing the title as well as the feature from Urie. Composition With pop song we have an ability to get melody stuck in people 's heads and just want it to be one that makes them feel better about themselves not worse. Me. is bubblegum and synth-pop song driven by marching band drumline. which was written by Swift Joel Little of Goodnight Nurse and Brendon Urie of Panic. at the Disco and produced by Swift and Little. The song was initially developed as slow acoustic piano ballad. In an interview with Robin Roberts Swift described the song as about embracing your individuality and really owning it .The song is performed in the key of major in common time with tempo of 91 beats per minute. It follows an I–vi–IV–V chord progression known as the '50s progression in major this is C–Am–F–G. The song 's vocals span from F3 to E5.On August 21 2019 it was reported that the lyric Hey kids spelling is fun. was removed from all digital and streaming versions of the song including the album version. It remains in the music video and the lyric video. Critical reception Me. received mixed reviews from music critics.

Speckter 1915 February 14 1988 conceptualized the interrobang in 1962. As the head of an advertising agency Speckter believed that advertisements would look better if copywriters conveyed surprised rhetorical questions using single mark. He proposed the concept of single punctuation mark in an article in the magazine TYPEtalks. Speckter solicited possible names for the new character from readers. Contenders included exclamaquest QuizDing rhet and exclarotive but he settled on interrobang. He chose the name to reference the punctuation marks that inspired it interrogatio is Latin for rhetorical question or cross-examination bang is printers slang for the exclamation mark.

French Revolution,"The French Revolution French Révolution française ʁevɔlysjɔ̃ fʁɑ̃sɛːz was period of radical political and societal change in France that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799.

Despite series of military victories many won by Napoleon Bonaparte political divisions and economic stagnation resulted in the Directory being replaced by the Consulate in November 1799. This is generally seen as marking the end of the Revolutionary period. Causes The underlying causes of the French Revolution are usually attributed to the Ancien Régime 's failure to manage social and economic inequality. Rapid population growth and the inability to adequately finance government debt resulted in economic depression unemployment and high food prices. Combined with regressive tax system and resistance to reform by the ruling elite it resulted in crisis Louis XVI proved unable to manage.At the same time discussion of these issues and political dissent had become part of wider European society rather than confined to small elite. This took different forms such as 'English coffeehouse culture and extended to areas colonised by Europeans particularly British North America. Contacts between diverse groups in Edinburgh Geneva Boston Amsterdam Paris London or Vienna were much greater than often appreciated.Transnational elites who shared ideas and styles were not new what changed was their extent and the numbers involved. Under King Louis XIV the court at Versailles was the centre of culture fashion and political power. Improvements in education and literacy over the course of the 18th century meant larger audiences for newspapers and journals with Masonic lodges coffee houses and reading clubs providing areas where people could debate and discuss ideas. The emergence of this public sphere led to Paris replacing Versailles as the cultural and intellectual centre leaving the Court isolated and less able to influence opinion.In addition to these social changes the French population grew from 18 million in 1700 to 26 million in 1789 making it the most populous state in Europe Paris had over 600,000 inhabitants of whom roughly one third were either unemployed or had no regular work. Inefficient agricultural methods meant domestic farmers struggled to grow enough food to support these numbers and primitive transportation networks made it hard to distribute what they did produce. As consequence of this imbalance food prices rose by 65 between 1770 and 1790 but wages increased by only 22. Such shortages were damaging for the regime since many blamed price increases on government failure to prevent profiteering. Poor harvests throughout the 1780s culminating in the most severe winter for decades in 1788/1789 created rural peasantry with nothing to sell and an urban proletariat whose purchasing power had collapsed.The other major drag on the economy was state debt. Traditional views of the French Revolution often attribute the financial crisis to the costs of the 1778–1783 Anglo-French War but modern economic studies show this is only partial explanation. In 1788 the ratio of debt to gross national income in France was 55.6 compared to 181.8 in Britain and although French borrowing costs were higher the percentage of revenue devoted to interest payments was roughly the same in both countries. One historian concludes neither the level of French state debt in 1788 or its previous history can be considered an explanation for the outbreak of revolution in 1789 .The problem lay in the assessment and collection of the taxes used to fund government expenditure. Rates varied widely from one region to another often bore little or no relation to the amounts set out in official decrees and were collected inconsistently. It was the complexity as much as the financial burden that caused resentment complaints from the nobility were not affected by paying significantly less than other classes. Attempts to make the system more transparent were blocked by the regional Parlements which controlled financial policy. The resulting impasse in the face of widespread economic distress led to the calling of the Estates-General which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances.Although not indifferent to the crisis and willing to consider reforms Louis XVI often backed down when faced with opposition from conservative elements within the nobility. As result the court became the target of popular anger particularly Queen Marie-Antoinette who was viewed as spendthrift Austrian spy and blamed for the dismissal of 'progressive ministers like Jacques Necker. For their opponents Enlightenment ideas on equality and democracy provided an intellectual framework for dealing with these issues while the American Revolution was seen as confirmation of their practical application. Crisis of the Ancien Régime Financial crisis The French state faced series of budgetary crises during the 18th century caused primarily by structural deficiencies rather than lack of resources. Unlike Britain where Parliament determined both expenditures and taxes in France the Crown controlled spending but not revenue. National taxes could only be approved by the Estates-General which had not sat since 1614 its revenue functions had been assumed by regional parlements the most powerful being the Parlement de Paris see Map .Although willing to authorise one-time taxes these bodies were reluctant to pass long-term measures while collection was outsourced to private individuals. This significantly reduced the yield from those that were approved and as result France struggled to service its debt despite being larger and wealthier than Britain. Following partial default in 1770 within five years the budget had been balanced thanks to reforms instituted by Turgot the Controller-General of Finances. This reduced government borrowing costs from 12 per year to under but he was dismissed in May 1776 after arguing France could not afford to intervene in the American Revolutionary War.Two ministers followed in quick succession before the Swiss banker Necker took over in July 1777. He was able to fund the war through loans rather than taxes but his dire warnings about the impact on national finances led to his replacement in 1781 by Charles Alexandre de Calonne. Continued French intervention in America and the associated 1778 to 1783 Anglo-French War could only be funded by issuing substantial quantities of new state debt. This created large rentier class who lived on the interest primarily members of the French nobility or commercial classes. By 1785 the government was struggling to cover these payments since defaulting on the debt would negatively impact much of French society the only other option was to increase taxes. When the parlements refused to collect them Calonne persuaded Louis to summon the Assembly of Notables an advisory council dominated by the upper nobility. Led by de Brienne former archbishop of Toulouse the council also refused to approve new taxes arguing this could only be done by the Estates.By 1788 total state debt had increased to an unprecedented 4.5 billion livres. De Brienne who succeeded Calonne in May 1787 tried to address the budgetary impasse without raising taxes by devaluing the coinage instead the result was runaway inflation worsening the plight of the farmers and urban poor. In last attempt to resolve the crisis Necker returned as Finance Minister in August 1788 but was unable to reach an agreement on how to increase revenue. In May 1789 Louis summoned the Estates-General for the first time in over hundred and fifty years. Estates-General of 1789 The Estates-General was divided into three parts the First for members of the clergy Second for the nobility and Third for the commons. Each sat separately enabling the First and Second Estates to outvote the Third despite representing less than of the population while both were largely exempt from tax.In the 1789 elections the First Estate returned 303 deputies representing 100,000 Catholic clergy nearly 10 of French lands were owned directly by individual bishops and monasteries in addition to tithes paid by peasants. More than two-thirds of the clergy lived on less than 500 livres per year and were often closer to the urban and rural poor than those elected for the Third Estate where voting was restricted to male French taxpayers aged 25 or over. As result half of the 610 deputies elected to the Third Estate in 1789 were lawyers or local officials nearly third businessmen while fifty-one were wealthy land owners.The Second Estate elected 291 deputies representing about 400,000 men and women who owned about 25 of the land and collected seigneurial dues and rents from their tenants. Like the clergy this was not uniform body and was divided into the noblesse d'épée or traditional aristocracy and the noblesse de robe. The latter derived rank from judicial or administrative posts and tended to be hard-working professionals who dominated the regional parlements and were often intensely socially conservative.To assist delegates each region completed list of grievances known as Cahiers de doléances. Although they contained ideas that would have seemed radical only months before most supported the monarchy and assumed the Estates-General would agree to financial reforms rather than fundamental constitutional change. The lifting of press censorship allowed widespread distribution of political writings mostly written by liberal members of the aristocracy and upper middle-class. Abbé Sieyès political theorist and priest elected to the Third Estate argued it should take precedence over the other two as it represented 95 of the population.The Estates-General convened in the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi on May 1789 near the Palace of Versailles rather than in Paris the choice of location was interpreted as an attempt to control their debates. As was customary each Estate assembled in separate rooms whose furnishings and opening ceremonies deliberately emphasised the superiority of the First and Second Estates. They also insisted on enforcing the rule that only those who owned land could sit as deputies for the Second Estate and thus excluded the immensely popular Comte de Mirabeau. As separate assemblies meant the Third Estate could always be outvoted by the other two Sieyès sought to combine all three. His method was to require all deputies be approved by the Estates-General as whole instead of each Estate verifying its own members. Since this meant the legitimacy of deputies derived from the Estates-General they would have to continue sitting as one body. After an extended stalemate on 10 June the Third Estate proceeded to verify its own deputies process completed on 17 June two days later they were joined by over 100 members of the First Estate and declared themselves the National Assembly. The remaining deputies from the other two Estates were invited to join but the Assembly made it clear they intended to legislate with or without their support.In an attempt to prevent the Assembly from convening Louis XVI ordered the Salle des États closed down claiming it needed to be prepared for royal speech. On 20 June the Assembly met in tennis court outside Versailles and swore not to disperse until new constitution had been agreed. Messages of support poured in from Paris and other cities by 27 June they had been joined by the majority of the First Estate plus forty-seven members of the Second and Louis backed down. Constitutional monarchy July 1789 September 1792 Abolition of the Ancien Régime Even these limited reforms went too far for Marie Antoinette and Louis younger brother the Comte d'Artois on their advice Louis dismissed Necker again as chief minister on 11 July. On 12 July the Assembly went into non-stop session after rumours circulated he was planning to use the Swiss Guards to force it to close. The news brought crowds of protestors into the streets and soldiers of the elite Gardes Françaises regiment refused to disperse them.On the 14th many of these soldiers joined the mob in attacking the Bastille royal fortress with large stores of arms and ammunition. Its governor Bernard-René de Launay surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers. Taken to the Hôtel de Ville he was executed his head placed on pike and paraded around the city the fortress was then torn down in remarkably short time. Although rumoured to hold many prisoners the Bastille held only seven four forgers two noblemen held for immoral behaviour and murder suspect. Nevertheless as potent symbol of the Ancien Régime its destruction was viewed as triumph and Bastille Day is still celebrated every year. In French culture some see its fall as the start of the Revolution. Alarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital Louis appointed the Marquis de Lafayette commander of the National Guard with Jean-Sylvain Bailly as head of new administrative structure known as the Commune. On 17 July Louis visited Paris accompanied by 100 deputies where he was greeted by Bailly and accepted tricolore cockade to loud cheers. However it was clear power had shifted from his court he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI father of the French and king of free people. 'The short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by common threat quickly dissipated. Deputies argued over constitutional forms while civil authority rapidly deteriorated. On 22 July former Finance Minister Joseph Foullon and his son were lynched by Parisian mob and neither Bailly nor Lafayette could prevent it. In rural areas wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as la Grande Peur. The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad. These émigrés funded reactionary forces within France and urged foreign monarchs to back counter-revolution.In response the Assembly published the August Decrees which abolished feudalism and other privileges held by the nobility notably exemption from tax. Other decrees included equality before the law opening public office to all freedom of worship and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns. Over 25 of French farmland was subject to feudal dues which provided most of the income for large landowners these were now cancelled along with tithes due to the church. The intention was for tenants to pay compensation for these losses but the majority refused to comply and the obligation was cancelled in 1793.With the suspension of the 13 regional parlements in November the key institutional pillars of the old regime had all been abolished in less than four months. From its early stages the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications. Creating new constitution Assisted by Thomas Jefferson then the minister to France Lafayette prepared draft constitution known as the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen which echoed some of the provisions of the Declaration of Independence. However France had reached no consensus on the role of the Crown and until this question was settled it was impossible to create political institutions. When presented to the legislative committee on 11 July it was rejected by pragmatists such as Jean Joseph Mounier President of the Assembly who feared creating expectations that could not be satisfied. After editing by Mirabeau it was published on 26 August as statement of principle. It contained provisions considered radical in any European society let alone 1789 France and while historians continue to debate responsibility for its wording most agree the reality is mix. Although Jefferson made major contributions to Lafayette 's draft he himself acknowledged an intellectual debt to Montesquieu and the final version was significantly different. French historian Georges Lefebvre argues that combined with the elimination of privilege and feudalism it highlighted equality in way the American Declaration of Independence did not .More importantly the two differed in intent Jefferson saw the US Constitution and Bill of Rights as fixing the political system at specific point in time claiming they 'contained no original thought ... but expressed the American mind at that stage. The 1791 French Constitution was viewed as starting point the Declaration providing an aspirational vision key difference between the two Revolutions. Attached as preamble to the French Constitution of 1791 and that of the 1870 to 1940 French Third Republic it was incorporated into the current Constitution of France in 1958.Discussions continued. Mounier supported by conservatives like Gérard de Lally-Tollendal wanted bicameral system with an upper house appointed by the king who would have the right of veto. On 10 September the majority led by Sieyès and Talleyrand rejected this in favour of single assembly while Louis retained only suspensive veto this meant he could delay the implementation of law but not block it. On this basis new committee was convened to agree on constitution the most controversial issue was citizenship linked to the debate on the balance between individual rights and obligations. Ultimately the 1791 Constitution distinguished between 'active citizens who held political rights defined as French males over the age of 25 who paid direct taxes equal to three days labour and 'passive citizens who were restricted to 'civil rights. As result it was never fully accepted by radicals in the Jacobin club.Food shortages and the worsening economy caused frustration at the lack of progress and the Parisian working-class or sans culottes became increasingly restive. This came to head in late September when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to reinforce the Royal Bodyguard and in line with normal practice were welcomed with formal banquet. Popular anger was fuelled by press descriptions of this as 'gluttonous orgy and claims that the tricolor cockade had been abused. The arrival of these troops was also viewed as an attempt to intimidate the Assembly.On October 1789 crowds of women assembled outside the Hôtel de Ville urging action to reduce prices and improve bread supplies. These protests quickly turned political and after seizing weapons stored at the Hôtel de Ville some 7,000 marched on Versailles where they entered the Assembly to present their demands. They were followed by 15,000 members of the National Guard under Lafayette who tried to dissuade them but took command when it became clear they would desert if he did not grant their request.When the National Guard arrived later that evening Lafayette persuaded Louis that the safety of his family required their relocation to Paris. Next morning some of the protestors broke into the Royal apartments searching for Marie Antoinette who escaped. They ransacked the palace killing several guards. Although the situation remained tense order was eventually restored and the Royal family and Assembly left for Paris escorted by the National Guard. Announcing his acceptance of the August Decrees and the Declaration Louis committed to constitutional monarchy and his official title changed from 'King of France to 'King of the French. Revolution and the church Historian John McManners argues in eighteenth-century France throne and altar were commonly spoken of as in close alliance their simultaneous collapse ... would one day provide the final proof of their interdependence. One suggestion is that after century of persecution some French Protestants actively supported an anti-Catholic regime resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire. Jean-Jacques Rousseau considered philosophical founder of the revolution wrote it was manifestly contrary to the law of nature ... that handful of people should gorge themselves with superfluities while the hungry multitude goes in want of necessities. The Revolution caused massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state although the extent of religious belief has been questioned elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic. The church was the largest individual landowner in France controlling nearly 10 of all estates and levied tithes effectively 10 tax on income collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops. In return it provided minimal level of social support.The August decrees abolished tithes and on November the Assembly confiscated all church property the value of which was used to back new paper currency known as assignats. In return the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor the sick and the orphaned. On 13 February 1790 religious orders and monasteries were dissolved while monks and nuns were encouraged to return to private life.The Civil Constitution of the Clergy of 12 July 1790 made them employees of the state as well as establishing rates of pay and system for electing priests and bishops. Pope Pius VI and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the Pope over the French Church. In October thirty bishops wrote declaration denouncing the law further fuelling opposition.When clergy were required to swear loyalty to the Civil Constitution in November 1790 it split the church between the 24 who complied and the majority who refused. This stiffened popular resistance against state interference especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy Brittany and the Vendée where only few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution. The result was state-led persecution of Refractory clergy many of whom were forced into exile deported or executed. Political divisions The period from October 1789 to spring 1791 is usually seen as one of relative tranquility when some of the most important legislative reforms were enacted. While certainly true many provincial areas experienced conflict over the source of legitimate authority where officers of the Ancien Régime had been swept away but new structures were not yet in place. This was less obvious in Paris since the formation of the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe but growing disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly. Centrists led by Sieyès Lafayette Mirabeau and Bailly created majority by forging consensus with monarchiens like Mounier and independents including Adrien Duport Barnave and Alexandre Lameth. At one end of the political spectrum reactionaries like Cazalès and Maury denounced the Revolution in all its forms with extremists like Maximilien Robespierre at the other. He and Jean-Paul Marat gained increasing support for opposing the criteria for 'active citizens which had disenfranchised much of the Parisian proletariat. In January 1790 the National Guard tried to arrest Marat for denouncing Lafayette and Bailly as 'enemies of the people'.On 14 July 1790 celebrations were held throughout France commemorating the fall of the Bastille with participants swearing an oath of fidelity to 'the nation the law and the king. The Fête de la Fédération in Paris was attended by Louis XVI and his family with Talleyrand performing mass. Despite this show of unity the Assembly was increasingly divided while external players like the Paris Commune and National Guard competed for power. One of the most significant was the Jacobin club originally forum for general debate by August 1790 it had over 150 members split into different factions.The Assembly continued to develop new institutions in September 1790 the regional Parlements were abolished and their legal functions replaced by new independent judiciary with jury trials for criminal cases. However moderate deputies were uneasy at popular demands for universal suffrage labour unions and cheap bread and over the winter of 1790 and 1791 they passed series of measures intended to disarm popular radicalism. These included exclusion of poorer citizens from the National Guard limits on use of petitions and posters and the June 1791 Le Chapelier Law suppressing trade guilds and any form of worker organisation.The traditional force for preserving law and order was the army which was increasingly divided between officers who largely came from the nobility and ordinary soldiers. In August 1790 the loyalist General Bouillé suppressed serious mutiny at Nancy although congratulated by the Assembly he was criticised by Jacobin radicals for the severity of his actions. Growing disorder meant many professional officers either left or became émigrés further destabilising the institution. Varennes and after Held in the Tuileries Palace under virtual house arrest Louis XVI was urged by his brother and wife to re-assert his independence by taking refuge with Bouillé who was based at Montmédy with 10,000 soldiers considered loyal to the Crown. The royal family left the palace in disguise on the night of 20 June 1791 late the next day Louis was recognised as he passed through Varennes arrested and taken back to Paris. The attempted escape had profound impact on public opinion since it was clear Louis had been seeking refuge in Austria the Assembly now demanded oaths of loyalty to the regime and began preparing for war while fear of 'spies and traitors became pervasive. Despite calls to replace the monarchy with republic Louis retained his position but was generally regarded with acute suspicion and forced to swear allegiance to the constitution. new decree stated retracting this oath making war upon the nation or permitting anyone to do so in his name would be considered abdication. However radicals led by Jacques Pierre Brissot prepared petition demanding his deposition and on 17 July an immense crowd gathered in the Champ de Mars to sign. Led by Lafayette the National Guard was ordered to preserve public order and responded to barrage of stones by firing into the crowd killing between 13 and 50 people.The massacre badly damaged Lafayette 's reputation the authorities responded by closing radical clubs and newspapers while their leaders went into exile or hiding including Marat. On 27 August Emperor Leopold II and King Frederick William II of Prussia issued the Declaration of Pillnitz declaring their support for Louis and hinting at an invasion of France on his behalf. In reality the meeting between Leopold and Frederick was primarily to discuss the Partitions of Poland the Declaration was intended to satisfy Comte d'Artois and other French émigrés but the threat rallied popular support behind the regime.Based on motion proposed by Robespierre existing deputies were barred from elections held in early September for the French Legislative Assembly. Although Robespierre himself was one of those excluded his support in the clubs gave him political power base not available to Lafayette and Bailly who resigned respectively as head of the National Guard and the Paris Commune. The new laws were gathered together in the 1791 Constitution and submitted to Louis XVI who pledged to defend it from enemies at home and abroad. On 30 September the Constituent Assembly was dissolved and the Legislative Assembly convened the next day. Fall of the monarchy The Legislative Assembly is often dismissed by historians as an ineffective body compromised by divisions over the role of the monarchy which were exacerbated by Louis resistance to limitations on his powers and attempts to reverse them using external support. Restricting the franchise to those who paid minimum amount of tax meant only out of million Frenchmen over 25 were able to vote it largely excluded the sans culottes or urban working class who increasingly saw the new regime as failing to meet their demands for bread and work.This meant the new constitution was opposed by significant elements inside and outside the Assembly itself split into three main groups. 245 members were affiliated with Barnave 's Feuillants constitutional monarchists who considered the Revolution had gone far enough while another 136 were Jacobin leftists who supported republic led by Brissot and usually referred to as Brissotins. The remaining 345 belonged to La Plaine central faction who switched votes depending on the issue many of whom shared Brissotins suspicions as to Louis commitment to the Revolution. After Louis officially accepted the new Constitution one response was recorded as being Vive le roi s'il est de bon foi. or Long live the king if he keeps his word .Although minority the Brissotins control of key committees allowed them to focus on two issues both intended to portray Louis as hostile to the Revolution by provoking him into using his veto. The first concerned émigrés between October and November the Assembly approved measures confiscating their property and threatening them with the death penalty. The second was non-juring priests whose opposition to the Civil Constitution led to state of near civil war in southern France which Bernave tried to defuse by relaxing the more punitive provisions. On 29 November the Assembly passed decree giving refractory clergy eight days to comply or face charges of 'conspiracy against the nation which even Robespierre viewed as too far too soon. As expected and indeed intended by their authors both were vetoed by Louis who was now portrayed as opposed to reform in general. Accompanying this was campaign for war against Austria and Prussia also led by Brissot whose aims have been interpreted as mixture of cynical calculation and revolutionary idealism. While exploiting popular anti-Austrianism it reflected genuine belief in exporting the values of political liberty and popular sovereignty. Ironically Marie Antoinette headed faction within the court that also favoured war seeing it as way to win control of the military and restore royal authority. In December 1791 Louis made speech in the Assembly giving foreign powers month to disband the émigrés or face war which was greeted with enthusiasm by supporters and suspicion from opponents.Bernave 's inability to build consensus in the Assembly resulted in the appointment of new government chiefly composed of Brissotins. On 20 April 1792 the French Revolutionary Wars began when French armies attacked Austrian and Prussian forces along their borders before suffering series of disastrous defeats. In an effort to mobilise popular support the government ordered non-juring priests to swear the oath or be deported dissolved the Constitutional Guard and replaced it with 20,000 fédérés Louis agreed to disband the Guard but vetoed the other two proposals while Lafayette called on the Assembly to suppress the clubs.Popular anger increased when details of the Brunswick Manifesto reached Paris on August threatening 'unforgettable vengeance should any oppose the Allies in seeking to restore the power of the monarchy. On the morning of 10 August combined force of the Paris National Guard and provincial fédérés attacked the Tuileries Palace killing many of the Swiss Guards protecting it. Louis and his family took refuge with the Assembly and shortly after 11:00 am the deputies present voted to 'temporarily relieve the king effectively suspending the monarchy. First Republic 1792–1795 Proclamation of the First Republic In late August elections were held for the National Convention voter restrictions meant those cast fell to 3.3 million versus million in 1791 while intimidation was widespread. The former Brissotins now split into moderate Girondins led by Brissot and radical Montagnards headed by Maximilien Robespierre Georges Danton and Jean-Paul Marat. While loyalties constantly shifted around 160 of the 749 deputies were Girondists 200 Montagnards and 389 members of La Plaine. Led by Bertrand Barère Pierre Joseph Cambon and Lazare Carnot as before this central faction acted as swing vote.In the September Massacres between 1,100 and 1,600 prisoners held in Parisian jails were summarily executed the vast majority of whom were common criminals. response to the capture of Longwy and Verdun by Prussia the perpetrators were largely National Guard members and fédérés on their way to the front. Responsibility is disputed but even moderates expressed sympathy for the action which soon spread to the provinces the killings reflected widespread concern over social disorder On 20 September the French army won stunning victory over the Prussians at Valmy. Emboldened by this on 22 September the Convention replaced the monarchy with the French First Republic and introduced new calendar with 1792 becoming Year One. The next few months were taken up with the trial of Citoyen Louis Capet formerly Louis XVI. While the convention was evenly divided on the question of his guilt members were increasingly influenced by radicals centred in the Jacobin clubs and Paris Commune. The Brunswick Manifesto made it easy to portray Louis as threat to the Revolution apparently confirmed when extracts from his personal correspondence were published showed him conspiring with Royalist exiles serving in the Prussian and Austrian armies.On 17 January 1793 the Assembly condemned Louis to death for conspiracy against public liberty and general safety by 361 to 288 another 72 members voted to execute him subject to variety of delaying conditions. The sentence was carried out on 21 January on the Place de la Révolution now the Place de la Concorde. Horrified conservatives across Europe called for the destruction of revolutionary France in February the Convention anticipated this by declaring war on Britain and the Dutch Republic these countries were later joined by Spain Portugal Naples and the Tuscany in the War of the First Coalition. Political crisis and fall of the Girondins The Girondins hoped war would unite the people behind the government and provide an excuse for rising prices and food shortages but found themselves the target of popular anger. Many left for the provinces. The first conscription measure or levée en masse on 24 February sparked riots in Paris and other regional centres. Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church in March the traditionally conservative and royalist Vendée rose in revolt. On 18th Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and defected to the Austrians. Uprisings followed in Bordeaux Lyon Toulon Marseilles and Caen. The Republic seemed on the verge of collapse.The crisis led to the creation on April 1793 of the Committee of Public Safety an executive committee accountable to the convention. The Girondins made fatal political error by indicting Marat before the Revolutionary Tribunal for allegedly directing the September massacres he was quickly acquitted further isolating the Girondins from the sans-culottes. When Jacques Hébert called for popular revolt against the henchmen of Louis Capet on 24 May he was arrested by the Commission of Twelve Girondin-dominated tribunal set up to expose 'plots. In response to protests by the Commune the Commission warned if by your incessant rebellions something befalls the representatives of the nation ... Paris will be obliterated. Growing discontent allowed the clubs to mobilise against the Girondins. Backed by the Commune and elements of the National Guard on 31 May they attempted to seize power in coup. Although the coup failed on June the convention was surrounded by crowd of up to 80,000 demanding cheap bread unemployment pay and political reforms including restriction of the vote to the sans-culottes and the right to remove deputies at will. Ten members of the commission and another twenty-nine members of the Girondin faction were arrested and on 10 June the Montagnards took over the Committee of Public Safety.Meanwhile committee led by Robespierre 's close ally Saint-Just was tasked with preparing new Constitution. Completed in only eight days it was ratified by the convention on 24 June and contained radical reforms including universal male suffrage and abolition of slavery in French colonies. However normal legal processes were suspended following the assassination of Marat on 13 July by the Girondist Charlotte Corday which the Committee of Public Safety used as an excuse to take control. The 1793 Constitution was suspended indefinitely in October.Key areas of focus for the new government included creating new state ideology economic regulation and winning the war. They were helped by divisions among their internal opponents while areas like the Vendée and Brittany wanted to restore the monarchy most supported the Republic but opposed the regime in Paris. On 17 August the Convention voted second levée en masse despite initial problems in equipping and supplying such large numbers by mid-October Republican forces had re-taken Lyon Marseilles and Bordeaux while defeating Coalition armies at Hondschoote and Wattignies. The new class of military leaders included young colonel named Napoleon Bonaparte who was appointed commander of artillery at the siege of Toulon thanks to his friendship with Augustin Robespierre. His success in that role resulted in promotion to the Army of Italy in April 1794 and the beginning of his rise to military and political power. Reign of Terror The Reign of Terror began as way to harness revolutionary fervour but quickly degenerated into the settlement of personal grievances. At the end of July the Convention set price controls over wide range of goods with the death penalty for hoarders and on September 'revolutionary groups were established to enforce them. On 17th the Law of Suspects ordered the arrest of suspected enemies of freedom initiating what became known as the Terror. According to archival records from September 1793 to July 1794 some 16,600 people were executed on charges of counter-revolutionary activity another 40,000 may have been summarily executed or died awaiting trial.Fixed prices death for 'hoarders or 'profiteers and confiscation of grain stocks by groups of armed workers meant that by early September Paris was suffering acute food shortages. However France 's biggest challenge was servicing the huge public debt inherited from the former regime which continued to expand due to the war. Initially the debt was financed by sales of confiscated property but this was hugely inefficient since few would buy assets that might be repossessed fiscal stability could only be achieved by continuing the war until French counter-revolutionaries had been defeated. As internal and external threats to the Republic increased the position worsened dealing with this by printing assignats led to inflation and higher prices.On 10 October the Convention recognised the Committee of Public Safety as the supreme Revolutionary Government and suspended the Constitution until peace was achieved. In mid-October Marie Antoinette was found guilty of long list of crimes and guillotined two weeks later the Girondist leaders arrested in June were also executed along with Philippe Égalité. Terror was not confined to Paris over 2,000 were killed after the recapture of Lyons. At Cholet on 17 October the Republican army won decisive victory over the Vendée rebels and the survivors escaped into Brittany. Another defeat at Le Mans on 23 December ended the rebellion as major threat although the insurgency continued until 1796. The extent of the brutal repression that followed has been debated by French historians since the mid-19th century. Between November 1793 to February 1794 over 4,000 were drowned in the Loire at Nantes under the supervision of Jean-Baptiste Carrier. Historian Reynald Secher claims that as many as 117,000 died between 1793 and 1796. Although those numbers have been challenged François Furet concluded it not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale but zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the region 's identity. At the height of the Terror the slightest hint of counter-revolutionary thought could place one under suspicion and even its supporters were not immune. Under the pressure of events splits appeared within the Montagnard faction with violent disagreements between radical Hébertists and moderates led by Danton. Robespierre saw their dispute as de-stabilising the regime and as deist he objected to the anti-religious policies advocated by the atheist Hébert who was arrested and executed on 24 March with 19 of his colleagues including Carrier. To retain the loyalty of the remaining Hébertists Danton was arrested and executed on April with Camille Desmoulins after show trial that arguably did more damage to Robespierre than any other act in this period.The Law of 22 Prairial 10 June denied enemies of the people the right to defend themselves. Those arrested in the provinces were now sent to Paris for judgement from March to July executions in Paris increased from five to twenty-six day. Many Jacobins ridiculed the festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being on June lavish and expensive ceremony led by Robespierre who was also accused of circulating claims he was second Messiah. Relaxation of price controls and rampant inflation caused increasing unrest among the sans-culottes but the improved military situation reduced fears the Republic was in danger. Many feared their own survival depended on Robespierre 's removal during meeting on 29 June three members of the Committee of Public Safety called him dictator in his face. Robespierre responded by not attending sessions allowing his opponents to build coalition against him. In speech made to the convention on 26 July he claimed certain members were conspiring against the Republic an almost certain death sentence if confirmed. When he refused to give names the session broke up in confusion. That evening he made the same speech at the Jacobins club where it was greeted with huge applause and demands for execution of the 'traitors. It was clear if his opponents did not act he would in the Convention next day Robespierre and his allies were shouted down. His voice failed when he tried to speak deputy crying The blood of Danton chokes him. After the Convention authorised his arrest he and his supporters took refuge in the Hotel de Ville which was defended by elements of the National Guard. Other units loyal to the Convention stormed the building that evening and detained Robespierre who severely injured himself attempting suicide. He was executed on 28 July with 19 colleagues including Saint-Just and Georges Couthon followed by 83 members of the Commune. The Law of 22 Prairial was repealed any surviving Girondists reinstated as deputies and the Jacobin Club was closed and banned.There are various interpretations of the Terror and the violence with which it was conducted Marxist historian Albert Soboul saw it as essential to defend the Revolution from external and internal threats. François Furet argues the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries and their utopian goals required the extermination of any opposition. middle position suggests violence was not inevitable but the product of series of complex internal events exacerbated by war. Thermidorian reaction The bloodshed did not end with the death of Robespierre Southern France saw wave of revenge killings directed against alleged Jacobins Republican officials and Protestants. Although the victors of Thermidor asserted control over the Commune by executing their leaders some of those closely involved in the Terror retained their positions. They included Paul Barras later chief executive of the French Directory and Joseph Fouché director of the killings in Lyon who served as Minister of Police under the Directory the Consulate and Empire. Despite his links to Augustin Robespierre military success in Italy meant Napoleon Bonaparte escaped censure. The December 1794 Treaty of La Jaunaye ended the Chouannerie in western France by allowing freedom of worship and the return of non-juring priests. This was accompanied by military success in January 1795 French forces helped the Dutch Patriots set up the Batavian Republic securing their northern border. The war with Prussia was concluded in favour of France by the Peace of Basel in April 1795 while Spain made peace shortly thereafter.However the Republic still faced crisis at home. Food shortages arising from poor 1794 harvest were exacerbated in Northern France by the need to supply the army in Flanders while the winter was the worst since 1709. By April 1795 people were starving and the assignat was worth only of its face value in desperation the Parisian poor rose again. They were quickly dispersed and the main impact was another round of arrests while Jacobin prisoners in Lyon were summarily executed.A committee drafted new constitution approved by plebiscite on 23 September 1795 and put into place on 27th. Largely designed by Pierre Daunou and Boissy d'Anglas it established bicameral legislature intended to slow down the legislative process ending the wild swings of policy under the previous unicameral systems. The Council of 500 was responsible for drafting legislation which was reviewed and approved by the Council of Ancients an upper house containing 250 men over the age of 40. Executive power was in the hands of five Directors selected by the Council of Ancients from list provided by the lower house with five-year mandate.Deputies were chosen by indirect election total franchise of around million voting in primaries for 30,000 electors or 0.6 of the population. Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification it guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies. In addition rather than dissolving the previous legislature as in 1791 and 1792 the so-called 'law of two-thirds ruled only 150 new deputies would be elected each year. The remaining 600 Conventionnels kept their seats move intended to ensure stability. Directory 1795–1799 The Directory has poor reputation amongst historians for Jacobin sympathisers it represented the betrayal of the Revolution while Bonapartists emphasised its corruption to portray Napoleon in better light. Although these criticisms were certainly valid it also faced internal unrest stagnating economy and an expensive war while hampered by the impracticality of the constitution. Since the Council of 500 controlled legislation and finance they could paralyse government at will and as the Directors had no power to call new elections the only way to break deadlock was to rule by decree or use force. As result the Directory was characterised by chronic violence ambivalent forms of justice and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression. Retention of the Conventionnels ensured the Thermidorians held majority in the legislature and three of the five Directors but they faced an increasing challenge from the right. On October Convention troops led by Napoleon put down royalist rising in Paris when the first elections were held two weeks later over 100 of the 150 new deputies were royalists of some sort. The power of the Parisian sans culottes had been broken by the suppression of the May 1795 revolt relieved of pressure from below the Jacobins became natural supporters of the Directory against those seeking to restore the monarchy.Removal of price controls and collapse in the value of the assignat led to inflation and soaring food prices. By April 1796 over 500,000 Parisians were reportedly in need of relief resulting in the May insurrection known as the Conspiracy of the Equals. Led by the revolutionary François-Noël Babeuf their demands included the implementation of the 1793 Constitution and more equitable distribution of wealth. Despite limited support from sections of the military it was easily crushed with Babeuf and other leaders executed. Nevertheless by 1799 the economy had been stabilised and important reforms made allowing steady expansion of French industry many remained in place for much of the 19th century.Prior to 1797 three of the five Directors were firmly Republican Barras Révellière-Lépeaux and Jean-François Rewbell as were around 40 of the legislature. The same percentage were broadly centrist or unaffiliated along with two Directors Étienne-François Letourneur and Lazare Carnot. Although only 20 were committed Royalists many centrists supported the restoration of the exiled Louis XVIII of France in the belief this would end the War of the First Coalition with Britain and Austria. The elections of May 1797 resulted in significant gains for the right with Royalists Jean-Charles Pichegru elected President of the Council of 500 and Barthélemy appointed Director. With Royalists apparently on the verge of power the Republicans staged coup on September. Using troops from Bonaparte 's Army of Italy under Pierre Augereau the Council of 500 was forced to approve the arrest of Barthélemy Pichegru and Carnot. The election results were cancelled sixty-three leading royalists deported to French Guiana and new laws passed against émigrés Royalists and ultra-Jacobins. Although the power of the monarchists had been destroyed it opened the way for direct conflict between Barras and his opponents on the left.Despite general war weariness fighting continued and the 1798 elections saw resurgence in Jacobin strength. The invasion of Egypt in July 1798 confirmed European fears of French expansionism and the War of the Second Coalition began in November. Without majority in the legislature the Directors relied on the army to enforcing decrees and extract revenue from conquered territories. This made generals like Bonaparte and Joubert essential political players while both the army and the Directory became notorious for their corruption.It has been suggested the Directory did not collapse for economic or military reasons but because by 1799 many 'preferred the uncertainties of authoritarian rule to the continuing ambiguities of parliamentary politics. The architect of its end was Sieyès who when asked what he had done during the Terror allegedly answered survived. Nominated to the Directory his first action was removing Barras using coalition that included Talleyrand and former Jacobin Lucien Bonaparte Napoleon 's brother and president of the Council of 500. On November 1799 the Coup of 18 Brumaire replaced the five Directors with the French Consulate which consisted of three members Bonaparte Sieyès and Roger Ducos most historians consider this the end point of the French Revolution. Jacobin ideology Some historians such as François Furet in Interpreting the French Revolution and Marisa Linton in Choosing Terror have evoked Jacobin ideology without however defining it. Topics related to this ideology such as slavery and imperialism are ignored in these two works. The Kingdom of France was an empire and the existence of this empire was never questioned by the revolutionaries who even maintained slavery for long time. It was not until February 1794 that they passed decree to put an end to it. By then slavery had already been abolished in the most important of the colonies Saint-Domingue following the great slave revolt that began in August 1791.With the revolution the king had ceased to be the sovereign of the empire. The new sovereign was now the people. The revolutionaries however had recognized the existence of only one people the French people while there were several nations in the empire. Recognizing other peoples would have meant having to recognize their own sovereignty and thus their right to independence. Despite their propaganda for freedom revolutionaries never recognized this right or even the right to autonomy. In the trial of the Girondins one of the main charges against them was their supposed federalism considered by the Jacobins as crime. Hostile to the federalist system the right to autonomy and the right to independence for the peoples of the empire the Jacobins conceived power only concentrated in Paris. On 25 September 1792 Lasource of Brissot 's party told the convention fear the despotism of Paris and do not want those who dispose there of the opinion of the men they mislead to dominate the national convention and the whole France. Tocqueville emphasized in L'Ancien Régime et la Révolution the immense central power created by the revolutionaries and which Mirabeau had early rejoiced. Tallien in August 1794 to explain the appearance of the regime of terror said that it presumed power that was at once arbitrary absolute and endless The system of terror presupposes not only ... arbitrary and absolute power but also endless power ... Recognizing only the French nation the revolutionaries sought to destroy the identity of other nations. At the beginning of the revolution they abolished the provinces each of which had its own identity and which for some of them represented nations establishing in their place the division into departments which will be extended to the new conquests made during the revolutionary and Napoleonic eras. The revolutionaries had at first tolerated languages and dialects other than French. In 1794 under the impetus of Grégoire by decree of Thermidor Year II the Jacobins instituted policy aimed at the destruction of any language or dialect other than French. The title of Grégoire 's report presented to the convention announced its program Report on the necessity and means of annihilating the patois and universalizing the use of the French language.These characteristics of Jacobin ideology which contrast with the revolutionary discourse on freedom and equality have been highlighted by critical historians in the tradition of Tocqueville notably by Hoel in Jacobin Ideology. They remain little addressed by most historians. In La Révolution française et la fin des colonies Y. Bénot noted in chapter entitled Dans le miroir truqué des historiens In the rigged mirror of historians the general silence of most of the historiography on matters related to slavery and colonialism. French Revolutionary Wars The Revolution initiated series of conflicts that began in 1792 and ended only with Napoleon 's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. In its early stages this seemed unlikely the 1791 Constitution specifically disavowed war for the purpose of conquest and although traditional tensions between France and Austria re-emerged in the 1780s Emperor Joseph II cautiously welcomed the reforms. Austria was at war with the Ottomans as were the Russians while both were negotiating with Prussia over partitioning Poland. Most importantly Britain preferred peace and as Emperor Leopold II stated after the Declaration of Pillnitz without England there is no case .In late 1791 factions within the Assembly came to see war as way to unite the country and secure the Revolution by eliminating hostile forces on its borders and establishing its natural frontiers. France declared war on Austria in April 1792 and issued the first conscription orders with recruits serving for twelve months. By the time peace finally came in 1815 the conflict had involved every major European power as well as the United States redrawn the map of Europe and expanded into the Americas the Middle East and the Indian Ocean.From 1701 to 1801 the population of Europe grew from 118 to 187 million combined with new mass production techniques this allowed belligerents to support large armies requiring the mobilisation of national resources. It was different kind of war fought by nations rather than kings intended to destroy their opponents ability to resist but also to implement deep-ranging social change. While all wars are political to some degree this period was remarkable for the emphasis placed on reshaping boundaries and the creation of entirely new European states.In April 1792 French armies invaded the Austrian Netherlands but suffered series of setbacks before victory over an Austrian-Prussian army at Valmy in September. After defeating second Austrian army at Jemappes on November they occupied the Netherlands areas of the Rhineland Nice and Savoy. Emboldened by this success in February 1793 France declared war on the Dutch Republic Spain and Britain beginning the War of the First Coalition. However the expiration of the 12-month term for the 1792 recruits forced the French to relinquish their conquests. In August new conscription measures were passed and by May 1794 the French army had between 750,000 and 800,000 men. Despite high rates of desertion this was large enough to manage multiple internal and external threats for comparison the combined Prussian-Austrian army was less than 90,000. By February 1795 France had annexed the Austrian Netherlands established their frontier on the left bank of the Rhine and replaced the Dutch Republic with the Batavian Republic satellite state. These victories led to the collapse of the anti-French coalition Prussia made peace in April 1795 followed soon after by Spain leaving Britain and Austria as the only major powers still in the war. In October 1797 series of defeats by Bonaparte in Italy led Austria to agree to the Treaty of Campo Formio in which they formally ceded the Netherlands and recognised the Cisalpine Republic.Fighting continued for two reasons first French state finances had come to rely on indemnities levied on their defeated opponents. Second armies were primarily loyal to their generals for whom the wealth achieved by victory and the status it conferred became objectives in themselves. Leading soldiers like Hoche Pichegru and Carnot wielded significant political influence and often set policy Campo Formio was approved by Bonaparte not the Directory which strongly objected to terms it considered too lenient.Despite these concerns the Directory never developed realistic peace programme fearing the destabilising effects of peace and the consequent demobilisation of hundreds of thousands of young men. As long as the generals and their armies stayed away from Paris they were happy to allow them to continue fighting key factor behind sanctioning Bonaparte 's invasion of Egypt. This resulted in aggressive and opportunistic policies leading to the War of the Second Coalition in November 1798. Slavery imperialism and the Haitian Revolution Although the French Revolution had dramatic impact in numerous areas of Europe the French colonies felt particular influence. As the Martinican author Aimé Césaire put it there was in each French colony specific revolution that occurred on the occasion of the French Revolution in tune with it. The Revolution in Saint-Domingue was the most notable example of slave uprisings in French colonies. In the 1780s Saint-Domingue was France 's wealthiest possession producing more sugar than all the British West Indies islands combined. The revolutionaries remained imperialists who maintained the system of slavery until it was dismantled in Saint-Domingue following the slave revolt that began in August 1791. Sonthonax and Polverel were the two civil commissioners who officially proclaimed the abolition of slavery in 1793. The National Convention did not vote to abolish slavery until February 1794 after three deputies from Saint-Domingue arrived in France to explain why slavery had been abolished in the colony.However the 1794 decree was only implemented in Saint-Domingue Guadeloupe and Guyane and was dead letter in Senegal Mauritius Réunion and Martinique the last of which had been captured by the British and as such remained unaffected by French law.The revolutionaries did not recognize the right to independence nor autonomy to the peoples of the French empire. Toussaint Louverture who emerged during the struggle against the French army as military leader nevertheless managed to obtain autonomy by the fact which was prelude and condition for future independence. Media and symbolism Newspapers Newspapers and pamphlets played central role in stimulating and defining the Revolution. Prior to 1789 there have been small number of heavily censored newspapers that needed royal licence to operate but the Estates-General created an enormous demand for news and over 130 newspapers appeared by the end of the year. Among the most significant were Marat 's L'Ami du peuple and Elysée Loustallot 's Revolutions de Paris. Over the next decade more than 2,000 newspapers were founded 500 in Paris alone. Most lasted only matter of weeks but they became the main communication medium combined with the very large pamphlet literature.Newspapers were read aloud in taverns and clubs and circulated hand to hand. There was widespread assumption that writing was vocation not business and the role of the press was the advancement of civic republicanism. By 1793 the radicals were most active but initially the royalists flooded the country with their publication the L'Ami du Roi Friends of the King until they were suppressed. Revolutionary symbols To illustrate the differences between the new Republic and the old regime the leaders needed to implement new set of symbols to be celebrated instead of the old religious and monarchical symbols. To this end symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics. These revised symbols were used to instil in the public new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic. ==== La Marseillaise ==== La Marseillaise French pronunciation la maʁsɛjɛːz became the national anthem of France. The song was written and composed in 1792 by Claude Joseph Rouget de Lisle and was originally titled Chant de guerre pour l'Armée du Rhin. The French National Convention adopted it as the First Republic 's anthem in 1795. It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille marching on the capital. The song is the first example of the European march anthemic style while the evocative melody and lyrics led to its widespread use as song of revolution and incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music. De Lisle was instructed to 'produce hymn which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it the music suggests. ==== Guillotine ==== The guillotine remains the principal symbol of the Terror in the French Revolution. Invented by physician during the Revolution as quicker more efficient and more distinctive form of execution the guillotine became part of popular culture and historic memory. It was celebrated on the left as the people 's avenger for example in the revolutionary song La guillotine permanente and cursed as the symbol of the Terror by the right.Its operation became popular entertainment that attracted great crowds of spectators. Vendors sold programmes listing the names of those scheduled to die. Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings knitting women tricoteuses formed cadre of hardcore regulars inciting the crowd. Parents often brought their children. By the end of the Terror the crowds had thinned drastically. Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments and audiences grew bored. ==== Cockade tricolore and liberty cap ==== Cockades were widely worn by revolutionaries beginning in 1789. They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the Ancien Régime. Camille Desmoulins asked his followers to wear green cockades on 12 July 1789. The Paris militia formed on 13 July adopted blue and red cockade. Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris and they are used on the city 's coat of arms. Cockades with various colour schemes were used during the storming of the Bastille on 14 July.The Liberty cap also known as the Phrygian cap or pileus is brimless felt cap that is conical in shape with the tip pulled forward. It reflects Roman republicanism and liberty alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission in which freed slave receives the bonnet as symbol of his newfound liberty. Role of women The role of women in the Revolution has long been topic of debate. Deprived of political rights under the Ancien Régime the 1791 Constitution classed them as passive citizens leading to demands for social and political equality for women and an end to male domination. They expressed these demands using pamphlets and clubs such as the Cercle Social whose largely male members viewed themselves as contemporary feminists. However in October 1793 the Assembly banned all women 's clubs and the movement was crushed this was driven by the emphasis on masculinity in wartime situation antagonism towards feminine interference in state affairs due to Marie Antoinette and traditional male supremacy. decade later the Napoleonic Code confirmed and perpetuated women 's second-class status.At the beginning of the Revolution women took advantage of events to force their way into the political sphere swore oaths of loyalty solemn declarations of patriotic allegiance and affirmations of the political responsibilities of citizenship. Activists included Girondists like Olympe de Gouges author of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen and Charlotte Corday the killer of Marat. Others like Théroigne de Méricourt Pauline Léon and the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women supported the Jacobins staged demonstrations in the National Assembly and took part in the October 1789 March to Versailles. Despite this the constitutions of 1791 and 1793 denied them political rights and democratic citizenship.On 20 June 1792 number of armed women took part in procession that passed through the halls of the Legislative Assembly into the Tuileries Garden and then through the King 's residence. Women also assumed special role in the funeral of Marat following his murder on 13 July 1793 by Corday as part of the funeral procession they carried the bathtub in which he died as well as shirt stained with his blood. On 20 May 1793 women were in the forefront of crowd demanding bread and the Constitution of 1793 when they went unnoticed they began sacking shops seizing grain and kidnapping officials. The Society of Revolutionary Republican Women militant group on the far left demanded law in 1793 that would compel all women to wear the tricolour cockade to demonstrate their loyalty to the Republic. They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread the major food of the poor people from becoming too expensive. After the Convention passed the law in September 1793 the Revolutionary Republican Women demanded vigorous enforcement but were countered by market women former servants and religious women who adamantly opposed price controls which would drive them out of business and resented attacks on the aristocracy and on religion. Fist fights broke out in the streets between the two factions of women. Meanwhile the men who controlled the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers. At this point the Jacobins controlled the government they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women and decreed that all women 's clubs and associations were illegal. They sternly reminded women to stay home and tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men. Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after 30 October 1793. Prominent women Olympe de Gouges wrote number of plays short stories and novels. Her publications emphasised that women and men are different but this should n't prevent equality under the law. In her Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen she insisted that women deserved rights especially in areas concerning them directly such as divorce and recognition of illegitimate children.Madame Roland a.k.a. Manon or Marie Roland was another important female activist. Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation. She focused on other aspects of the government but was feminist by virtue of the fact that she was woman working to influence the world. Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy in addition she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins political group which allowed women to join. As she was led to the scaffold Madame Roland shouted liberty. What crimes are committed in thy name. Many activists were punished for their actions while some were executed for conspiring against the unity and the indivisibility of the Republic. Counter-revolutionary women Counter-revolutionary women resisted what they saw as the increasing intrusion of the state into their lives. One major consequence was the dechristianisation of France movement strongly rejected by many devout people especially for women living in rural areas the closing of the churches meant loss of normality. This sparked counter-revolutionary movement led by women while supporting other political and social changes they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and revolutionary cults like the Cult of the Supreme Being. Olwen Hufton argues some wanted to protect the Church from heretical changes enforced by revolutionaries viewing themselves as defenders of faith .Economically many peasant women refused to sell their goods for assignats because this form of currency was unstable and was backed by the sale of confiscated Church property. By far the most important issue to counter-revolutionary women was the passage and the enforcement of the Civil Constitution of the Clergy in 1790. In response to this measure women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic. These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary. Economic policies The Revolution abolished many economic constraints imposed by the Ancien Régime including church tithes and feudal dues although tenants often paid higher rents and taxes. All church lands were nationalised along with those owned by Royalist exiles which were used to back paper currency known as assignats and the feudal guild system eliminated. It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming whereby private individuals would collect taxes for hefty fee. The government seized the foundations that had been set up starting in the 13th century to provide an annual stream of revenue for hospitals poor relief and education. The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation 's charitable and school systems were massively disruptedBetween 1790 and 1796 industrial and agricultural output dropped foreign trade plunged and prices soared forcing the government to finance expenditure by issuing ever increasing quantities assignats. When this resulted in escalating inflation the response was to impose price controls and persecute private speculators and traders creating Black market. Between 1789 and 1793 the annual deficit increased from 10 to 64 of gross national product while annual inflation reached 3,500 after poor harvest in 1794 and the removal of price controls. The assignats were withdrawn in 1796 but inflation continued until the introduction of the gold-based Franc germinal in 1803. Long-term impact The French Revolution had major impact on European and Western history by ending feudalism and creating the path for future advances in broadly defined individual freedoms. Its impact on French nationalism was profound while also stimulating nationalist movements throughout Europe. Modern historians argue the concept of the nation state was direct consequence of the Revolution. France The impact of the Revolution on French society was enormous and led to numerous changes some of which were widely accepted while others continue to be debated. Under Louis XIV political power was centralised at Versailles and controlled by the monarch whose power derived from immense personal wealth control over the army and appointment of clergy provincial governors lawyers and judges. In less than year the king was reduced to figurehead the nobility deprived of titles and estates and the church of its monasteries and property. Clergy judges and magistrates were controlled by the state and the army sidelined with military power placed held by the revolutionary National Guard. The central elements of 1789 were the slogan Liberty Equality and Fraternity and The Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen which Lefebvre calls the incarnation of the Revolution as whole. The long-term impact on France was profound shaping politics society religion and ideas and polarising politics for more than century. Historian François Aulard writes From the social point of view the Revolution consisted in the suppression of what was called the feudal system in the emancipation of the individual in greater division of landed property the abolition of the privileges of noble birth the establishment of equality the simplification of life ..... The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national for it aimed at benefiting all humanity. ==== Status of the Catholic church ==== One of the most heated controversies during the Revolution was the status of the Catholic Church. In 1788 it held dominant position within society to be French meant to be Catholic. By 1799 much of its property and institutions had been confiscated and its senior leaders dead or in exile. Its cultural influence was also under attack with efforts made to strip civil life of religious elements such as Sundays holy days saints prayers rituals and ceremonies. Ultimately these attempts not only failed but aroused furious reaction among the pious opposition to these changes was key factor behind the revolt in the Vendée. Over the centuries charitable foundations had been set up to fund hospitals poor relief and schools when these were confiscated and sold off the funding was not replaced causing massive disruption to these support systems. Under the Ancien Régime medical assistance for the rural poor was often provided by nuns acting as nurses but also physicians surgeons and apothecaries the Revolution abolished most of these orders without replacing organised nursing support. Demand remained strong and after 1800 nuns resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates. They were tolerated by officials because they had widespread support and were link between elite male physicians and distrustful peasants who needed help.The church was primary target during the Terror due to its association with counter-revolutionary elements resulting in the persecution of priests and destruction of churches and religious images throughout France. An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether with the Cult of Reason and with civic festivals replacing religious ones leading to attacks by locals on state officials. These policies were promoted by the atheist Hébert and opposed by the deist Robespierre who denounced the campaign and replaced the Cult of Reason with the Cult of the Supreme Being.The Concordat of 1801 established the rules for relationship between the Catholic Church and French State that lasted until it was abrogated by the French Third Republic on 11 December 1905. The Concordat was compromise that restored some of the Church 's traditional roles but not its power lands or monasteries the clergy became public officials controlled by Paris not Rome while Protestants and Jews gained equal rights. However debate continues into the present over the role of religion in the public sphere and related issues such as church-controlled schools. Recent arguments over the use of Muslim religious symbols in schools such as wearing headscarves have been explicitly linked to the conflict over Catholic rituals and symbols during the Revolution. ==== Economics ==== Two thirds of France was employed in agriculture which was transformed by the Revolution. With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands rural France became more land of small independent farms. Harvest taxes were ended such as the tithe and seigneurial dues much to the relief of the peasants. Primogeniture was ended both for nobles and peasants thereby weakening the family patriarch and led to fall in the born rate since all children had share in the family property. Cobban argues the Revolution bequeathed to the nation ruling class of landowners. In the cities entrepreneurship on small scale flourished as restrictive monopolies privileges barriers rules taxes and guilds gave way. However the British blockade virtually ended overseas and colonial trade hurting the cities and their supply chains. Overall the Revolution did not greatly change the French business system and probably helped freeze in place the horizons of the small business owner. The typical businessman owned small store mill or shop with family help and few paid employees large-scale industry was less common than in other industrialising nations.Economic historians dispute the impact on income per capita caused by the emigration of more than 100,000 individuals during the Revolution the vast majority of whom were supporters of the old regime. One suggestion is the resulting fragmentation of agricultural holdings had significant negative impact in the early years of 19th century then became positive in the second half of the century because it facilitated the rise in human capital investments. Others argue the redistribution of land had an immediate positive impact on agricultural productivity before the scale of these gains gradually declined over the course of the 19th century. ==== Constitutionalism ==== The Revolution meant an end to arbitrary royal rule and held out the promise of rule by law under constitutional order but it did not rule out monarch. Napoleon as emperor set up constitutional system although he remained in full control and the restored Bourbons were forced to go along with one. After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871 the monarchists probably had voting majority but they were so factionalised they could not agree on who should be king and instead the French Third Republic was launched with deep commitment to upholding the ideals of the Revolution. The conservative Catholic enemies of the Revolution came to power in Vichy France 1940–44 and tried with little success to undo its heritage but they kept it republic. Vichy denied the principle of equality and tried to replace the Revolutionary watchwords Liberty Equality Fraternity with Work Family and Fatherland. However there were no efforts by the Bourbons Vichy or anyone else to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the nobility in 1789. France permanently became society of equals under the law. Communism The Jacobin cause was picked up by Marxists in the mid-19th century and became an element of communist thought around the world. In the Soviet Union Gracchus Babeuf was regarded as hero. Europe outside France Economic historians Dan Bogart Mauricio Drelichman Oscar Gelderblom and Jean-Laurent Rosenthal described codified law as the French Revolution 's most significant export. They wrote While restoration returned most of their power to the absolute monarchs who had been deposed by Napoleon only the most recalcitrant ones such as Ferdinand VII of Spain went to the trouble of completely reversing the legal innovations brought on by the French. They also note that the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars caused England Spain Prussia and the Dutch Republic to centralize their fiscal systems to an unprecedented extent in order to finance the military campaigns of the Napoleonic Wars.According to Daron Acemoglu Davide Cantoni Simon Johnson and James A. Robinson the French Revolution had long-term effects in Europe. They suggest that areas that were occupied by the French and that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth especially after 1850. There is no evidence of negative effect of French invasion. 2016 study in the European Economic Review found that the areas of Germany that were occupied by France in the 19th century and in which the Code Napoleon was applied have higher levels of trust and cooperation today. ==== Britain ==== On 16 July 1789 two days after the Storming of the Bastille John Frederick Sackville serving as ambassador to France reported to Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Francis Osborne 5th Duke of Leeds Thus my Lord the greatest revolution that we know anything of has been effected with comparatively speaking if the magnitude of the event is considered the loss of very few lives. From this moment we may consider France as free country the King very limited monarch and the nobility as reduced to level with the rest of the nation. Yet in Britain the majority especially among the aristocracy strongly opposed the French Revolution. Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815 and then restored the Bourbons. Philosophically and politically Britain was in debate over the rights and wrongs of revolution in the abstract and in practicalities. The Revolution Controversy was pamphlet war set off by the publication of Discourse on the Love of Our Country speech given by Richard Price to the Revolution Society on November 1789 supporting the French Revolution as he had the American Revolution and saying that patriotism actually centers around loving the people and principles of nation not its ruling class. Edmund Burke responded in November 1790 with his own pamphlet Reflections on the Revolution in France attacking the French Revolution as threat to the aristocracy of all countries. William Coxe opposed Price 's premise that one 's country is principles and people not the State itself.Conversely two seminal political pieces of political history were written in Price 's favour supporting the general right of the French people to replace their State. One of the first of these pamphlets into print was Vindication of the Rights of Men by Mary Wollstonecraft better known for her later treatise sometimes described as the first feminist text Vindication of the Rights of Woman Wollstonecraft 's title was echoed by Thomas Paine 's Rights of Man published few months later. In 1792 Christopher Wyvill published Defence of Dr. Price and the Reformers of England plea for reform and moderation.This exchange of ideas has been described as one of the great political debates in British history. Even in France there was varying degree of agreement during this debate English participants generally opposing the violent means that the Revolution bent itself to for its ends.In Ireland the effect was to transform what had been an attempt by Protestant settlers to gain some autonomy into mass movement led by the Society of United Irishmen involving Catholics and Protestants. It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland especially in Ulster. The upshot was revolt in 1798 led by Wolfe Tone that was crushed by Britain. ==== Germany ==== German reaction to the Revolution swung from favourable to antagonistic. At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas the end of guilds serfdom and the Jewish ghetto. It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform. Above all the antagonism helped stimulate and shape German nationalism. ==== Switzerland ==== The French invaded Switzerland and turned it into the Helvetic Republic 1798–1803 French puppet state. French interference with localism and traditions was deeply resented in Switzerland although some reforms took hold and survived in the later period of restoration. ==== Belgium ==== The region of modern-day Belgium was divided between two polities the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège. Both territories experienced revolutions in 1789. In the Austrian Netherlands the Brabant Revolution succeeded in expelling Austrian forces and established the new United Belgian States. The Liège Revolution expelled the tyrannical Prince-Bishop and installed republic. Both failed to attract international support. By December 1790 the Brabant revolution had been crushed and Liège was subdued the following year. During the Revolutionary Wars the French invaded and occupied the region between 1794 and 1814 time known as the French period. The new government enforced new reforms incorporating the region into France itself. New rulers were sent in by Paris. Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed. Nearly everyone was Catholic but the Church was repressed. Resistance was strong in every sector as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule. The French legal system however was adopted with its equal legal rights and abolition of class distinctions. Belgium now had government bureaucracy selected by merit.Antwerp regained access to the sea and grew quickly as major port and business centre. France promoted commerce and capitalism paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining. In economics therefore the nobility declined while middle-class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in large market paving the way for Belgium 's leadership role after 1815 in the Industrial Revolution on the Continent. ==== Scandinavia ==== The Kingdom of Denmark adopted liberalising reforms in line with those of the French Revolution with no direct contact. Reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating class of independent peasant freeholders. Much of the initiative came from well-organised liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.The Constitution of Norway of 1814 was inspired by the French Revolution and was considered to be one of the most liberal and democratic constitutions at the time. North America ==== Canada ==== Coverage of the Revolution in the then Province of Quebec took place against the background of an ongoing campaign for constitutional reform by Loyalist emigrants from the United States. With the press reliant on reprinting articles from British newspapers local opinion followed them in being generally positive on the aims and objectives of the revolutionaries. This made it increasingly difficult to justify the withholding of electoral rights with the British Home Secretary William Grenville remarking it was difficult to deny to so large body of British Subjects the benefits of the British Constitution. This led to the Constitutional Act 1791 which split the Province into two separate colonies each with its own electoral assembly the predominantly French-speaking Lower Canada and predominantly English-speaking Upper Canada.French migration into the Canadas significantly declined during and after the Revolution with only limited numbers of artisans professionals and religious emigres permitted to settle in that period. Most emigres settled in Montreal or Quebec City although French nobleman Joseph-Geneviève de Puisaye and small group of Royalists settled lands north of York modern day Toronto. The influx of religious migrants also reinvigorated the local Catholic Church with exiled priests establishing number of parishes throughout the Canadas. ==== United States ==== The French Revolution deeply polarised American politics and this polarisation led to the creation of the First Party System. In 1793 as war broke out in Europe the Democratic-Republican Party led by former American minister to France Thomas Jefferson favored revolutionary France and pointed to the 1778 treaty that was still in effect. George Washington and his unanimous cabinet including Jefferson decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war. Washington proclaimed neutrality instead. Under President John Adams Federalist an undeclared naval war took place with France from 1798 until 1799 often called the Quasi War. Jefferson became president in 1801 but was hostile to Napoleon as dictator and emperor. However the two entered negotiations over the Louisiana Territory and agreed to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 an acquisition that substantially increased the size of the United States. Historiography The French Revolution has received enormous amounts of historical attention both from the general public as well as scholars and academics while perspectives on its significance and major developments have often been characterised as falling along ideological lines. In general studies of the Revolution initially focused on political ideas and developments but gradually shifted towards social history that analyses its impact on individuals.Contemporary conservatives like Edmund Burke and Friedrich von Gentz argued it was the product of few conspiratorial individuals who brainwashed the masses into subverting the old order claim rooted in the belief that the revolutionaries had no legitimate complaints. In the 19th century the Revolution was heavily analysed by economists and political scientists like Alexis de Tocqueville who suggested it was the result of more prosperous middle class becoming conscious of its social importance. Perhaps the most influential was Karl Marx who viewed the social class nature of the Revolution as fundamental to understanding human social evolution itself. He argued the egalitarian values it introduced gave rise to classless and co-operative model for society called socialism which found direct expression in the 1870 to 1871 Paris Commune.For much of the 20th century historians influenced by Marx notably Albert Soboul emphasised the role of the peasants and urban workers in the Revolution and presented it as class struggle. The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie with support from the sans-culottes who united to destroy the aristocracy. However Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s the theme of class conflict was widely discredited but no new explanatory model has gained widespread support. Nevertheless in Western history the Revolution is still seen as key dividing point between the early modern and late modern periods and thus one of its most important events.Within France itself the Revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church although the two institutions survived despite the damage they sustained. After the collapse of the First French Empire in 1815 the French public lost many of the rights and privileges earned since the Revolution but remembered the participatory politics that characterised the period. According to one historian Thousands of men and even many women gained firsthand experience in the political arena they talked read and listened in new ways they voted they joined new organisations and they marched for their political goals. Revolution became tradition and republicanism an enduring option. It is also suggested the French underwent fundamental transformation in self-identity evidenced by the elimination of privileges and their replacement by intrinsic human rights as well as decline in social deference that highlighted the principle of equality throughout the Revolution. The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world. Biases in the historiography of the French Revolution The history of the French Revolution has generally been written with three strong biases the white one the French one and the Jacobin one. The white bias minimizes or ignores the problem of slavery the question of colonies and the Haitian Revolution. In his foreword to R. R. Palmer 's book The Age of the Democratic Revolution Political History of Europe and America D. Armitage noted the omission of the Haitian revolution from the work. In his book Silencing the Past Power and the Production of History in the chapter 'An Unthinkable History. The Haitian Revolution as Non-Event M.-R. Trouillot said of the Haitian Revolution that it is the revolution that the world forgot. F. Gauthier wrote for her part that until A. Césaire the historiography of the French Revolution ignored the colonial problem .The French bias includes the white one but it minimizes or ignores more generally all subjects related to colonies and imperialism regardless of the question of slavery which concerned only the black population. The French bias also attributes responsibility for the wars declared in 1792 and 1793 by France to Austria England etc. to these very powers. Historians such as Mignet Thiers and Michelet have adopted this view. Mignet for example wrote in his Histoire de la révolution française France was threatened by the fate that Holland had just suffered and perhaps that of Poland. The whole question was reduced to waiting or anticipating the war taking advantage of the enthusiasm of the people or letting it cool. The real author of war is not the one who declares it but the one who makes it necessary. This view has been challenged among others by Blanning in The origins of the French revolutionary wars and before him by Michon in Essai sur l'histoire du parti feuillant. Both blamed the war on France. Michon wrote for example There was no question of an external danger of aggression by foreign powers ... The Jacobin bias generally includes the white and French ones but not always. For example because of the debate between supporters and opponents of the war with Brissot and Robespierre as the most notable figures Brissot advocating war Robespierre opposing it neo-Jacobin historians like Michon have blamed the war not on Austria and the others great powers but on the Girondins. As Blanning said The predominantly neo-Jacobin tone of most French historical writing on the Revolution has cost Brissot and his supporters dear in terms of reputation. Georges Michon whose detestation of Brissot was matched only by his adulation of Robespierre delivered the definitive indictment 'The war he stated baldly 'was desired and provoked by the Girondins. The Jacobin bias is also particularly visible in the favorable sentiment with which the fall of the Girondins at the end of May-beginning of June 1793 is perceived. If white French and Jacobin biases are so strong among historians it is because they were those of the majority of revolutionaries with whom the majority of historians identify themselves. As Blanning said the tone of most French historical writing on the Revolution is predominantly neo-Jacobin. The identification of historians with revolutionaries has been recognized and often strongly claimed by historians themselves. The revolutionary heroes as A. Cobban called them have become in fact very few the two main ones being Danton and Robespierre two Jacobins. And because they were ultimately strongly opposed to each other so are historians. Danton was the hero of Michelet and Aulard. Mathiez although disciple of Aulard nevertheless devoted much of his work to destroy Danton 's reputation. Danton reputation said Cobban can never more than partially recover from the vendetta waged in the name of Robespierre against him by Mathiez. Robespierre was the hero of the Marxist historians Mathiez Lefebvre and Soboul but he was and is also the hero of non-Marxist historians like Hamel Furet Linton and many others. There remain however historians who fight the Jacobin bias. Among them are those who identify themselves with non-Jacobin revolutionaries especially Brissot and those of his party. Although major figure among revolutionaries Brissot has rarely been prized by historians. notable exception is J. Israel in Revolutionary Ideas. As result he was attacked by Robespierre 's partisans. Israel is interested not only in Brissot but in all those around him men like Condorcet for example linking all these revolutionaries to the European intellectuals he calls the radical enlighteners. In Response to Chappey and Missé Israel wrote want to show that as regards the democratic republican core of the French Revolution Robespierre was in no way La révolution incarnée quite the opposite. Obviously my book clashes outright with the recent trend in French Revolution historiography since 2000 that some now triumphantly designate the retour de Robespierre. ... Belissa and Bosc construe the maligners and detractors of Robespierre as contra-revolutionnaire but that term scarcely applies to the radical enlighteners am focusing on ... In opposition to historians who identify with revolutionaries are critical historians who take an outside look at the revolution in the tradition of Tocqueville and his book L'Ancien régime et la Révolution. Among those historians who radically combat Jacobin French and more rarely white biases are Taine Cochin Sorel Cobban Doyle Bénot Blanning and Hoel. For these historians the French Revolution is less revolution than an acceleration of an evolution underway under the monarchy. The revolution is not to be seen in ideological terms but essentially as power struggle whether at the international level or within the French Empire as Cobban said True public opinion in all countries saw the struggle as an ideological one between revolution and established order but those who actually determined international policies were free from this illusion though they had to allow for and were prepared to make use of it in others. The history of the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars can be told almost exclusively in terms of power politics and explained by the traditions of the countries involved and the personalities of their rulers and ministers. ... The frank recognition of the dominance of power politics in international relations has not been without its effect on the writing of domestic French history.

Chess annotation symbols,When annotating chess games commentators frequently use widely recognized annotation symbols. Question marks and exclamation points that denote move as bad or good are ubiquitous in chess literature. Some publications intended for an international audience such as the Chess Informant have wide range of additional symbols that transcend language barriers.The common symbols for evaluating the merits of move are. . . . . and. The chosen symbol is appended to the text describing the move e.g. Re7. or Kh1. see Algebraic chess notation. Use of these annotation symbols is subjective as different annotators use the same symbols differently. Moreover an annotator 's use of symbols is often influenced by the player 's strength for example positional misjudgment that an annotator might give. if played by strong grandmaster might pass unremarked if played by novice. Annotators use of punctuation may also be influenced by the result of the game regardless of the actual quality of the move this tendency is sometimes referred to as annotation by result.,When annotating chess games commentators frequently use widely recognized annotation symbols.

Annotators use of punctuation may also be influenced by the result of the game regardless of the actual quality of the move this tendency is sometimes referred to as annotation by result. Evaluation symbols Moves Move evaluation symbols by increasing effectiveness of the move ====. . Blunder ==== The double question mark. indicates blunder very bad move that severely worsens the player 's position. Typical moves that receive double question marks are those that overlook tactic that wins substantial material or overlook checkmate. . -worthy move usually results in an immediately lost position. Occasionally the sign is used for move that transforms won position into draw perhaps because the annotator feels that the mistake is unworthy of the player 's skill level. Blunders occur at all levels of play to all human competitors. ====. Mistake ==== single question mark. indicates that the annotator thinks that the move is poor one and that it should not have been played. Mistakes often lead to loss of tempo material or otherwise worsening of the player 's position. The nature of mistake may be more strategic than tactical in some cases the move receiving question mark may be one for which it is difficult to find refutation. move that overlooks forthcoming brilliant combination from the opponent would rarely receive more than one question mark for example. Whether single or double question mark is used is subjective and may depend on the player 's strength. For instance if beginner makes serious strategic error for instance accepting gratuitous pawn weaknesses or exchanging into lost endgame or overlooks tactical sequence this might be explained by the beginner 's lack of skill and be given only one question mark. If master were to make the same move some annotators might use the double question mark to indicate that one would never expect player of master strength to make such weak move. ====. . Dubious move ==== This symbol is similar to the. below but usually indicates that the annotator believes the move to be dubious or questionable but to possibly have merits. The. may also indicate that the annotator believes the move is weak/deserving of criticism but not bad enough to warrant. sacrifice leading to dangerous attack that the opponent should be able to defend against if they play well may receive. Alternatively this may denote move that is objectively bad but sets up an attractive trap. ====. . Interesting move ==== The. is one of the more controversial symbols. Different books have slightly varying definitions. Among the definitions are interesting but perhaps not the best move move deserving attention enterprising move and risky move. Usually it indicates that the move leads to exciting or wild play but that the objective evaluation of the move is unclear. It is also often used when player sets cunning trap in lost position. Typical moves receiving. are those involving speculative sacrifices or dangerous attacks that might turn out to be strategically deficient. Andrew Soltis jokingly called. the symbol of the lazy annotator who finds move interesting but can not be bothered to work out whether it is good or bad. ====. Good move ==== An exclamation point. indicates good move—especially one that is surprising or requires particular skill. The symbol may also be interpreted as best move. Annotators are usually somewhat conservative with the use of this symbol. Reasons for awarding the symbol vary widely between annotators among them are strong opening novelties well-timed breakthroughs sound sacrifices moves that set traps in lost positions moves that avoid such traps and good psychological choices in the opening. ====. . Brilliant move ==== The double exclamation point. is used for very strong moves such as sound sacrifices of large amounts of material and counter-intuitive moves that prove very powerful. For example in what is known as the Game of the Century the majority of annotators have awarded double exclamation point to 13-year-old Bobby Fischer 's decision to sacrifice his queen. ==== Others ==== few writers have used three or more exclamation points. for exceptionally brilliant moves. For example when annotating Rotlewi–Rubinstein 1907 Hans Kmoch awarded Rubinstein 's 22 ... Rxc3 three exclamation points. Likewise an exceptionally bad blunder may be awarded three or more question marks. The majority of chess writers and editors consider these symbols unnecessary. few writers have used unusual combinations of question marks and exclamation points e.g. . . . for particularly unusual spectacular or controversial moves but these have no generally accepted meaning and are typically used for humorous or entertainment purposes. Sometimes annotation symbols are put in parentheses e.g. . . Different writers have used these in different ways for example Ludek Pachman used. to indicate move that he considered inferior but that he did not wish to comment on further Simon Webb used it to indicate move that is objectively sound but was in his opinion poor psychological choice and Robert Hübner see below used it to indicate move that is inaccurate and makes the player 's task more difficult. Alternative uses Some writers take less subjective or more formalized approach to these symbols. ==== Nunn 's convention ==== In his 1992 book Secrets of Rook Endings and other books in the series Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings and Secrets of Pawnless Endings John Nunn uses these symbols in more specific way in the context of endgames where the optimal line of play can be determined with certainty This convention has been used in some later works such as Fundamental Chess Endings and Secrets of Pawn Endings by Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht but it can be safely assumed the convention is not being used unless there is specific note otherwise. The Nunn convention can not be used to annotate full games because the exact evaluation of position is generally impractical to compute. In 1959 Euwe and Hooper made the same use of the question mark ... decisive error .... ==== Hübner 's approach ==== German grandmaster Robert Hübner prefers an even more specific and restrained use of move evaluation symbols have attached question marks to the moves which change winning position into drawn game or drawn position into losing one according to my judgment move which changes winning game into losing one deserves two question marks .... have distributed question marks in brackets to moves which are obviously inaccurate and significantly increase the difficulty of the player 's task .... There are no exclamation marks as they serve no useful purpose. The best move should be mentioned in the analysis in any case an exclamation mark can only serve to indicate the personal excitement of the commentator. ==== Chess composition ==== When the solution to certain chess problem is given there are also some conventions that have become common practice Key move is marked with at least one. Try move is marked with. Refutation to try move is marked with. When dual avoidance is part of the thematic content of problem avoided duals if listed are marked with. Positions These symbols indicate the strategic balance of the game position Other symbols There are other symbols used by various chess engines and publications such as Chess Informant and Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings when annotating moves or describing positions. Many of the symbols now have Unicode encodings but quite few still require special chess font with appropriated characters.

Chess,Chess is board game between two players. It is sometimes called international chess or Western chess to distinguish it from related games such as xiangqi Chinese chess and shogi Japanese chess. Chess originated as chaturanga in ancient India and from there it made its way to Persia the Byzantine empire and the Arab world. Muslims brought chess to Europe via Spain Al Andalus and Italy Emirate of Sicily. Eastern Slavs spread it to the Kievan Rus and the Vikings carried the game as far as Iceland and England.

In 1997 Deep Blue became the first computer to beat the reigning World Champion in match when it defeated Garry Kasparov. Today 's chess engines are significantly stronger than the best human players and have deeply influenced the development of chess theory. Rules The rules of chess are published by FIDE Fédération Internationale des Échecs chess 's international governing body in its Handbook. Rules published by national governing bodies or by unaffiliated chess organizations commercial publishers etc. may differ in some details. FIDE 's rules were most recently revised in 2023. Setup Chess pieces are divided into two different colored sets. While the sets might not be literally white and black e.g. the light set may be yellowish or off-white color the dark set may be brown or red they are always referred to as white and black. The players of the sets are referred to as White and Black respectively. Each set consists of sixteen pieces one king one queen two rooks two bishops two knights and eight pawns. Chess sets come in wide variety of styles for competition the Staunton pattern is preferred. The game is played on square board of eight rows called ranks and eight columns called files. By convention the 64 squares alternate in color and are referred to as light and dark squares common colors for chessboards are white and brown or white and dark green. The pieces are set out as shown in the diagram and photo. Thus on White 's first rank from left to right the pieces are placed in the following order rook knight bishop queen king bishop knight rook. On the second rank is placed row of eight pawns. Black 's position mirrors White 's with an equivalent piece on the same file. The board is placed with light square at the right-hand corner nearest to each player. The correct positions of the king and queen may be remembered by the phrase queen on her own color i.e. the white queen begins on light square and the black queen on dark square. In competitive games the piece colors are allocated to players by the organizers in informal games the colors are usually decided randomly for example by coin toss or by one player concealing white pawn in one hand and black pawn in the other and having the opponent choose. Movement White moves first after which players alternate turns moving one piece per turn except for castling when two pieces are moved. piece is moved to either an unoccupied square or one occupied by an opponent 's piece which is captured and removed from play. With the sole exception of en passant all pieces capture by moving to the square that the opponent 's piece occupies. Moving is compulsory player may not skip turn even when having to move is detrimental. Each piece has its own way of moving. In the diagrams the dots mark the squares to which the piece can move if there are no intervening piece of either color except the knight which leaps over any intervening pieces. All pieces except the pawn can capture an enemy piece if it is located on square to which they would be able to move if the square was unoccupied. The squares on which pawns can capture enemy pieces are marked in the diagram with black crosses. The king moves one square in any direction. There is also special move called castling that involves moving the king and rook. The king is the most valuable piece attacks on the king must be immediately countered and if this is impossible immediate loss of the game ensues see Check and checkmate below. rook can move any number of squares along rank or file but can not leap over other pieces. Along with the king rook is involved during the king 's castling move. bishop can move any number of squares diagonally but can not leap over other pieces. queen combines the power of rook and bishop and can move any number of squares along rank file or diagonal but can not leap over other pieces. knight moves to any of the closest squares that are not on the same rank file or diagonal. Thus the move forms an -shape two squares vertically and one square horizontally or two squares horizontally and one square vertically. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces. pawn can move forward to the unoccupied square immediately in front of it on the same file or on its first move it can advance two squares along the same file provided both squares are unoccupied black dots in the diagram. pawn can capture an opponent 's piece on square diagonally in front of it by moving to that square black crosses. It can not capture piece while advancing along the same file. pawn has two special moves the en passant capture and promotion. ==== Check and checkmate ==== When king is under immediate attack it is said to be in check. move in response to check is legal only if it results in position where the king is no longer in check. This can involve capturing the checking piece interposing piece between the checking piece and the king which is possible only if the attacking piece is queen rook or bishop and there is square between it and the king or moving the king to square where it is not under attack. Castling is not permissible response to check.The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent this occurs when the opponent 's king is in check and there is no legal way to get it out of check. It is never legal for player to make move that puts or leaves the player 's own king in check. In casual games it is common to announce check when putting the opponent 's king in check but this is not required by the rules of chess and is not usually done in tournaments. ==== Castling ==== Once per game each king can make move known as castling. Castling consists of moving the king two squares toward rook of the same color on the same rank and then placing the rook on the square that the king crossed. Castling is permissible if the following conditions are met Neither the king nor the rook has previously moved during the game. There are no pieces between the king and the rook. The king is not in check and does not pass through or land on any square attacked by an enemy piece.Castling is still permitted if the rook is under attack or if the rook crosses an attacked square. For castling notation see Notation. ==== En passant ==== When pawn makes two-step advance from its starting position and there is an opponent 's pawn on square next to the destination square on an adjacent file then the opponent 's pawn can capture it en passant in passing moving to the square the pawn passed over. This can be done only on the turn immediately following the enemy pawn 's two-square advance otherwise the right to do so is forfeited. For example in the animated diagram the black pawn advances two squares from g7 to g5 and the white pawn on f5 can take it en passant on g6 but only immediately after the black pawn 's advance. ==== Promotion ==== When pawn advances to its eighth rank as part of the move it is promoted and must be exchanged for the player 's choice of queen rook bishop or knight of the same color. Usually the pawn is chosen to be promoted to queen but in some cases another piece is chosen this is called underpromotion. In the animated diagram the pawn on c7 can be advanced to the eighth rank and be promoted. There is no restriction on the piece promoted to so it is possible to have more pieces of the same type than at the start of the game e.g. two or more queens. If the required piece is not available e.g. second queen an inverted rook is sometimes used as substitute but this is not recognized in FIDE-sanctioned games. End of the game ==== Win ==== game can be won in the following ways Checkmate The king is in check and the player has no legal move. See check and checkmate above. Resignation player may resign conceding the game to the opponent. However if the opponent has no way of checkmating the resigned player this is draw under FIDE Laws. Most tournament players consider it good etiquette to resign in hopeless position. Win on time In games with time control player wins if the opponent runs out of time even if the opponent has superior position as long as the player has theoretical possibility to checkmate the opponent were the game to continue. Forfeit player who cheats violates the rules or violates the rules of conduct specified for the particular tournament can be forfeited. Occasionally both players are forfeited. ==== Draw ==== There are several ways game can end in draw Stalemate If the player to move has no legal move but is not in check the position is stalemate and the game is drawn. Dead position If neither player is able to checkmate the other by any legal sequence of moves the game is drawn. For example if only the kings are on the board all other pieces having been captured checkmate is impossible and the game is drawn by this rule. On the other hand if both players still have knight there is highly unlikely yet theoretical possibility of checkmate so this rule does not apply. The dead position rule supersedes the previous rule which referred to insufficient material extending it to include other positions where checkmate is impossible such as blocked pawn endings where the pawns can not be attacked. Draw by agreement In tournament chess draws are most commonly reached by mutual agreement between the players. The correct procedure is to verbally offer the draw make move then start the opponent 's clock. Traditionally players have been allowed to agree to draw at any point in the game occasionally even without playing move in recent years efforts have been made to discourage short draws for example by forbidding draw offers before move thirty. Threefold repetition This most commonly occurs when neither side is able to avoid repeating moves without incurring disadvantage. In this situation either player can claim draw this requires the players to keep valid written record of the game so that the claim can be verified by the arbiter if challenged. The three occurrences of the position need not occur on consecutive moves for claim to be valid. The addition of the fivefold repetition rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene immediately and declare the game draw after five occurrences of the same position consecutive or otherwise without requiring claim by either player. FIDE rules make no mention of perpetual check this is merely specific type of draw by threefold repetition. Fifty-move rule If during the previous 50 moves no pawn has been moved and no capture has been made either player can claim draw. The addition of the seventy-five-move rule in 2014 requires the arbiter to intervene and immediately declare the game drawn after 75 moves without pawn move or capture without requiring claim by either player. There are several known endgames where it is possible to force mate but it requires more than 50 moves before pawn move or capture is made examples include some endgames with two knights against pawn and some pawnless endgames such as queen against two bishops. Historically FIDE has sometimes revised the fifty-move rule to make exceptions for these endgames but these have since been repealed. Some correspondence chess organizations do not enforce the fifty-move rule. Draw on time In games with time control the game is drawn if player is out of time and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate the player. Draw by resignation Under FIDE Laws game is drawn if player resigns and no sequence of legal moves would allow the opponent to checkmate that player. Time control In competition chess games are played with time control. If player 's time runs out before the game is completed the game is automatically lost provided the opponent has enough pieces left to deliver checkmate. The duration of game ranges from long or classical games which can take up to seven hours even longer if adjournments are permitted to bullet chess under minutes per player for the entire game. Intermediate between these are rapid chess games lasting between one and two hours per game popular time control in amateur weekend tournaments. Time is controlled using chess clock that has two displays one for each player 's remaining time. Analog chess clocks have been largely replaced by digital clocks which allow for time controls with increments. Time controls are also enforced in correspondence chess competitions. typical time control is 50 days for every 10 moves. Notation Historically many different notation systems have been used to record chess moves the standard system today is short-form algebraic notation. In this system each square is uniquely identified by set of coordinates a–h for the files followed by 1–8 for the ranks. The usual format is initial of the piece moved file of destination square rank of destination squareThe pieces are identified by their initials. In English these are king queen rook bishop and knight is used to avoid confusion with king. For example Qg5 means queen moves to the g-file 5th rank that is to the square g5. Different initials may be used for other languages. In chess literature figurine algebraic notation FAN is frequently used to aid understanding independent of language. To resolve ambiguities an additional letter or number is added to indicate the file or rank from which the piece moved e.g. Ngf3 means knight from the g-file moves to the square f3 R1e2 means rook on the first rank moves to e2. For pawns no letter initial is used so e4 means pawn moves to the square e4. If the piece makes capture is usually inserted before the destination square. Thus Bxf3 means bishop captures on f3. When pawn makes capture the file from which the pawn departed is used to identify the pawn making the capture for example exd5 pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5. Ranks may be omitted if unambiguous for example exd pawn on the e-file captures piece somewhere on the d-file. minority of publications use to indicate capture and some omit the capture symbol altogether. In its most abbreviated form exd5 may be rendered simply as ed. An en passant capture may optionally be marked with the notation e.p. If pawn moves to its last rank achieving promotion the piece chosen is indicated after the move for example e1=Q or e1Q. Castling is indicated by the special notations 0-0 or O-O for kingside castling and 0-0-0 or O-O-O for queenside castling. move that places the opponent 's king in check usually has the notation added. There are no specific notations for discovered check or double check. Checkmate can be indicated by. At the end of the game 1–0 means White won 0–1 means Black won and ½–½ indicates draw. Chess moves can be annotated with punctuation marks and other symbols. For example. indicates good move. an excellent move. mistake. blunder. an interesting move that may not be best or. dubious move not easily refuted. For example one variation of simple trap known as the Scholar 's mate see animated diagram can be recorded 1. e4 e5. Qh5. Nc6. Bc4 Nf6. . Qxf7 Variants of algebraic notation include long form algebraic in which both the departure and destination square are indicated abbreviated algebraic in which capture signs check signs and ranks of pawn captures may be omitted and Figurine Algebraic Notation used in chess publications for universal readability regardless of language. Portable Game Notation PGN is text-based file format for recording chess games based on short form English algebraic notation with small amount of markup. PGN files suffix .pgn can be processed by most chess software as well as being easily readable by humans. Until about 1980 the majority of English language chess publications used descriptive notation in which files are identified by the initial letter of the piece that occupies the first rank at the beginning of the game. In descriptive notation the common opening move 1.e4 is rendered as 1.P-K4 pawn to king four. Another system is ICCF numeric notation recognized by the International Correspondence Chess Federation though its use is in decline. In competitive games players are normally required to keep score record of the game. For this purpose only algebraic notation is recognized in FIDE-sanctioned events game scores recorded in different notation system may not be used as evidence in the event of dispute. Organized competition Tournaments and matches Contemporary chess is an organized sport with structured international and national leagues tournaments and congresses. Thousands of chess tournaments matches and festivals are held around the world every year catering to players of all levels. Tournaments with small number of players may use the round-robin format in which every player plays one game against every other player. For large numbers of players the Swiss system may be used in which each player is paired against an opponent who has the same or as similar as possible score in each round. In either case player 's score is usually calculated as point for each game won and one-half point for each game drawn. Variations such as football scoring points for win point for draw may be used by tournament organizers but ratings are always calculated on the basis of standard scoring. There are different ways to denote player 's score in match or tournament most commonly P/G points scored out of games played e.g. 5½/8 P–A points for and points against e.g. 5½–2½ or +W−L=D wins losses draws e.g. +4−1=3. The term match refers not to an individual game but to either series of games between two players or team competition in which each player of one team plays one game against player of the other team. Governance Chess 's international governing body is usually known by its French acronym FIDE pronounced FEE-day French Fédération internationale des échecs or International Chess Federation. FIDE 's membership consists of the national chess organizations of over 180 countries there are also several associate members including various supra-national organizations the International Braille Chess Association IBCA International Committee of Chess for the Deaf ICCD and the International Physically Disabled Chess Association IPCA. FIDE is recognized as sports governing body by the International Olympic Committee but chess has never been part of the Olympic Games. FIDE 's most visible activity is organizing the World Chess Championship role it assumed in 1948. The current World Champion is Magnus Carlsen of Norway. The reigning Women 's World Champion is Ju Wenjun from China.Other competitions for individuals include the World Junior Chess Championship the European Individual Chess Championship the tournaments for the World Championship qualification cycle and the various national championships. Invitation-only tournaments regularly attract the world 's strongest players. Examples include Spain 's Linares event Monte Carlo 's Melody Amber tournament the Dortmund Sparkassen meeting Sofia 's M-tel Masters and Wijk aan Zee 's Tata Steel tournament. Regular team chess events include the Chess Olympiad and the European Team Chess Championship. The World Chess Solving Championship and World Correspondence Chess Championships include both team and individual events these are held independently of FIDE. Titles and rankings In order to rank players FIDE ICCF and most national chess organizations use the Elo rating system developed by Arpad Elo. An average club player has rating of about 1500 the highest FIDE rating of all time 2882 was achieved by Magnus Carlsen on the March 2014 FIDE rating list.Players may be awarded lifetime titles by FIDE Grandmaster GM sometimes International Grandmaster or IGM is used is awarded to world-class chess masters. Apart from World Champion Grandmaster is the highest title chess player can attain. Before FIDE will confer the title on player the player must have an Elo rating of at least 2500 at one time and three results of prescribed standard called norms in tournaments involving other grandmasters including some from countries other than the applicant 's. There are other milestones player can achieve to attain the title such as winning the World Junior Championship. International Master IM. The conditions are similar to GM but less demanding. The minimum rating for the IM title is 2400. FIDE Master FM. The usual way for player to qualify for the FIDE Master title is by achieving FIDE rating of 2300 or more. Candidate Master CM. Similar to FM but with FIDE rating of at least 2200.The above titles are open to both men and women. There are also separate women-only titles Woman Grandmaster WGM Woman International Master WIM Woman FIDE Master WFM and Woman Candidate Master WCM. These require performance level approximately 200 Elo rating points below the similarly named open titles and their continued existence has sometimes been controversial. Beginning with Nona Gaprindashvili in 1978 number of women have earned the open GM title.FIDE also awards titles for arbiters and trainers. International titles are also awarded to composers and solvers of chess problems and to correspondence chess players by the International Correspondence Chess Federation. National chess organizations may also award titles. Theory Chess has an extensive literature. In 1913 the chess historian H.J.R. Murray estimated the total number of books magazines and chess columns in newspapers to be about 5,000. B.H. Wood estimated the number as of 1949 to be about 20,000. David Hooper and Kenneth Whyld write that Since then there has been steady increase year by year of the number of new chess publications. No one knows how many have been printed. Significant public chess libraries include the John G. White Chess and Checkers Collection at Cleveland Public Library with over 32,000 chess books and over 6,000 bound volumes of chess periodicals and the Chess Draughts collection at the National Library of the Netherlands with about 30,000 books.Chess theory usually divides the game of chess into three phases with different sets of strategies the opening typically the first 10 to 20 moves when players move their pieces to useful positions for the coming battle the middlegame and last the endgame when most of the pieces are gone kings typically take more active part in the struggle and pawn promotion is often decisive. Opening theory is concerned with finding the best moves in the initial phase of the game. There are dozens of different openings and hundreds of variants. The Oxford Companion to Chess lists 1,327 named openings and variants.Middlegame theory is usually divided into chess tactics and chess strategy. Chess strategy concentrates on setting and achieving long-term positioning advantages during the game for example where to place different pieces while tactics concerns immediate maneuver. These two aspects of the gameplay can not be completely separated because strategic goals are mostly achieved through tactics while the tactical opportunities are based on the previous strategy of play. Endgame theory is concerned with positions where there are only few pieces left. Theoretics categorize these positions according to the pieces for example King and pawn endings or Rook versus minor piece. Opening chess opening is the group of initial moves of game the opening moves. Recognized sequences of opening moves are referred to as openings and have been given names such as the Ruy Lopez or Sicilian Defense. They are catalogued in reference works such as the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings. There are dozens of different openings varying widely in character from quiet positional play for example the Réti Opening to very aggressive the Latvian Gambit. In some opening lines the exact sequence considered best for both sides has been worked out to more than 30 moves. Professional players spend years studying openings and continue doing so throughout their careers as opening theory continues to evolve. The fundamental strategic aims of most openings are similar development This is the technique of placing the pieces particularly bishops and knights on useful squares where they will have an optimal impact on the game. control of the center Control of the central squares allows pieces to be moved to any part of the board relatively easily and can also have cramping effect on the opponent. king safety It is critical to keep the king safe from dangerous possibilities. correctly timed castling can often enhance this. pawn structure Players strive to avoid the creation of pawn weaknesses such as isolated doubled or backward pawns and pawn islands and to force such weaknesses in the opponent 's position.Most players and theoreticians consider that White by virtue of the first move begins the game with small advantage. This initially gives White the initiative. Black usually strives to neutralize White 's advantage and achieve equality or to develop dynamic counterplay in an unbalanced position. Middlegame The middlegame is the part of the game which starts after the opening. There is no clear line between the opening and the middlegame but typically the middlegame will start when most pieces have been developed. Similarly there is no clear transition from the middlegame to the endgame see start of the endgame. Because the opening theory has ended players have to form plans based on the features of the position and at the same time take into account the tactical possibilities of the position. The middlegame is the phase in which most combinations occur. Combinations are series of tactical moves executed to achieve some gain. Middlegame combinations are often connected with an attack against the opponent 's king. Some typical patterns have their own names for example the Boden 's Mate or the Lasker–Bauer combination.Specific plans or strategic themes will often arise from particular groups of openings which result in specific type of pawn structure. An example is the minority attack which is the attack of queenside pawns against an opponent who has more pawns on the queenside. The study of openings is therefore connected to the preparation of plans that are typical of the resulting middlegames.Another important strategic question in the middlegame is whether and how to reduce material and transition into an endgame i.e. simplify. Minor material advantages can generally be transformed into victory only in an endgame and therefore the stronger side must choose an appropriate way to achieve an ending. Not every reduction of material is good for this purpose for example if one side keeps light-squared bishop and the opponent has dark-squared one the transformation into bishops and pawns ending is usually advantageous for the weaker side only because an endgame with bishops on opposite colors is likely to be draw even with an advantage of pawn or sometimes even with two-pawn advantage. ==== Tactics ==== In chess tactics in general concentrate on short-term actions so short-term that they can be calculated in advance by human player or computer. The possible depth of calculation depends on the player 's ability. In quiet positions with many possibilities on both sides deep calculation is more difficult and may not be practical while in positions with limited number of forced variations strong players can calculate long sequences of moves. Theoreticians describe many elementary tactical methods and typical maneuvers for example pins forks skewers batteries discovered attacks especially discovered checks zwischenzugs deflections decoys sacrifices underminings overloadings and interferences. Simple one-move or two-move tactical actions threats exchanges of material and double attacks can be combined into more complicated sequences of tactical maneuvers that are often forced from the point of view of one or both players. forced variation that involves sacrifice and usually results in tangible gain is called combination. Brilliant combinations such as those in the Immortal Game are considered beautiful and are admired by chess lovers. common type of chess exercise aimed at developing players skills is position where decisive combination is available and the challenge is to find it. ==== Strategy ==== Chess strategy is concerned with the evaluation of chess positions and with setting up goals and long-term plans for future play. During the evaluation players must take into account numerous factors such as the value of the pieces on the board control of the center and centralization the pawn structure king safety and the control of key squares or groups of squares for example diagonals open files and dark or light squares. The most basic step in evaluating position is to count the total value of pieces of both sides. The point values used for this purpose are based on experience usually pawns are considered worth one point knights and bishops about three points each rooks about five points the value difference between rook and bishop or knight being known as the exchange and queens about nine points. The king is more valuable than all of the other pieces combined since its checkmate loses the game. But in practical terms in the endgame the king as fighting piece is generally more powerful than bishop or knight but less powerful than rook. These basic values are then modified by other factors like position of the piece e.g. advanced pawns are usually more valuable than those on their initial squares coordination between pieces e.g. pair of bishops usually coordinate better than bishop and knight or the type of position e.g. knights are generally better in closed positions with many pawns while bishops are more powerful in open positions .Another important factor in the evaluation of chess positions is pawn structure sometimes known as the pawn skeleton the configuration of pawns on the chessboard. Since pawns are the least mobile of the pieces pawn structure is relatively static and largely determines the strategic nature of the position. Weaknesses in pawn structure include isolated doubled or backward pawns and holes once created they are often permanent. Care must therefore be taken to avoid these weaknesses unless they are compensated by another valuable asset for example by the possibility of developing an attack. Endgame The endgame also end game or ending is the stage of the game when there are few pieces left on the board. There are three main strategic differences between earlier stages of the game and the endgame Pawns become more important. Endgames often revolve around endeavors to promote pawn by advancing it to the furthest rank. The king which requires safeguarding from attack during the middlegame emerges as strong piece in the endgame. It is often brought to the center where it can protect its own pawns attack enemy pawns and hinder moves of the opponent 's king. Zugzwang situation in which the player who is to move is forced to incur disadvantage is often factor in endgames but rarely in other stages of the game. In the example diagram either side having the move is in zugzwang Black to move must play ... Kb7 allowing White to promote the pawn after 2.Kd7 White to move must permit draw either by 1.Kc6 stalemate or by losing the pawn after any other legal move.Endgames can be classified according to the type of pieces remaining on the board. Basic checkmates are positions in which one side has only king and the other side has one or two pieces and can checkmate the opposing king with the pieces working together with their king. For example king and pawn endgames involve only kings and pawns on one or both sides and the task of the stronger side is to promote one of the pawns. Other more complicated endings are classified according to pieces on the board other than kings such as rook and pawn versus rook endgames. History Origins The earliest texts referring to the origins of chess date from the beginning of the 7th century. Three are written in Pahlavi Middle Persian and one the Harshacharita is in Sanskrit. One of these texts the Chatrang-namak represents one of the earliest written accounts of chess. The narrator Bozorgmehr explains that Chatrang the Pahlavi word for chess was introduced to Persia by 'Dewasarm great ruler of India during the reign of Khosrow I.The oldest known chess manual was in Arabic and dates to about 840 written by al-Adli ar-Rumi 800–870 renowned Arab chess player titled Kitab ash-shatranj The Book of Chess. This is lost manuscript but is referenced in later works. Here also al-Adli attributes the origins of Persian chess to India along with the eighth-century collection of fables Kalīla wa-Dimna. By the twentieth century substantial consensus developed regarding chess 's origins in northwest India in the early 7th century. More recently this consensus has been the subject of further scrutiny.The early forms of chess in India were known as chaturaṅga Sanskrit चतुरङ्ग literally four divisions of the military infantry cavalry elephants and chariotry represented by pieces which would later evolve into the modern pawn knight bishop and rook respectively. Chaturanga was played on an 8×8 uncheckered board called ashtāpada. Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sasanian Persia around 600 A.D. where the game came to be known by the name chatrang Persian چترنگ. Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia 633–51 where it was then named shatranj Arabic شطرنج Persian شترنج with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish shatranj was rendered as ajedrez al-shatranj in Portuguese as xadrez and in Greek as ζατρίκιον zatrikion which comes directly from the Persian chatrang but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh king from which the English words check and chess descend. The word checkmate is derived from the Persian shāh māt the king is dead. Xiangqi is the form of chess best-known in China. The eastern migration of chess into China and Southeast Asia has even less documentation than its migration west making it largely conjectured. The word xiàngqí 象棋 was used in China to refer to game from 569 A.D. at the latest but it has not been proven if this game was or was not directly related to chess. The first reference to Chinese chess appears in book entitled Xuán guaì lù 玄怪錄 Record of the Mysterious and Strange dating to about 800. minority view holds that western chess arose from xiàngqí or one of its predecessors although this has been contested. Chess historians Jean-Louis Cazaux and Rick Knowlton contend that xiangqi 's intrinsic characteristics make it easier to construct an evolutionary path from China to India/Persia than the opposite direction.The oldest archaeological chess artifacts ivory pieces were excavated in ancient Afrasiab today 's Samarkand in Uzbekistan Central Asia and date to about 760 with some of them possibly being older. Remarkably almost all findings of the oldest pieces come from along the Silk Road from the former regions of the Tarim Basin today 's Xinjiang in China Transoxiana Sogdiana Bactria Gandhara to Iran on one end and to India through Kashmir on the other.The game reached Western Europe and Russia via at least three routes the earliest being in the 9th century. By the year 1000 it had spread throughout both the Muslim Iberia and Latin Europe. Latin poem called Versus de scachis Verses on Chess dated to the late 10th century has been preserved at Einsiedeln Abbey in Switzerland. 1200–1700 introduction of new rules The game of chess was then played and known in all European countries. famous 13th-century Spanish manuscript covering chess backgammon and dice is known as the Libro de los juegos which is the earliest European treatise on chess as well as being the oldest document on European tables games. The rules were fundamentally similar to those of the Arabic shatranj. The differences were mostly in the use of checkered board instead of plain monochrome board used by Arabs and the habit of allowing some or all pawns to make an initial double step. In some regions the Queen which had replaced the Wazir and/or the King could also make an initial two-square leap under some conditions. Around 1200 the rules of shatranj started to be modified in Spain Italy and the rest of Southern Europe culminating several major changes later in the emergence of modern chess practically as it is known today. major change was the modern piece movement rules which began to appear in intellectual circles in Valencia Spain around 1475 which established the foundations and brought it very close to current Chess. These new rules then were quickly adopted in Italy and Southern France before diffusing into the rest of Europe. Pawns gained the ability to advance two squares on their first move while bishops and queens acquired their modern movement powers. The queen replaced the earlier vizier chess piece toward the end of the 10th century and by the 15th century had become the most powerful piece in light of that modern chess was often referred to at the time as Queen 's Chess or Mad Queen Chess. Castling derived from the king 's leap usually in combination with pawn or rook move to bring the king to safety was introduced. These new rules quickly spread throughout Western Europe. Writings about chess theory began to appear in the late 15th century. An anonymous treatise on chess of 1490 with the first part containing some openings and the second 30 endgames is deposited in the library of the University of Göttingen. The book El Libro dels jochs partitis dels schachs en nombre de 100 was written by Francesc Vicent in Segorbe in 1495 but no copy of this work has survived. The Repetición de Amores Arte de Ajedrez Repetition of Love and the Art of Playing Chess by Spanish churchman Luis Ramírez de Lucena was published in Salamanca in 1497. Lucena and later masters like Portuguese Pedro Damiano Italians Giovanni Leonardo Di Bona Giulio Cesare Polerio and Gioachino Greco and Spanish bishop Ruy López de Segura developed elements of opening theory and started to analyze simple endgames. 1700–1873 Romantic era In the 18th century the center of European chess life moved from Southern Europe to mainland France. The two most important French masters were François-André Danican Philidor musician by profession who discovered the importance of pawns for chess strategy and later Louis-Charles Mahé de La Bourdonnais who won famous series of matches against Irish master Alexander McDonnell in 1834. Centers of chess activity in this period were coffee houses in major European cities like Café de la Régence in Paris and Simpson 's Divan in London.At the same time the intellectual movement of romanticism had had far-reaching impact on chess with aesthetics and tactical beauty being held in higher regard than objective soundness and strategic planning. As result virtually all games began with the Open Game and it was considered unsportsmanlike to decline gambits that invited tactical play such as the King 's Gambit and the Evans Gambit. This chess philosophy is known as Romantic chess and sharp tactical style consistent with the principles of chess romanticism was predominant until the late 19th century.The rules concerning stalemate were finalized in the early 19th century. Also in the 19th century the convention that White moves first was established formerly either White or Black could move first. Finally the rules around castling and en passant captures were standardized variations in these rules persisted in Italy until the late 19th century. The resulting standard game is sometimes referred to as Western chess or international chess particularly in Asia where other games of the chess family such as xiangqi are prevalent. Since the 19th century the only rule changes such as the establishment of the correct procedure for claiming draw by repetition have been technical in nature. As the 19th century progressed chess organization developed quickly. Many chess clubs chess books and chess journals appeared. There were correspondence matches between cities for example the London Chess Club played against the Edinburgh Chess Club in 1824. Chess problems became regular part of 19th-century newspapers Bernhard Horwitz Josef Kling and Samuel Loyd composed some of the most influential problems. In 1843 von der Lasa published his and Bilguer 's Handbuch des Schachspiels Handbook of Chess the first comprehensive manual of chess theory. The first modern chess tournament was organized by Howard Staunton leading English chess player and was held in London in 1851. It was won by the German Adolf Anderssen who was hailed as the leading chess master. His brilliant energetic attacking style was typical for the time. Sparkling games like Anderssen 's Immortal Game and Evergreen Game or Morphy 's Opera Game were regarded as the highest possible summit of the art of chess.Deeper insight into the nature of chess came with the American Paul Morphy an extraordinary chess prodigy. Morphy won against all important competitors except Staunton who refused to play including Anderssen during his short chess career between 1857 and 1863. Morphy 's success stemmed from combination of brilliant attacks and sound strategy he intuitively knew how to prepare attacks. 1873–1945 Birth of sport Prague-born Wilhelm Steinitz laid the foundations for scientific approach to the game the art of breaking position down into components and preparing correct plans. In addition to his theoretical achievements Steinitz founded an important tradition his triumph over the leading German master Johannes Zukertort in 1886 is regarded as the first official World Chess Championship. This win marked stylistic transition at the highest levels of chess from an attacking tactical style predominant in the Romantic era to more positional strategic style introduced to the chess world by Steinitz. Steinitz lost his crown in 1894 to much younger player the German mathematician Emanuel Lasker who maintained this title for 27 years the longest tenure of any world champion.After the end of the 19th century the number of master tournaments and matches held annually quickly grew. The first Olympiad was held in Paris in 1924 and FIDE was founded initially for the purpose of organizing that event. In 1927 the Women 's World Chess Championship was established the first to hold the title was Czech-English master Vera Menchik.A prodigy from Cuba José Raúl Capablanca known for his skill in endgames won the World Championship from Lasker in 1921. Capablanca was undefeated in tournament play for eight years from 1916 to 1924. His successor 1927 was the Russian-French Alexander Alekhine strong attacking player who died as the world champion in 1946. Alekhine briefly lost the title to Dutch player Max Euwe in 1935 and regained it two years later.In the interwar period chess was revolutionized by the new theoretical school of so-called hypermodernists like Aron Nimzowitsch and Richard Réti. They advocated controlling the center of the board with distant pieces rather than with pawns thus inviting opponents to occupy the center with pawns which become objects of attack. 1945–1990 Post-World War II era After the death of Alekhine new World Champion was sought. FIDE which has controlled the title since then ran tournament of elite players. The winner of the 1948 tournament was Russian Mikhail Botvinnik. In 1950 FIDE established system of titles conferring the titles of Grandmaster and International Master on 27 players. Some sources state that in 1914 the title of chess Grandmaster was first formally conferred by Tsar Nicholas II of Russia to Lasker Capablanca Alekhine Tarrasch and Marshall but this is disputed claim. Botvinnik started an era of Soviet dominance in the chess world which mainly through the Soviet government 's politically inspired efforts to demonstrate intellectual superiority over the West stood almost uninterrupted for more than half-century. Until the dissolution of the Soviet Union there was only one non-Soviet champion American Bobby Fischer champion 1972–1975. Botvinnik also revolutionized opening theory. Previously Black strove for equality attempting to neutralize White 's first-move advantage. As Black Botvinnik strove for the initiative from the beginning. In the previous informal system of World Championships the current champion decided which challenger he would play for the title and the challenger was forced to seek sponsors for the match. FIDE set up new system of qualifying tournaments and matches. The world 's strongest players were seeded into Interzonal tournaments where they were joined by players who had qualified from Zonal tournaments. The leading finishers in these Interzonals would go through the Candidates stage which was initially tournament and later series of knockout matches. The winner of the Candidates would then play the reigning champion for the title. champion defeated in match had right to play rematch year later. This system operated on three-year cycle. Botvinnik participated in championship matches over period of fifteen years. He won the world championship tournament in 1948 and retained the title in tied matches in 1951 and 1954. In 1957 he lost to Vasily Smyslov but regained the title in rematch in 1958. In 1960 he lost the title to the 23-year-old Latvian prodigy Mikhail Tal an accomplished tactician and attacking player who is widely regarded as one of the most creative players ever hence his nickname the magician from Riga. Botvinnik again regained the title in rematch in 1961. Following the 1961 event FIDE abolished the automatic right of deposed champion to rematch and the next champion Armenian Tigran Petrosian player renowned for his defensive and positional skills held the title for two cycles 1963–1969. His successor Boris Spassky from Russia champion 1969–1972 won games in both positional and sharp tactical style. The next championship the so-called Match of the Century saw the first non-Soviet challenger since World War II American Bobby Fischer. Fischer defeated his opponents in the Candidates matches by unheard-of margins and convincingly defeated Spassky for the world championship. The match was followed closely by news media of the day leading to surge in popularity for chess it also held significant political importance at the height of the Cold War with the match being seen by both sides as microcosm of the conflict between East and West. In 1975 however Fischer refused to defend his title against Soviet Anatoly Karpov when he was unable to reach agreement on conditions with FIDE and Karpov obtained the title by default. Fischer modernized many aspects of chess especially by extensively preparing openings.Karpov defended his title twice against Viktor Korchnoi and dominated the 1970s and early 1980s with string of tournament successes. In the 1984 World Chess Championship Karpov faced his toughest challenge to date the young Garry Kasparov from Baku Soviet Azerbaijan. The match was aborted in controversial circumstances after months and 48 games with Karpov leading by wins to but evidently exhausted many commentators believed Kasparov who had won the last two games would have won the match had it continued. Kasparov won the 1985 rematch. Kasparov and Karpov contested three further closely fought matches in 1986 1987 and 1990 Kasparov winning them all. Kasparov became the dominant figure of world chess from the mid 1980s until his retirement from competition in 2005. ==== Beginnings of chess technology ==== Chess-playing computer programs later known as chess engines began to appear in the 1960s. In 1970 the first major computer chess tournament the North American Computer Chess Championship was held followed in 1974 by the first World Computer Chess Championship. In the late 1970s dedicated home chess computers such as Fidelity Electronics Chess Challenger became commercially available as well as software to run on home computers. However the overall standard of computer chess was low until the 1990s. The first endgame tablebases which provided perfect play for relatively simple endgames such as king and rook versus king and bishop appeared in the late 1970s. This set precedent to the complete six- and seven-piece tablebases that became available in the 2000s and 2010s respectively.The first commercial chess database collection of chess games searchable by move and position was introduced by the German company ChessBase in 1987. Databases containing millions of chess games have since had profound effect on opening theory and other areas of chess research. Digital chess clocks were invented in 1973 though they did not become commonplace until the 1990s. Digital clocks allow for time controls involving increments and delays. 1990–present Rise of computers and online chess ==== Technology ==== The Internet enabled online chess as new medium of playing with chess servers allowing users to play other people from different parts of the world in real time. The first such server known as Internet Chess Server or ICS was developed at the University of Utah in 1992. ICS formed the basis for the first commercial chess server the Internet Chess Club which was launched in 1995 and for other early chess servers such as FICS Free Internet Chess Server. Since then many other platforms have appeared and online chess began to rival over-the-board chess in popularity. During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic the isolation ensuing from quarantines imposed in many places around the world combined with the success of the popular Netflix show The Queen 's Gambit and other factors such as the popularity of online tournaments notably PogChamps and chess Twitch streamers resulted in surge of popularity not only for online chess but for the game of chess in general this phenomenon has been referred to in the media as the 2020 online chess boom.Computer chess has also seen major advances. By the 1990s chess engines could consistently defeat most amateurs and in 1997 Deep Blue defeated World Champion Garry Kasparov in six-game match starting an era of computer dominance at the highest level of chess. In the 2010s engines of superhuman strength became accessible for free on number of PC and mobile platforms and free engine analysis became commonplace feature on internet chess servers. An adverse effect of the easy availability of engine analysis on hand-held devices and personal computers has been the rise of computer cheating which has grown to be major concern in both over-the-board and online chess. In 2017 AlphaZero neural network also capable of playing shogi and Go was introduced. Since then many chess engines based on neural network evaluation have been written the best of which have surpassed the traditional brute-force engines. AlphaZero also introduced many novel ideas and ways of playing the game which affected the style of play at the top level.As endgame tablebases developed they began to provide perfect play in endgame positions in which the game-theoretical outcome was previously unknown such as positions with king queen and pawn against king and queen. In 1991 Lewis Stiller published tablebase for select six-piece endgames and by 2005 following the publication of Nalimov tablebases all six-piece endgame positions were solved. In 2012 Lomonosov tablebases were published which solved all seven-piece endgame positions. Use of tablebases enhances the performance of chess engines by providing definitive results in some branches of analysis. Technological progress made in the 1990s and the 21st century has influenced the way that chess is studied at all levels as well as the state of chess as spectator sport. Previously preparation at the professional level required an extensive chess library and several subscriptions to publications such as Chess Informant to keep up with opening developments and study opponents games. Today preparation at the professional level involves the use of databases containing millions of games and engines to analyze different opening variations and prepare novelties. number of online learning resources are also available for players of all levels such as online courses tactics trainers and video lessons.Since the late 1990s it has been possible to follow major international chess events online the players moves being relayed in real time. Sensory boards have been developed to enable automatic transmission of moves. Chess players will frequently run engines while watching these games allowing them to quickly identify mistakes by the players and spot tactical opportunities. While in the past the moves have been relayed live today chess organizers will often impose half-hour delay as an anti-cheating measure. In the mid-to-late 2010s and especially following the 2020 online boom it became commonplace for supergrandmasters such as Hikaru Nakamura and Magnus Carlsen to livestream chess content on platforms such as Twitch. Also following the boom online chess started being viewed as an e-sport with e-sport teams signing chess players for the first time in 2020. ==== Growth ==== Organized chess even for young children has become common. FIDE holds world championships for age levels down to years old. The largest tournaments in number of players are those held for children.The number of grandmasters and other chess professionals has also grown in the modern era. Kenneth Regan and Guy Haworth conducted research involving comparison of move choices by players of different levels and from different periods with the analysis of strong chess engines they concluded that the increase in the number of grandmasters and higher Elo ratings of the top players reflect an actual increase in the average standard of play rather than rating inflation or title inflation. ==== Professional chess ==== In 1993 Garry Kasparov and Nigel Short broke ties with FIDE to organize their own match for the title and formed competing Professional Chess Association PCA. From then until 2006 there were two simultaneous World Championships and respective World Champions the PCA or classical champions extending the Steinitzian tradition in which the current champion plays challenger in series of games and the other following FIDE 's new format of many players competing in large knockout tournament to determine the champion. Kasparov lost his PCA title in 2000 to Vladimir Kramnik of Russia. Due to the complicated state of world chess politics and difficulties obtaining commercial sponsorships Kasparov was never able to challenge for the title again. Despite this he continued to dominate in top level tournaments and remained the world 's highest rated player until his retirement from competitive chess in 2005. The World Chess Championship 2006 in which Kramnik beat the FIDE World Champion Veselin Topalov reunified the titles and made Kramnik the undisputed World Chess Champion. In September 2007 he lost the title to Viswanathan Anand of India who won the championship tournament in Mexico City. Anand defended his title in the revenge match of 2008 2010 and 2012. In 2013 Magnus Carlsen of Norway beat Anand in the 2013 World Chess Championship. He defended his title times since then and is the reigning world champion. Connections Arts and humanities In the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance chess was part of noble culture it was used to teach war strategy and was dubbed the King 's Game. Gentlemen are to be meanly seene in the play at Chestes says the overview at the beginning of Baldassare Castiglione 's The Book of the Courtier 1528 English 1561 by Sir Thomas Hoby but chess should not be gentleman 's main passion. Castiglione explains it further And what say you to the game at chestes. It is truely an honest kynde of enterteynmente and wittie quoth Syr Friderick. But me think it hath fault whiche is that man may be to couning at it for who ever will be excellent in the playe of chestes beleave he must beestowe much tyme about it and applie it with so much study that man may assoone learne some noble scyence or compase any other matter of importaunce and yet in the ende in beestowing all that laboure he knoweth no more but game. Therfore in this beleave there happeneth very rare thing namely that the meane is more commendable then the excellency. Some of the elaborate chess sets used by the aristocracy at least partially survive such as the Lewis chessmen. Chess was often used as basis of sermons on morality. An example is Liber de moribus hominum et officiis nobilium sive super ludo scacchorum 'Book of the customs of men and the duties of nobles or the Book of Chess written by an Italian Dominican monk Jacobus de Cessolis c. 1300. This book was one of the most popular of the Middle Ages. The work was translated into many other languages the first printed edition was published at Utrecht in 1473 and was the basis for William Caxton 's The Game and Playe of the Chesse 1474 one of the first books printed in English. Different chess pieces were used as metaphors for different classes of people and human duties were derived from the rules of the game or from visual properties of the chess pieces The knyght ought to be made alle armed upon an hors in suche wyse that he haue an helme on his heed and spere in his ryght hande/ and coueryd wyth his sheld/ swerde and mace on his lyft syde/ Cladd wyth an hawberk and plates to fore his breste/ legge harnoys on his legges/ Spores on his heelis on his handes his gauntelettes/ his hors well broken and taught and apte to bataylle and couerid with his armes/ whan the knyghtes ben maad they ben bayned or bathed/ that is the signe that they shold lede newe lyf and newe maners/ also they wake alle the nyght in prayers and orysons vnto god that he wylle gyue hem grace that they may gete that thynge that they may not gete by nature/ The kynge or prynce gyrdeth boute them swerde in signe/ that they shold abyde and kepe hym of whom they take theyr dispenses and dignyte. Known in the circles of clerics students and merchants chess entered into the popular culture of the Middle Ages. An example is the 209th song of Carmina Burana from the 13th century which starts with the names of chess pieces Roch pedites regina .... The game of chess at times has been discouraged by various religious authorities in Middle Ages Jewish Catholic and Orthodox. Some Muslim authorities prohibited it even recently for example Ruhollah Khomeini in 1979 and Abdul-Aziz ash-Sheikh even later.During the Age of Enlightenment chess was viewed as means of self-improvement. Benjamin Franklin in his article The Morals of Chess 1750 wrote The Game of Chess is not merely an idle amusement several very valuable qualities of the mind useful in the course of human life are to be acquired and strengthened by it so as to become habits ready on all occasions for life is kind of Chess in which we have often points to gain and competitors or adversaries to contend with and in which there is vast variety of good and ill events that are in some degree the effect of prudence or the want of it. By playing at Chess then we may learn I. Foresight which looks little into futurity and considers the consequences that may attend an action ... II. Circumspection which surveys the whole Chess-board or scene of action the relation of the several Pieces and their situations ... III. Caution not to make our moves too hastily .... Chess was occasionally criticized in the 19th century as waste of time.Chess is taught to children in schools around the world today. Many schools host chess clubs and there are many scholastic tournaments specifically for children. Tournaments are held regularly in many countries hosted by organizations such as the United States Chess Federation and the National Scholastic Chess Foundation.Chess is many times depicted in the arts significant works where chess plays key role range from Thomas Middleton 's Game at Chess to Through the Looking-Glass by Lewis Carroll to Vladimir Nabokov 's The Defense to The Royal Game by Stefan Zweig. Chess has also featured in film classics such as Ingmar Bergman 's The Seventh Seal Satyajit Ray 's The Chess Players and Powell and Pressburger 's Matter of Life and Death. Chess is also present in contemporary popular culture. For example the characters in Star Trek play futuristic version of the game called Federation Tri-Dimensional Chess and Wizard 's Chess is played in J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter. Mathematics The game structure and nature of chess are related to several branches of mathematics. Many combinatorical and topological problems connected to chess such as the knight 's tour and the eight queens puzzle have been known for hundreds of years. The number of legal positions in chess is estimated to be 4.59 +/- 0.38 x1044 with 95 confidence level with game-tree complexity of approximately 10123. The game-tree complexity of chess was first calculated by Claude Shannon as 10120 number known as the Shannon number. An average position typically has thirty to forty possible moves but there may be as few as zero in the case of checkmate or stalemate or in constructed position as many as 218.In 1913 Ernst Zermelo used chess as basis for his theory of game strategies which is considered one of the predecessors of game theory. Zermelo 's theorem states that it is possible to solve chess i.e. to determine with certainty the outcome of perfectly played game either White can force win or Black can force win or both sides can force at least draw. However with 1043 legal positions in chess it will take an impossibly long time to compute perfect strategy with any feasible technology. Psychology There is an extensive scientific literature on chess psychology. Alfred Binet and others showed that knowledge and verbal rather than visuospatial ability lies at the core of expertise. In his doctoral thesis Adriaan de Groot showed that chess masters can rapidly perceive the key features of position. According to de Groot this perception made possible by years of practice and study is more important than the sheer ability to anticipate moves. De Groot showed that chess masters can memorize positions shown for few seconds almost perfectly. The ability to memorize does not alone account for chess-playing skill since masters and novices when faced with random arrangements of chess pieces had equivalent recall about six positions in each case. Rather it is the ability to recognize patterns which are then memorized which distinguished the skilled players from the novices. When the positions of the pieces were taken from an actual game the masters had almost total positional recall.More recent research has focused on chess as mental training the respective roles of knowledge and look-ahead search brain imaging studies of chess masters and novices blindfold chess the role of personality and intelligence in chess skill gender differences and computational models of chess expertise. The role of practice and talent in the development of chess and other domains of expertise has led to much empirical investigation. Ericsson and colleagues have argued that deliberate practice is sufficient for reaching high levels of expertise in chess. Recent research however fails to replicate their results and indicates that factors other than practice are also important. For example Fernand Gobet and colleagues have shown that stronger players started playing chess at young age and that experts born in the Northern Hemisphere are more likely to have been born in late winter and early spring. Compared to the general population chess players are more likely to be non-right-handed though they found no correlation between handedness and skill.A relationship between chess skill and intelligence has long been discussed in scientific literature as well as in popular culture. Academic studies that investigate the relationship date back at least to 1927. Although one meta-analysis and most children studies find positive correlation between general cognitive ability and chess skill adult studies show mixed results. Composition Chess composition is the art of creating chess problems also called chess compositions. The creator is known as chess composer. There are many types of chess problems the two most important are Directmates White to move first and checkmate Black within specified number of moves against any defense. These are often referred to as mate in for example mate in three three-mover two- and three-move problems are the most common. These usually involve positions that would be highly unlikely to occur in an actual game and are intended to illustrate particular theme usually requiring surprising or counterintuitive key move. Themes associated with chess problems occasionally appear in actual games when they are referred to as problem-like moves. Studies orthodox problems where the stipulation is that White to play must win or draw. The majority of studies are endgame positions.Fairy chess is branch of chess problem composition involving altered rules such as the use of unconventional pieces or boards or unusual stipulations such as reflexmates. Tournaments for composition and solving of chess problems are organized by the World Federation for Chess Composition which works cooperatively with but independent of FIDE. The WFCC awards titles for composing and solving chess problems. Online chess Online chess is chess that is played over the internet allowing players to play against each other in real time. This is done through the use of Internet chess servers which pair up individual players based on their rating using an Elo or similar rating system. Online chess saw spike in growth during the quarantines of the COVID-19 pandemic. This can be attributed to both isolation and the popularity of Netflix miniseries The Queen 's Gambit which was released in October 2020. Chess app downloads on the App Store and Google Play Store rose by 63 after the show debuted. Chess.com saw more than twice as many account registrations in November as it had in previous months and the number of games played monthly on Lichess doubled as well. There was also demographic shift in players with female registration on Chess.com shifting from 22 to 27 of new players. GM Maurice Ashley said boom is taking place in chess like we have never seen maybe since the Bobby Fischer days attributing the growth to an increased desire to do something constructive during the pandemic. USCF Women 's Program Director Jennifer Shahade stated that chess works well on the internet since pieces do not need to be reset and matchmaking is virtually instant. Computer chess The idea of creating chess-playing machine dates to the 18th century around 1769 the chess-playing automaton called The Turk became famous before being exposed as hoax. Serious trials based on automata such as El Ajedrecista were too complex and limited to be useful. Since the advent of the digital computer in the 1950s chess enthusiasts computer engineers and computer scientists have built with increasing degrees of seriousness and success chess-playing machines and computer programs. The groundbreaking paper on computer chess Programming Computer for Playing Chess was published in 1950 by Claude Shannon. He wrote The chess machine is an ideal one to start with since the problem is sharply defined both in allowed operations the moves and in the ultimate goal checkmate it is neither so simple as to be trivial nor too difficult for satisfactory solution chess is generally considered to require thinking for skillful play solution of this problem will force us either to admit the possibility of mechanized thinking or to further restrict our concept of thinking the discrete structure of chess fits well into the digital nature of modern computers. The Association for Computing Machinery ACM held the first major chess tournament for computers the North American Computer Chess Championship in September 1970. CHESS 3.0 chess program from Northwestern University won the championship. The first World Computer Chess Championship held in 1974 was won by the Soviet program Kaissa. At first considered only curiosity the best chess playing programs have become extremely strong. In 1997 computer won chess match using classical time controls against reigning World Champion for the first time IBM 's Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov 3½–2½ it scored two wins one loss and three draws.

Adios Amigos (Ramones album),¡Adios Amigos. in Spanish Goodbye Friends is the fourteenth and final studio album by American punk rock band Ramones. It was released on July 18 1995 through Radioactive Records. The Ramones disbanded year after its release and subsequent tour.,¡Adios Amigos. in Spanish Goodbye Friends is the fourteenth and final studio album by American punk rock band Ramones. It was released on July 18 1995 through Radioactive Records. The Ramones disbanded year after its release and subsequent tour. Background The album was recorded at Baby Monster Studios in New York City and was the band 's third album on Radioactive Records after leaving Sire due to lack of significant sales and chart success. Relations within the band were strained due to Joey Ramone 's deteriorating health—having been diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma—Joey and Johnny Ramone decade-long feud and burgeoning rift between Marky and C.J. Long-time friend Daniel Rey was once again recruited to produce as he was liked by the entire band and knew how to provide comfortable pleasant experience for them in the studio. Composition and songs In his 2012 autobiography Commando Johnny Ramone awarded the album B+ grade stating Some of our albums would have three or four really strong songs and then the rest would be pretty weak. But on this one even the lesser stuff is decent. While bassist and songwriter Dee Dee Ramone had left the band following 1989 's Brain Drain ¡Adios Amigos. features six of his compositions including three previously released The Crusher was originally recorded for his 1989 debut solo album Standing in the Spotlight rap album released under the name Dee Dee King while Making Monsters for My Friends and It 's Not for Me to Know were originally recorded for the 1994 album Hate Freaks Like You which he performed with I.C.L.C. ¡Adios Amigos. also contains cover versions of Tom Waits Do n't Want to Grow Up and Johnny Thunders Love You. The American version of the album features hidden track Spiderman slightly different from the version the Ramones originally recorded for the Saturday Morning tribute album. The Japanese version and Captain Oi reissue of the album feature the bonus track R.A.M.O.N.E.S. originally recorded by Motörhead as tribute to the Ramones on their 1991 album 1916. Production and recording Johnny Ramone stated that ¡Adios Amigos. had perhaps the best of all the guitar sounds ever got C.J. Ramone sings lead vocals on the album tracks Makin Monsters for My Friends The Crusher Cretin Family and Scattergun as well as the bonus track R.A.M.O.N.E.S. Dee Dee Ramone makes his first appearance on Ramones album since 1989 during the bridge of the closing track Born to Die in Berlin singing in German and recorded via telephone. Artwork The album cover of ¡Adios Amigos which features two Allosaurus wearing sombreros is digitally altered version of painting by artist Mark Kostabi named Enasaurs which features the dinosaurs wearing yellow witch hats. Johnny Ramone added that the dinosaurs were what we felt like. Kostabi 's painting was in turn modified from painting by George Geselschap.The back cover shows the band tied and bound before being executed by firing squad. Johnny said that he stipulated that the band not be photographed from the front reasoning was very protective of how we looked at that point and some of us looked worse than others. He added had asked that they put the name of the record company on the backs of the firing squad executing us and they would n't go with that. The sleeping Mexican man seated next to the band is their longtime road manager Monte Melnick. Melnick explained They 'd always have Mexican sleeping on the floor in the old cowboy movies so they thought it 'd be nice touch. Shooting the back cover was gas. lot of people hate the front though. According to Melnick Marky Ramone loved the album due to Daniel Rey 's production but thought the cover was terrible. can relate to little bit 'cos felt like dinosaur said Johnny but do n't know where they fit in with the Mexican hats and all that. Melnick explained that several of the Ramones later album covers were designed by manager Gary Kurfirst with no input from the band due to dispute over merchandising royalties. Kurfirst was an art collector and would buy the art and stick it on the cover and figured it would increase the value of his painting. Reception Critical ¡Adios Amigos. received mixed to positive reviews and was viewed by many fans as return to form for the band. Evelyn McDonnell of Entertainment Weekly gave the album an A− stating their blitzkrieg bop not only has n't aged but is timelier than ever. In retrospective review for All Music Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album two and half stars out of five calling it an admirable way to bow out. He added that it recaptured some of the inspiration of Too Tough to Die and was an improvement upon their previous two albums Brain Drain and Mondo Bizarro but also veered close to self parody. Ultimately he concluded that it was the right way to call it day—it rocks and it rolls and it 's not an embarrassment. Commercial In contrast to the Ramones long-running inability to break through on singles charts the band 's cover of Tom Waits Do n't Want to Grow Up became minor hit for the group breaching the top 40 of Billboard 's Modern Rock Tracks chart and peaking at No. 30.

AVC English Alfaro Lives Dammit. another name for the Fuerzas Armadas Populares Eloy Alfaro English Eloy Alfaro Popular Armed Forces was clandestine left-wing group in Ecuador founded in 1982 and named after popular government leader and general Eloy Alfaro. The group was labeled as terrorist organization for the Ecuadorian state during the period of the former president León Febres Cordero existing between 1983 to 1991 years where they carried out various armed actions and criminal acts in Ecuador with Colombian influence M-19 and Nicaraguan Nicaraguan Revolution. The group was initially formed sometime in the 1970s but was not active militarily for the first few years of the 80's.An openly leftist organization but not Marxist they identified with the Democratic Left coalition. The AVC first received national attention in 1983 when it broke into museum and stole swords used by former president and leader of the liberal revolution Eloy Alfaro. Some of the group 's leaders were thought to be affiliated with Cuba Libya and Nicaragua and the group itself was linked to militant groups in other Latin American countries such as M-19 and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement establishing group of joint operations called America Battalion with these two groups.

The balance of the AVC campaign between 1983 and 1988 was 16 AVC members six members of the M-19 14 police officers killed more than 20 injured. Background AVC arose during an economic crisis in the 1980s. During the 1970s Ecuador experienced an annual economic growth rate of 8.1 due in part to high oil prices. In 1982 the economy stagnated due to the fall in the price of oil and the simultaneous rise in interest rates in international markets. The middle and upper classes were the ones who benefited the most from the oil boom but the popular classes were the ones who suffered the costs of the economic adjustment when the boom ended.Beginning with President Osvaldo Hurtado 1981-1984 the government of Ecuador applied measures dictated by the International Monetary Fund IMF to restructure the economy. These measures included reducing fiscal spending devaluing the local currency and raising prices. The Febres-Cordero government 1984-1988 exacerbated the economic crisis. With the lowest oil price ever recorded in 1986.His economic team was made up of three economists fully identified with the business sector Carlos Julio Emanuel Francisco Swett and Alberto Dahik. They devalued the Sucre promoting agricultural exports and favoring economic groups. At the same time they eliminated price controls and reduced the gasoline subsidy increasing the price of gasoline by 70 percent. The impact of the crisis on the popular sectors increased unemployment and the inflation and reduced consumption. The crisis was felt particularly in the poor sectors of the cities with an average fall in real urban income of 8.7 percent per year from 1981 to 1989 the most large among Latin American countries. Conformation AVC was formed mainly by middle-class students with an urban guerrilla focus. It formed part of other revolutionary organizations such as the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria MIR. The MIR had student leaders such as Fausto Basantes and Ricardo Merino of the Mejía National Institute of Quito Arturo Jarrin. and Hamet Vásconez from La Salle College of Quito currently La Salle-Conocoto Juan Cuvi and Juan Carlos Acosta from American College of Quito Edgar Frías from the José Joaquín de Olmedo School in Guayaquil. There were also alumni from the Colegio Nacional Juan Pío Montúfar Benalcázar and Cardenal Spellman schools in Quito.Arturo Jarrín entered the Central University of Ecuador in Quito to study sociology leaving it during his fourth year after participating in popular organization activities in the Ciudadela Ferroviaria de Quito he joined AVC becoming the leader of the organization being elected at The First AVC National Conference held in Esmeraldas in February 1983 attended by around 60 guerrillas. In it the Central Command formed by three people including Jarrín. Prior to this in January Jarrín and other guerrillas assaulted the Banco de Fomento. AVC called all bank robberies financial recoveries which were the organization 's primary means of financial support. Assaults The following is partial list of armed robberies of banking institutions carried out by AVC members with the respective amounts stolen. The amounts in US dollars are approximate with the price of the year in which they occurred. History The group was initially formed some time in the 1970s but was not militarily active for the first several years of its existence. An avowedly leftist but non-Marxist organisation they identified with the Democratic Left coalition. AVC first received national attention in 1983 when it broke into museum and stole swords which had been used by Eloy Alfaro. Some of the group 's leaders were thought to be affiliated with Cuba Libya and Nicaragua and the group itself was linked to militant groups from other Latin-American countries such as the M-19 and the Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement establishing joint operations group called America Battalion with these two groups. From 1986 to 1987 AVC carried out several kidnappings robbed banks and factory took over number of radio stations in order to broadcast their manifesto and killed four police officers while retrieving group member from police custody.In response to this activity the government began carrying out raids against the group. The group 's leader Arturo Jarrin was killed during shootout with government forces in October 1986. By 1987 large number of AVC 's leaders and members had either been killed or arrested. In 1989 the government of Ecuador reached an agreement with AVC with the group agreeing to end its violence. In 1991 the group officially reformed as legitimate political party. One year later eight group members made an illegal but non-violent entry into the British Embassy in Quito demanding the release of group leader who was then imprisoned by the Ecuadorian government. Robbery of the sword of Eloy Alfaro The first operation to receive extensive media coverage was the theft of the swords of Eloy Alfaro and Pedro José Montero from the Municipal Museum of Guayaquil on August 11. In January 2012 Rosa Mireya Cárdenas who served as Secretary of Peoples as delegate of former AVC members she returned the swords to the then President of Ecuador Rafael Correa. 1983-1985 Since the beginning of 1983 the AVC carried out large number of operations which included actions such as bank robberies and graffiti seeking in this way to achieve loudness in the media which according to the AVC were controlled by the right .The first National Conference is held between February 12 and 14 1983 in Tonsupa Esmeraldas where the Eloy Alfaro People 's Revolutionary Forces are constituted under the Slogan Alfaro Lives Dammit.

After the arrest of his sister and the threat of arrest of their parents by the police Jarrín confessed his identity his membership of the AVC and his participation in the robbery of Banco del Pacífico. Benavides for her part remained detained for months accused of illicit association. She was released on April 14 1985 after which she contacted the AVC in rural area of Esmeraldas.On August 10 the day that Febres-Cordero assumed the presidency of Ecuador the AVC took over several radio stations to announce its opposition to the incoming government.

Gameplay 2001 format Una vez en la vida The show featured 1,000 contestants packed into an arena who would play series of quiz minigames for the chance to play the final round where they would have the chance to win 210 000 000 by answering series of seven questions any mistakes would subtract from the cash prize. 2006 format ¡Allá tú. The program begins by each contestant being described by name and region usually the newest contestant to replace the one who played last episode receives special presentation and then they answer qualifying question usually about statistics i.e. What percentage of the Spanish elderly have used the Internet. 26 69. Out of those who answered correctly one is drawn who proceeds to the podium. Before the game begins the contestant picks one of the 22 boxes 26 cases for special episodes. Each box contains different amount of money from €0.10 to €300,000. In the main game the contestant 's objective is to find out what their box contains by removing the boxes of the other 21 contestants or 25 for specials when each box is selected the card with the box 's value on is shown to the camera before the value of the card is out of play and the display shows the amounts remaining. At various points in the game La Banca The Banker makes phone call to the host and makes the contestant cash offer to purchase their box and for the contestant to quit the game based on the value of the boxes left. The contestant can then decide whether to accept or decline the offer unlike most versions the contestant does not have to open or shield button. In the first round the contestant opens five boxes four in the second three in the third and then two each in the fourth fifth sixth and seventh. One player plays for the entire episode except for the million-euro specials which were longer and featured two players per episode. When their episode finishes new contestant replaces them in the wings. In 2005 the money values were modified slightly and the top prize was increased to €600,000 though the contestant 's winnings were split with phone-in contestant and taxed. Box/Case Values NOTE Some small values were often replaced with joke prizes except for the million euro specials. In 2011 Box 23 The Green Box could contain one of the following amounts References."

They traditionally speak the Nama language of the Khoe-Kwadi language family although many Nama also speak Afrikaans. The Nama People or Nama-Khoe people are the largest group of the Khoikhoi people most of whom have disappeared as group except for the Namas. Many of the Nama clans live in Central Namibia and the other smaller groups live in Namaqualand which today straddles the Namibian border with South Africa.,Nama in older sources also called Namaqua are an African ethnic group of South Africa Namibia and Botswana. They traditionally speak the Nama language of the Khoe-Kwadi language family although many Nama also speak Afrikaans. The Nama People or Nama-Khoe people are the largest group of the Khoikhoi people most of whom have disappeared as group except for the Namas. Many of the Nama clans live in Central Namibia and the other smaller groups live in Namaqualand which today straddles the Namibian border with South Africa. History For thousands of years the Khoisan peoples of South Africa and southern Namibia maintained nomadic life the Khoikhoi as pastoralists and the San people as hunter-gatherers. The Nama are Khoikhoi group. The Nama originally lived around the Orange River in southern Namibia and northern South Africa. The early colonialists referred to them as Hottentots. Their alternative historical name Namaqua stems from the addition of the Khoekhoe language suffix -qua/kwa meaning place of found in the names of other Southern African nations like the Griqua to the language name. Nama People partial ancestry from Khoikhoi People at the Cape Colony South Africa In April 1652 Jan van Riebeeck an official of the Dutch East India Company arrived at the Cape of Good Hope with 90 people to start initial Dutch settlement at the request of the company. They found the indigenous settlers called the Khoikhoi there who had settled in the Cape region at least thousand years before the Dutch arrived.The Khoikhoi at the Cape practiced pastoral farming they were the first pastoralists in Southern Africa. They lived beside the San people who were hunter-gathers. The Khoikhoi had lot of Nguni cattle and small livestock which they grazed around the Cape. The region was well suited to their lives as pastoralists because it provided enough water for them and their livestock.Initially when the Dutch made stop at the Cape on the way to the Indonesian archipelago they were concerned with getting fresh produce and water for their people. Indonesia was rich in crops and spices which could not be produced in Europe which is why the Dutch had major interest there. The Dutch had enslaved large number of Indonesians to work on their plantations. In the Cape Van Riebeek initially attempted to get cattle land and labour from the Khoikhoi people through negotiation but when these negotiations failed conflicts began to occur. The Dutch settlers waged wars against the Khoikoi and seized their lands to construct farms for wheat and other produce and forced many Khoikoi people to work as labourers. Their livestock was also taken and they were denied access to grazing and water resources unless they worked for the Dutch settlers.During the 18th and 19th centuries as conflicts intensified and Dutch settlement was expanding and taking up much space in the colony the expansion of the colony frontier pushed the Khoikhoi Eastwards into the Easternmost Cape the eventual closed frontier native reserves Transkei Ciskei and Northwards across the so-called open frontier Northern Cape South West Africa/Namibia. Some descendants of Khoikhoi communities including the Nama fled north of the colony and crossed the Orange River into German South West Africa present day Namibia .In 1991 part of Namaqualand home of the Nama and one of the last true wilderness areas of South Africa was named the Richtersveld National Park. In December 2002 ancestral lands including the park were returned to community ownership and the governments of South Africa and Namibia began creating trans-frontier park from the west coast of southern Africa to the desert interior absorbing the Richtersveld National Park. Today the Richtersveld National Park is one of the few places where the original Nama traditions survive. There the Nama move with the seasons and speak their language. The traditional Nama dwelling the |haru oms or portable rush-mat covered domed hut protects against the blistering sun and is easy to move when grazing becomes scarce. Nama People at German South West Africa Colony Namibia Some Khoikhoi groups including the Nama under the leadership of David Witbooi Hendrik Witbooi 's grandfather had crossed the Orange River into South West Africa. David Witbooi was the first Khoikhoi leader to establish permanent Namaqua settlement north Orange River beginning in the mid 1840s. In 1863 he eventually led his people to Gibeon south-central Namibia where he developed communialist society centered on cattle trade and Christianity. After his death in 1875 Moses Witbooi Hendrik Witbooi 's father assumed chieftaincy and remained in that position until 1883. Like his father Moses followed Christian practices and worked closely with Johannes Olpp Protestant missionary affiliated with Rheinische Missionsgesellschaft Rhenish Mission Society RMG who arrived in Gibeon in 1868. Moses supported Olpp 's efforts to build church and mission station and also helped found an RMG school in the settlement. ==== Conflicts between Nama people and Herero people ==== In June 1884 Hendrik Witbooi had taken over leadership from his father and in that year he began the first of his several treks with his people north into central Damaraland in search of new settlement. He had just resigned from his position in church as an elder year before 1883 he styled himself as biblical prophet and gained support of the most prominent families in Gibeon. Witbooi established settlement in Hoornkrans the very same year he moved from Gibeon. Hoornkrans was an important stronghold territory controlled by the Herero powerful Bantu pastoralists community led by Chief Maharero. Witbooi 's decision to expand his influence into Hoornkrans sparked protracted military conflict between the two tribes. However few months before the conflict began Maharero had finalized protection agreement with officials from the newly arrived German colonial administration. Although he knew about Maharero 's treaty with Germany Witbooi never waivered in his decision to confront the Herero people. Witbooi was campaigning for his tribe 's supremacy in the colony and he continued to clash with other tribal communities that were under the auspices of the German protection. These rivalries between the Nama people and other tribes posed significant problem for the imperial government because the Germans mandate for the colony was gradually being weakened. German leaders therefore sought to bring immediate end to the conflicts between Herero people and Witbooi Namaqua. ==== Nama-German Conflicts ==== In June 1886 Reichskomissar Göring wrote Witbooi encouraging him to end his hostile actions in the colony. He pleaded with the Nama Chief to return home to Gibeon to be with his father and tribe and live in peace there he warned that the German government could not allow chieftains who have placed themselves under German protection to support his ambition of driving protected chiefdom into war. Witbooi and his people ignored this warning and continued his campaign for dominance against the Herero. Later that same year Louis Nels deputy officer to Göering wrote to Witbooi inviting him to participate in conciliatory meeting between the various warring communities in Walvis Bay. With this meeting German authorities had hoped to facilitate peace treaty however the Namaqua chief did not comply with the request but instead he wrote letter in response telling Nels that he will not listen to him. He made it known to Nels that he Witbooi is chief of his tribe who is free and an autonomous man who answers only to God. The German officials did not respond to Witbooi 's diplomatic reproach. With the limits of German on full display imperial officials were at loss about how to end the violence in GSWA.In June 1888 Göring wrote Chancellor Otto Von Bismarck and described the overall situation as not very encouraging. April 1889 Göring went so far as to threaten open war against Witbooi and his tribe if he did not halt his attacks against groups allied with Germany. Witbooi 's resistance prompted policy makers to seek immediate solutions to the instability in GSWA. The Namaqua resistance provoked the German authorities to act decisively after 1889 Germany 's military presence in the colony began to grow exponentially. In March 1893 Chancellor Von Caprivi proclaimed GSWA German settlement colony. November same year Emperor Kaiser Wilhelm ɪɪ appointed Curt von François as Landeshauptmann. fanatic François looked at Witbooi with disdain and called him mere tribesman whom he could defeat easily. He had notion that his predecessors acted weakly in dealing with the Nama chief and they made too many concessions. François strongly believed that nothing but relentless severity would end Witbooi 's resistance decisively. Initially the German official tried to entice with an annual payment of five thousand marks if he would submit however the Nama chief maintained his stand.François was pressured by the Colonial Society to take action against Witbooi subsequently on April 12 1893 he launched surprise attack on Witbooi and his tribe at Hoornkrans. 214 soldiers had been sent with an ultimate objective to destroy the Witbooi Nama tribe. Though Witbooi and majority of his male soldiers escaped the encirclement German troops killed nearly one hundred Namaqua women and children in their sleep. The Namaqua were unprepared for the raid believing François was still committed to neutrality. Previously Hendrik had scrupulously avoided harming Germans but now was compelled to join the colonizers in war. In series of running skirmishes that lasted for more than year the Namaqua had great success stealing horses and livestock from the German headquarters in Windhoek. At the end of 1893 Theodor Leutwein replaced Von François he was appointed to the colony to investigate the reasons for continuing failure to subdue the Nama people. In July 1894 Leutwein asked for 250 troops with the enlarged army he was able to defeat the Nama people who at the time had run out of ammunition the English at the Cape and Walvis Bay had refused them assistance. Leiutwein successfully subdued the Nama and forced Hendrik to sign protection treaty. ==== Nama-Herero Genocide 1904-1908 ==== June 1904 Kaiser Wilhelm replaced Leutwein with Lieutenant General Lothar von Trotha like his predecessor von Trotha believed that violence would ultimately put an end to the wars in the colony. He employed policy of extermination of the whole African tribes in the colony. The Nama people are fighters in pre-colonial times the Namas and the Herero people fought for control of pastures in central Namibia. The battle continued for long part of the 19th century.From 1904 to 1908 the German Empire which had colonized present-day Namibia waged war against the Nama and the Herero group of Bantu pastoralists leading to the Herero and Namaqua genocide and large loss of life for both the Nama and Herero populations. This was motivated by the German desire to establish prosperous colony which required displacing the indigenous people from their agricultural land. Large herds of cattle were confiscated and Nama and Herero people were driven into the desert and in some cases interned in concentration camps on the coast for example at Shark Island. Additionally the Nama and Herero were forced into slave labor to build railways and to dig for diamonds during the diamond rush.In the 1920s diamonds were discovered at the mouth of the Orange River and prospectors began moving there establishing towns at Alexander Bay and Port Nolloth. This accelerated the appropriation of traditional lands that had begun early in the colonial period. Under apartheid remaining pastoralists were encouraged to abandon their traditional lifestyle in favour of village life.At the dawn of the 19th century Oorlam people encroached into Namaqualand and Damaraland. They likewise descended from indigenous Khoikhoi but were group with mixed ancestry including Europeans and slaves from Madagascar India and Indonesia. After two centuries of assimilation into the Nama culture many Oorlams today regard Khoikhoigowab Damara/Nama as their mother tongue though others speak Afrikaans. The distinction between Namas and Oorlams has gradually disappeared over time to an extent where they are today regarded as one ethnic group despite their different ancestries. Clans ǀKhowesen Direct descendants of Captain Hendrik Witbooi who was killed in the battle with Germans on 29 October 1905. The |Khowesin reside in modern-day Gibeon under the leadership of Ismael Hendrik Witbooi the 9th Gaob meaning captain of the |Khowesen Gibeon situated 72 km south of Mariental and 176 km north of Keetmanshoop just off the B1 was originally known by the name Khaxa-tsûs. It received its name from Kido Witbooi first Kaptein of the ǀKhowesin. Khaiǁkhaun Red Nation at Hoachanas the main group and the oldest Nama clan in Namibia ǃGamiǂnun Bondelswarts at Warmbad ǂAonin Topnaars at Utuseb and Rooibank ǃKharakhoen Fransman Nama at Gochas. After being defeated by Imperial Germany 's Schutztruppe in the Battle of Swartfontein on 15 January 1905 this Nama group split into two. Part of the ǃKharakhoen fled to Lokgwabe Botswana and stayed there permanently the part that remained on South West African soil relocated their tribal centre to Amper-Bo. In 2016 David Hanse was inaugurated as chief of the clan. ǁHawoben Veldschoendragers at Koës Aman at Bethanie which was led by Cornelius Frederick ǁOgain Groot Doden at Schlip ǁKhauǀgoan Swartbooi Nama at Rehoboth later at Salem Ameib and Franzfontein The Kharoǃoan Keetmanshoop Nama under the leadership of Hendrik Tseib split from the Red Nation in February 1850 and settled at Keetmanshoop. Culture In general the Nama practice policy of communal land ownership. Music poetry and story telling are very important in Nama culture and many stories have been passed down orally through the generations. The Nama have culture that is rich in the musical and literary abilities of its people. Traditional music folk tales proverbs and praise poetry have been handed down for generations and form the base for much of their culture. They are known for crafts which include leatherwork skin karosses and mats musical instruments such as reed flutes jewellery clay pots and tortoiseshell powder containers. Many of the Nama people in South Namibia have lost their lands during German colonialism. New Namibian minister of land reform Uutoni Nujoma has been accused of preferring other Namibians from other regions over native Namas. Dress The traditional dress of Nama women consists of long formal dresses that resemble Victorian traditional fashion. The long flowing dresses were developed from the style of the missionaries in the 1800s and this traditional clothing is today an integral part of the Nama nation 's culture. Habitation The Nama people 's hut or also called matjieshuis is round hut traditionally made of beautifully designed reed mats on skeleton of sticks. It corresponds to their nomadic life of the past matjieshuis is still part of the life of the inhabitants of Richtersveld region made up of mountainous deserts in the north-west of South Africa. In fact this is the last place where we can still find them in significant numbers.In the villages currently in the Richtersveld the matjieshuise are used as depot to store as kitchen as an additional place to sleep or even to provide to tourists like accommodation. These huts called haru oms in the Nama language are made of reed mats woven neatly into beehive shape. It is dwelling house for all seasons it is cool and well ventilated in summer it is naturally insulated by reed carpets in winter and protected from the rain by the porous stems which swell with water. All materials are organic and not over-harvested this is home that truly respects the environment. Women and men take part in the making in the collection of materials in the preparation of the rugs and in the assembly of the hut in meticulous and meticulous process which has remained true Nama art. Settlements Traditionally Nama camps had 5-30 huts. These huts were circular domes and their doors faced the center of camp. They were also arranged hierarchically the chief was placed west and faced east. Other families were placed based on their seniority Elder brothers and their families were on the far right while younger brothers and their families on the left. There are no enclosures for adult livestock. They are expected to sleep in front of their owners huts. Calves and lambs are placed in an enclosed area in the middle of camp. The huts were lined with reed mats made by women. The mats are placed on wooden frames. The reeds are able to soak and absorb water well thus being able to protect the Nama people from summer rains. These Huts are very mobile but also stable being able to break them down in less than an hour. The huts are also reusable. Religion They have largely abandoned their traditional religion through the sustained efforts of Christian and now Muslim proselytisers. The majority of the Nama people in Namibia today are therefore Christian while Nama Muslims make up large percentage of Namibia 's Muslims. Burials In the past funerals were not big social gathering. The Nama people simply buried the body and never spoke about the person again due to fear of spirits. Today funerals are social solidarity. The position of the person in the community being buried matters that determines the burial site. Members of close relatives of the deceased person spend week preparing the grave site digging and using flattened oil drums as sheets. The actual mourning takes place three days before the actual burial. During the first two night of the mourning there is singing of hymns preaching and praying. On the last day of the mourning and the day of the burial there are speeches presented and messages of condolences. The grave site itself is lined with brick and once the body is inside wooden board is laid upon the top before it is covered with dirt. This style of the burial site makes it easy for preservation of the body. Wedding ritual Namas have complicated wedding ritual. First the man has to discuss his intentions with his family. If they agree they will advise him of the customs to ask the bride 's family and then accompany him to the place she lives. The yard at the bride 's living place is prepared prior to the future husband 's family 's arrival animal hides are laid out in the corners for the different groups to sit down and discuss.The groom 's family ask for the gate to be opened. If this is granted the groom is interrogated about details of the bride including the circumstances of their first meeting and how to identify her body marks to make sure both know each other well. If the bride is pregnant or already has children from her future husband or someone else the bride is subjected to the door cleansing ceremony slaughtering and consuming snow-white goat. After several days the wedding ritual continues in reverse the bride 's family visits the clan of the groom. If all is to the satisfaction of the two clans an engagement day is announced.At the engagement the groom 's family brings live animals to the woman 's family home. The animals are slaughtered hung on three sticks and each part is offered to the bride 's family. Other items like bags of sugar or flour are only offered in quantities of two or four to indicate that there will always be abundance of food. This process is also celebrated in reverse at the man 's family home. White flags are mounted on both families houses which may not be taken off but wither or are blown off by the wind one day.The wedding preparations can take up to one year. The family of the groom makes gift to the bride 's mother traditionally cow and calf for she has raised the bride at her breast. bargaining process accompanies the gift that can take weeks in itself. On wedding day both families provide animals and other food and bring it to the bride 's home. The wedding itself takes place in church. Festivities afterward go on for several days. The first night after the wedding the couple spends separately. On the next morning they set off for their own home. See also Democratic Action for Namas References Literature Hoernlé A.

Tie Me Down. Spanish ¡Átame pronounced ˈa.ta.me Tie Me. is 1989 Spanish dark romantic comedy film co-written and directed by Pedro Almodóvar starring Victoria Abril and Antonio Banderas alongside Loles Léon Francisco Rabal Julieta Serrano María Barranco and Rossy de Palma.

The film was highly successful with both critics and audiences in Spain. Its United States release was entangled in controversy instrumental in the implementation by the MPAA of new rating category NC-17 for films of an explicit nature that were previously unfairly regarded as pornographic because of the rating. Plot Ricky 23-year-old psychiatric patient has been deemed cured and is released from mental institution. Until then he has been the lover of the woman director of the hospital. An orphan free and alone his goal is to have normal life with Marina Osorio an actress former porn star and recovering drug addict whom he once slept with during an escape from the asylum. Ricky discovers Marina 's whereabouts from film journal announcement of the start of her next film. He goes to the studio where Marina is in her last day at work filming The Midnight Phantom Euro-horror film about hideously mutilated masked muscleman in love with Marina 's character. The film is directed by Máximo Espejo an old film director confined to wheelchair after stroke. Máximo is gentle mentor to Marina and threatens to throw out journalist who mentions the words porn and junkie in Marina 's presence. His protection of the actress is not completely innocent since he is sexually attracted to Marina enjoying what could be his last experience of directing sexy female lead. When Ricky comes to the set he steals few necessary items including the keys to Marina 's apartment and before long he is an unwelcome presence in her life. Ricky with long-haired wig does handstand to try to capture her attention but Marina does not remember him and quickly dismisses him. After filming the last scene Marina goes home to change for the post-shoot party. Ricky follows her to her apartment. When she answers the door Ricky forces his way in. He grabs her and headbutts her to silence her when she screams he tapes her mouth and binds her with rope. Marina wakes with terrible toothache which normal painkillers do not relieve as she is addicted to stronger drugs. Ricky explains that he has captured her so that when she gets to know him better she will fall in love and they will get married and have children. Marina declares she will never love him understandably enraged at being handcuffed gagged and lashed to the bed. However Ricky remains determined to win her heart. Marina is shocked and in pain and eventually persuades Ricky to take her to doctor who can give her the necessary painkillers. Ricky barely leaves her alone with the doctor and she is unable to communicate her plight. They can not obtain the drugs in the pharmacy so Ricky goes off to buy them on the black market. However rather than paying the street price he attacks the dealer to steal the tablets. During the wrap party Marina 's sister Lola who is the assistant director of The Midnight Phantom steals the show with musical number. Increasingly worried about her sister 's disappearance Lola visits Marina 's apartment and leaves note. To avoid being discovered Ricky moves Marina to her next door neighbor 's apartment which is empty but the owner has left his keys with Lola so she can water his plants while he is away during the summer. In the street again Ricky is spotted by the dealer who he had attacked. Ricky is then seriously beaten robbed and left unconscious. During his absence Marina makes desperate but somewhat half-hearted attempt to escape from her captivity. However when Ricky returns covered with blood and cuts she sees his vulnerability and devotion to her no matter how misguided. She cares for him cleaning and sterilizing his wounds and is suddenly struck by the realization that she has fallen in love with her captor. They make love at length and Ricky seems to be on the verge of achieving his aim. They decide to take trip together to his native village. When he is about to leave to steal car for the trip Marina who still considers herself his prisoner tells him to keep her tied up so that she will not try to escape. However in Ricky 's absence Lola re-enters the apartment and discovers Marina tied up and rescues her. Marina informs her sister that she is in love with her captor. Lola is astonished to learn that Marina really no longer wants to be rescued but once convinced she agrees to drive Marina to Ricky 's birthplace. They find him there in the ruins of his family house in deserted village then the three climb into Lola 's car to return to the city. Lola promises Ricky she will find him job within the week Marina begins to cry and they drive off together into the distance singing like normal family. Cast Production Casting Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. marked Almodóvar 's breaking-up with his longtime star Carmen Maura in rift that took many years to heal. In any case at the age of 44 Maura was too old to play the protagonist role that demanded younger actress. The film was the beginning of fruitful collaboration with Victoria Abril whom Almodóvar had previously considered for the role of Cristal the prostitute neighbor in What Have Done to Deserve This. 1984 and Candela the model fleeing relationship with terrorist in Women on the Verge of Nervous Breakdown 1988. Abril had cameo role in Law of Desire and was already well-established actress identified with strong female characters.The male lead was played by Banderas in his fifth and most important collaboration with Almodóvar. His role in Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. launched his career in American films. Loles Léon stand-up comedian plays Marina 's sassy sister Lola. She had previously appeared as the meddlesome telephonist in Women on the Verge of Nervous Breakdown. Francisco Rabal one of Spain 's foremost actors took the role of the film director. Almodóvar cast his own mother Francisca Caballero as Marina 's mother. Rossy de Palma the actress of Picassoesque appearance discovered by Almodóvar in 1986 plays the small role of the drug dealer. Analysis The Spanish title ¡Átame. literally means Tie Me Up. while the second part of the English title Tie Me Down. is presumably intended to suggest the idea of lasting relationship. Almodóvar has consistently denied that the ropes within Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. have any links with sadomasochism. There is no erotic charge to the ropes and gags. He explained 'Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. is essentially love story or rather story of how someone attempts to construct love story in the same way as he might study for degree by means of effort will power and persistence ... when you have nothing like my main character you have to force everything. Including love. Ricky has only as the flamenco singers say the night the day and the vitality of an animal. Ricky 's stated ambition is to be good husband to Marina and good father to their children. Indeed the relationship between Marina and Ricky is meant ultimately to be parody of how such relationships work as if heterosexuality and its consequence marriage are almost inevitably equivalent in character to the infamous Stockholm syndrome. The cords that tie us one to another become literal ropey metaphors in the film. It is tale not of kinky sex but of sweeter human bondage of loose ends tied into lover 's knots. Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. follows in the myth of Beauty and the Beast and the notion that the savagery of the Beast is in the presence of Beauty tamed by gentler feelings. This has been recurrent theme in films such as King Kong 1933 Tarzan the Ape Man 1932 and Frankenstein 1931. This theme is also present in Spanish Literature. In the play Life Is Dream by Calderon de la Barca the main character is Segismundo half-man half-beast who has been imprisoned for his whole twenty years once released into the world he finds that his violence is tamed by female beauty.The abduction narrative of Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. has some similarities with the film The Collector 1965 directed by William Wyler in which butterfly specialist abducts young woman in order to add her to his collection. The Collector was adapted from the eponymous novel by John Fowles. In style theme and plot details however Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. differs greatly from Wyler 's film and the novel that inspired it. Bride kidnapping is also central plot device in the Hollywood musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers 1954. Genre Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. combines two different film genres romantic comedy and horror film. In spite of some dark elements it can be described as romantic comedy and the director 's clearest love story. Almodóvar described the film as romantic fairy tale. Ricky in his violent courtship of Marina follows in an exaggerated manner the path of the romantic film genre like those made popular in the late 1950s by Doris Day with various male film stars Pillow Talk 1959 with Rock Hudson Move Over Darling 1963 with James Garner and That Touch of Mink 1962 with Cary Grant.Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. is also rooted on the tradition of the horror film genre. Marina plays the lead in the horror film The Midnight Phantom in which she defeats the Phantom 's attempt to kill her overcoming him and thus subverting the horror film tradition of woman as victim in way that parallels Marina 's relationship with Ricky. While filming The Midnight Phantom Lola notes that the film they are working on is 'more love story than horror story to which Maximo the director replies sometimes they 're indistinguishable. The Midnight Phantom is not simply film within the film just as the girl in The Midnight Phantom defeats the monster so ultimately Marina will succeed in taming Ricky. In way Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. is an extension of The Midnight Phantom and both films mix variant versions of Beauty and the Beast that are within the genres of horror and romance. Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. also makes reference to two horror films Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956 and Night of the Living Dead 1968. Máximo has poster of the former in his editing room and Marina watches the latter while Ricky is away. Music The soundtrack was composed by Ennio Morricone in the style of thriller and is reminiscent of Bernard Herrmann 's score for Alfred Hitchcock 's Psycho 1960. Almodóvar admired Morricone 's soundtracks for westerns but found the music for Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. conventional and uninspiring too similar to Morricone 's work for the film Frantic and used only half of Morricone 's music.Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. prominently features two songs. The film closes with the theme Resistire Will Resist by Dúo Dinámico Spanish pop duo from the 1960s suggesting Marina 's happy resistance to Ricky 's unconventional courtship. The wrap party scene breaks the hardship of the kidnapping scene. It presents Marina 's sister Lola played by Loles León singing the bolero Canción del Alma song popularized in Latin America by Alfredo Sadel. Reception Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down Almodóvar 's eighth film was completed in late 1989. Its premiere at the Berlin Film Festival in early 1990 was inauspicious. The projector broke down and in the following press conference Almodóvar whose films have not been well understood in Germany was subjected to heavy questioning about his homosexuality drug abuse and the Spanishness of his film.Released in Spain in January 1990 Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. was an enormous success becoming the highest-grossing domestic film of its year reaching an audience of over million. It had twice the audience of the most critically acclaimed Spanish film of that year Carlos Saura 's ¡Ay Carmela film starring Almodóvar 's former muse Carmen Maura. The film was generally well received by the Spanish critics. Lluis Bonet writing in La Vanguardia called the film terrible tender love story agreeing with the director that the best scene was that in which Marina initially held hostage by Ricky against her will finally asks to be tied up by him so she will not be tempted to flee from the love he has successfully provoked in her. Critic Javier Maqua in Cinco Días called Marina 's request evidence of the greatest intensity of love. Rosy de Palma who plays drug dealer in the film explained that the film 's kidnapping was not to be imitated in real life and was only justified by the exceptional nature of the characters .British critics took time to warm up to Almodóvar 's films and dismissed Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. Lawrence O'Toole of Sight and Sound described it as fairly banal schematic and essentially humorless .In the United States the film was met with opposition from rating agencies and the public due to lengthy sex scene and two sequences in which Marina and later her sister Lola sit on the toilet to urinate. Particularly controversial was the shot of Marina in bath tub pleasuring herself with scuba diver toy. Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. was entangled in rating classification battle and was the subject of heated debate. Eventually released unrated the film was decried by feminists and women 's advocacy groups for its sadomasochist overtones and portrayal of successful female abduction and abuse. Modern audiences have criticized Almodóvar for ... condon ing Ricky 's behavior suggesting that it 's okay to brutalize and subjugate woman so long as one is allegedly motivated by sincere passion. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 68 based on 31 reviews with an average score of 6.10/10. The site 's critics consensus reads Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. undermines its own effectiveness with an excess of camp but writer-director Pedro Almodóvar and an attractive cast make it all worth watching. The film grossed 4,087,361 at the North American box office. Controversy There was legal battle over the decision by the Motion Picture Association of America MPAA which determines film ratings in the United States to give Tie Me Up. Tie Me Down. an rating which was normally reserved for pornography. This marginalized its distribution and reduced its chance of box-office success. Miramax the film 's distribution company in North America filed lawsuit against the MPAA over the rating. When the case came to court in New York it gave rise to general debate on cinema censorship and sexuality in the United States.The attorney for Miramax claimed that the AAP Average American Parent was not well served by system that was lenient on films with hard violence and drug use while being harsh with films depicting sex. Miramax lost its case in court and the film was ultimately released unrated. However numerous other filmmakers had complained about the rating given to their films and in September 1990 the MPAA dropped the rating and replaced it with the NC-17 rating with Henry June as the first film released with the new rating. This was especially helpful to films of an explicit nature that were previously assumed to be pornographic because of the rating. Home video Tie Me Up.

The film stars Carmen Maura Andrés Pajares and Gabino Diego as trio of travelling players performing for the Republic who inadvertently find themselves on the nationalist side during the closing months of the Spanish Civil War. The film was selected as the Spanish entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 63rd Academy Awards but was not accepted as nominee. Plot Carmela Paulino and Gustavete who is mute as the result of an explosion are trio of travelling vaudeville performers. Amidst the chaos of the Spanish Civil War they are in the town of Montejo entertaining republican troops with their variety show. They are survivors who are motivated not exactly by patriotism but by desire for self-preservation. Their show consists of four acts. It begins with Carmela singing and dancing traditional song. The audience is enthusiastic during her performance but the mood changes completely when the sound of approaching nationalist planes is heard. As the planes fly overhead Paulino reads poem by Antonio Machado which introduces note of patriotic fervour in accordance with republican feeling in 1938. The seriousness of the moment is followed by comic routine in which Paulino twists himself into variety of ridiculous postures in an attempt to break wind. The fourth and final act is 'tableau vivant in which Carmela represents justice while Paulino brandishes the republican flag and they sing song of freedom. The dangers and deprivation that they encounter in the republican side encourage the trio to go to Valencia. To obtain gasoline for the trip Carmela has to distract republican truck driver while Paulino and Gustavete steal the fuel. They make this difficult journey on misty night and inadvertently end up in nationalist territory. They are detained by nationalist officer and are incriminated by the republican flag they carry amongst their props. They are arrested and taken as prisoners to the local school which serves as prison camp where the republicans are held. Carmela befriends fellow prisoner Polish soldier member of the International Brigade and is surprised that he has come to fight in Spain foreign land whose name he can not even pronounce. In an atmosphere of mounting tension and terror some of the prisoners are taken away to be shot. Carmela Paulino and Gustavete are driven away in an army car. They are convinced that they are also going to be killed but instead they are taken to the local theatre where they meet an Italian officer Lieutenant Amelio di Ripamonte. Surprisingly the lieutenant learning that they are performers wants them to take part in show he has been planning to entertain the nationalist troops. They must stage burlesque of the Republic in exchange for their freedom. For the variety show that they are to perform to the nationalists Paulino rewrites their old script. From the outset the fiery and patriotic Carmela is defiant and unwilling to go along with it displaying her true convictions as an anti-fascist. However Paulino persuades her that since their lives are at stake she must collaborate in the performance of the now anti-republican numbers. On the day of the show both artists are indisposed as Carmela has her period and Paulino has an upset stomach from eating rabbit which Gustavete writing on his slate now confirms to have been cat. The presence of the Polish prisoners who have been brought to witness mockery of their ideals greatly upsets Carmela and she initially refuses to perform number involving the republican flag. Structurally the show is largely similar to the one they used to perform for the republican troops. Musical numbers are followed by poem now read by the lieutenant. The third act involves comic sketch The Republic goes to the Doctor. In this simplistic parody Paulino plays gay republican doctor who is visited by female patient the Spanish Republic played by Carmela. She claims that she has been made pregnant by Russian lover played by Gustavete. In number which gives full scope to all the possible sexual innuendos the audience cares to imagine Carmela invites the doctor to insert his thermometer in her to which he refuses making the excuse that it is broken. Carmela increasingly irritated by the mockery of the Republic and enervated by the presence of the Polish soldiers gradually loses heart in her performance and her frustration at the mockery of the ideals she holds dear seethes to the surface jeopardizing the credibility of the parody. The sketch quickly disintegrates as the Polish soldiers begin to rebel in the galleries and the fascists become infuriated. The scene comes to climax as Carmela starts singing 'Ay Carmela and lowers the republican flag to expose her breasts in defiance of the earlier cries of 'Whore. from the audience. nationalist officer then emerges from the stalls raises pistol and shoots Carmela in the forehead. Gustavete suddenly recovers his voice calling out in anguish but Carmela falls to the floor dead. The next scene shows Paulino and Gustavete visiting Carmela 's rudimentary grave which they decorate with flowers and the latter 's chalk board now redundant since Gustavete regained his voice when Carmela was shot. The only words here are spoken by Gustavete Come on Paulino as he leads him away. The two men take to the road again and the song ¡Ay Carmela. rises in the background closing the film as it had begun and taking it into the credits. Cast Carmen Maura as Carmela Andrés Pajares as Paulino Gabino Diego as Gustavete Mauricio De Razza as Lieutenant Ripamonte José Sancho as Captain Production Made in 1990 ¡Ay Carmela. was director Carlos Saura twenty-third feature-length film and in his own words the first in which he was able to treat the subject of the Civil War with any kind of humour would have been incapable few years ago of treating our war with humour… but now it is different for sufficient time has passed to adopt broader perspective and here there is no doubt that by employing humour it is possible to say things that it would be more difficult if not impossible to say in another way .In Saura 's earlier films allusions to the war and to its consequences were characterized by violence and brutality and if there was any humour at all it was grim and ironic. Despite the fact that the action in ¡Ay Carmela. is set fully in the War Saura 's treatment of it employs comic effects including farce.The film is based on the play of the same name by the Valencian dramatist José Sanchís Sinisterra. The play was success in Spain and was translated to English and staged in London. The play focuses entirely on the two principal characters Carmela and Paulino and tells their story largely in flashback. When it begins Paulino is alone and depressed for Carmela is already dead the victim of fascist bullet at their last performance as variety artist. In the first part of the play Carmela returns as ghost to converse with Paulino blaming him for all that has happened and in the second part evokes in detail the fatal performance. The play contains only two characters and single setting. Saura adapted the play with the help of scriptwriter Rafael Azcona who had worked with him many times before but with whom he had broken in 1975 prior to the making of Cria Cuervos.Saura opened up the story and presented it not in flashback but in linear manner. This allowed Saura to follow the journey of Carmela and Paulino during the two days in which they travel from Republican to Nationalist territory performing their act in both camps. It also allowed much more scope for the relationship and the characters of Carmela and Paulino to evolve and in relation to the events in which they find themselves caught up. It also enable Saura to depict other characters and locations which are mentioned in the play in particular Gustavette the traveling companion of Carmela and Paulino and the Italian officer and theatre director Lieutenant Amelio di Ripamonte. The town where the action occurs and the theatre in which the final third of the film is located are also depicted. Some artistic resonance evoke memories of Ernst Lubitsch 's 1942 comedy To Be or Not to Be.The film takes its title from the song Ay Carmela which begins and ends the film. Originally song from the War of Independence against Napoleon it had been adapted and became the favourite song of the Republican soldiers and of the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.

DuckDuckGo does not show search results from content farms.

Because of its anonymity it is impossible to know how many people use DuckDuckGo.The company is based in Paoli Pennsylvania in Greater Philadelphia and had 200 employees as of November 2022. The company name is reference to the children 's game duck duck goose. History DuckDuckGo was founded by Gabriel Weinberg and launched on February 29 2008 in Valley Forge Pennsylvania. Weinberg is an entrepreneur who previously launched Names Database now-defunct social network. Initially self-funded by Weinberg until October 2011 it was then backed by Union Square Ventures and handful of angel investors. Union Square partner Brad Burnham stated We invested in DuckDuckGo because we became convinced that it was not only possible to change the basis of competition in search it was time to do it. In addition Trisquel Linux Mint and the Midori web browser switched to use DuckDuckGo as their default search engine. DuckDuckGo gains revenue via advertisements and affiliate programs. The search engine is written in Perl and runs on nginx FreeBSD and Linux. DuckDuckGo is built primarily upon search APIs from various vendors. Because of this TechCrunch characterized the service as hybrid search engine. Weinberg explained the beginnings of the name with respect to the children 's game duck duck goose. He said of the origin of the name Really it just popped in my head one day and just liked it. It is certainly influenced/derived from duck duck goose but other than that there is no relation e.g. metaphor. DuckDuckGo was featured on TechCrunch 's Elevator Pitch Friday in 2008 and it was finalist in the 2008 BOSS Mashable Challenge.In 2010 DuckDuckGo began using privacy to differentiate itself from its competitors.In July 2010 Weinberg started DuckDuckGo community website duck.co to allow the public to report problems discuss means of spreading the use of the search engine request features and discuss open sourcing the code. The company registered the domain name ddg.gg on February 22 2011 and acquired duck.com in December 2018 which are used as shortened URL aliases that redirect to duckduckgo.com. By May 2012 the search engine was attracting 1.5 million searches day. Weinberg reported that it had earned US 115,000 in revenue in 2011 and had three employees plus small number of contractors. Compete.com estimated 266,465 unique visitors to the site in February 2012. On April 12 2011 Alexa reported 3-month growth rate of 51. DuckDuckGo 's own traffic statistics show that in August 2012 there were 1,393,644 visits per day up from an average of 39,406 visits per day in April 2010 the earliest data available. In lengthy profile in November 2012 The Washington Post indicated that searches on DuckDuckGo numbered up to 45,000,000 per month in October 2012. The article concluded Weinberg 's non-ambitious goals make him particularly odd and dangerous competitor online. He can do almost everything that Google or Bing ca n't because it could damage their business models and if users figure out that they like the DuckDuckGo way better Weinberg could damage the big boys without even really trying. It 's asymmetrical digital warfare and his backers at Union Square Ventures say Google is vulnerable. GNOME released Web 3.10 on September 26 2013 and starting with this version the default search engine is DuckDuckGo.At its keynote speech at WWDC 2014 on September 18 2014 Apple announced that DuckDuckGo would be included as an option for search on both iOS and OS Yosemite in its Safari browser. On March 10 the Pale Moon web browser starting with version 24.4.0 included DuckDuckGo as its default search engine as well as listed it on the browser 's homepage. In May 2014 DuckDuckGo released redesigned version to beta testers through DuckDuckHack. On May 21 2014 DuckDuckGo officially released the redesigned version that focused on smarter answers and more refined look. The new version added many new features such as images local search auto-suggest weather recipes and more.On November 10 2014 Mozilla added DuckDuckGo as search option to Firefox 33.1. On May 30 2016 The Tor Project Inc made DuckDuckGo the default search engine for Tor Browser 6.0.In July 2016 DuckDuckGo officially announced the extension of its partnership with Yahoo. that brought new features to all users of the search engine including date filtering of results and additional site links. It also partners with Bing Yandex and Wikipedia to produce results or make use of features offered. The company also confirmed that it does not share user information with partner companies as has always been its policy.On January 23 2018 DuckDuckGo revamped its browser extension and mobile app in an effort to keep Internet users safe beyond the search box. The revamped extension and app include tool for rating websites based on their use of encryption and ad-tracking networks as well as the ability to block ad-tracking networks. The extension also provides Terms of service summaries from Terms of Service Did n't Read.In December 2018 it was reported that Google transferred ownership of the domain name Duck.com to DuckDuckGo. It is not known what price if any DuckDuckGo paid for the domain name.On January 15 2019 DuckDuckGo announced that all map and address-related searches would be powered by Apple Maps both on desktop and mobile devices.In March 2019 Google added DuckDuckGo to the default search engine list in Chrome 73.In July 2021 DuckDuckGo introduced its email forwarding feature Email Protection which lets users claim an duck.com email address generated by the service. That inbox will receive emails and strip them of data trackers before forwarding them to the user 's private email address. The feature launched in beta for users of the DuckDuckGo iOS and Android apps.As of March 2022 it had 102,704,358 daily searches on average.On March 2022 in response to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine DuckDuckGo paused its partnership with Yandex Search. On March 2022 Weinberg said in tweet that DuckDuckGo will down-rank sites associated with Russian disinformation move which some users criticized as censorship and violation of the search engine 's commitment to unbiased search. DuckDuckGo has defended itself from the criticism saying that The primary utility of search engine is to provide access to accurate information. Disinformation sites that deliberately put out false information to intentionally mislead people directly cut against that utility. In April 2022 TorrentFreak reported that DuckDuckGo had blocked search results for some major pirating websites including The Pirate Bay 1337x and FMovies as well as video downloading software Youtube-dl. In statement to Engadget DuckDuckGo said that The Pirate Bay and Youtube-dl were never removed from its search results if the user searched for those websites using their name or web address. DuckDuckGo also said that there were problems with site search queries used for these websites and other searches and said that the problem had been fixed.Also in April DuckDuckGo said that they would protect users from being tracked by Google 's Accelerated Mobile Pages framework stating When you load or share Google AMP page anywhere from DuckDuckGo apps iOS/Android/Mac or extensions Firefox/Chrome the original publisher 's webpage will be used in place of the Google AMP version .In May 2022 report from Bleeping Computer by security researcher Zach Edwards found that DuckDuckGo 's web browser allowed Microsoft 's trackers to continue running while visiting non-DuckDuckGo websites contrary to Google and Facebook trackers which were blocked. In response Weinberg said that this issue is occurring on browsers and only pertains to non-DuckDuckGo websites. adding that When you load our search results you are completely anonymous including ads and that Unfortunately our Microsoft search syndication agreement prevent us from doing more to Microsoft-owned properties. However we have been continually pushing and expect to be doing more soon. adding that What we 're talking about here is an above-and-beyond protection that most browsers do n't even attempt to do that is blocking third-party tracking scripts before they load on 3rd party websites. Because we 're doing this where we can users are still getting significantly more privacy protection with DuckDuckGo than they would using Safari Firefox and other browsers. Features Search results DuckDuckGo 's results are compilation of over 400 sources according to itself including Bing Yahoo. Search BOSS Wolfram Alpha Yandex and its own web crawler the DuckDuckBot but none from Google. It also uses data from crowdsourced sites such as Wikipedia to populate knowledge panel boxes to the right of the search results.Weinberg has refined the quality of his search engine results by deleting search results for companies he believes are content mills such as eHow which publishes 4,000 articles per day produced by paid freelance writers which Weinberg states to be low-quality content designed specifically to rank highly in Google 's search index. DuckDuckGo also filters pages with substantial advertising. Instant Answers In addition to the indexed search results DuckDuckGo displays relevant results called instant answers on top of the search page. These Instant Answers are collected from either third party APIs or static data sources like text files. The Instant Answers are called zeroclickinfo because the intention behind these is to provide what users are searching for on the search result page itself so that they do not have to click any results to find what they are looking for. Instant answers are created by and maintained by community of over 1,500 open source contributors. This community has come to be known as DuckDuckHack. As of July 2019 there were 1236 Instant Answers active.In the DuckDuckHack documentation four types of Instant Answers are described Goodies Spices Fatheads and Longtails. These types of Instant Answer extensions are differentiated by how their data is retrieved. Goodies do not retrieve data from third party API whereas Spices do. Goodies instead use some form of the aforementioned static data sources such as text files or JSON files. Fathead Instant Answers are key-value answers hosted on DuckDuckGo 's backend. Fathead key-value pairs function similarly to trigger for showing the respective Instant Answer. Longtail Instant Answers are full text queries to DuckDuckGo database of articles. Paragraphs or snippets from any matching articles are returned and the section that matches the user 's query is highlighted. Tor access In August 2010 DuckDuckGo introduced anonymous searching including an exit enclave for its search engine traffic using Tor network and enabling access through Tor hidden service onion service. 3g2upl4pq6kufc4m.onion Accessing link help deprecated was the DuckDuckGo v2 onion service on Tor. This allows anonymity by routing traffic through series of encrypted relays. Weinberg stated believe this fits right in line with our privacy policy. Using Tor and DDG you can now be end to end anonymous with your searching. And if you use our encrypted homepage you can be end to end encrypted as well. In July 2021 DuckDuckGo introduced new v3 onion service with new link duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion Accessing link help. Bangs DuckDuckGo includes Bang keywords which give users the ability to search on specific third-party websites using the site 's own search engine if applicable. As of August 2020 13,564 bangs for diverse range of internet sites are available. In December 2018 around 2,000 bangs were deleted. Some of them were deleted due to being broken while others such as searches of pirated content sites were deleted for liability reasons. Business model DuckDuckGo earns revenue by serving ads from the Yahoo-Bing search alliance network and through affiliate relationships with Amazon and eBay. As privacy-focused search engine the ads served on DuckDuckGo are based on keywords and terms of the search query.The company supports charitable organizations that work to improve privacy In 2021 they donated US 1M to these causes and had donated 3,650,000 over the previous decade. Major donations for 2021 included 200,000 to the Center for Information Technology Policy 150,000 to the Electronic Frontier Foundation 75,000 to European Digital Rights EDRi and 75,000 to The Markup. Source code Some of DuckDuckGo 's source code is free software hosted at GitHub under the Apache 2.0 License but the core is proprietary. DuckDuckGo also hosts DuckDuckHack sister site for organizing open source contributions and community projects. The search engine 's Instant Answers are open source and are maintained on GitHub where anyone can view the source code. As of August 31 2017 DuckDuckHack was placed on maintenance mode as such only pull requests for bug fixes will be approved. Reception In June 2011 article Harry McCracken of Time commended DuckDuckGo comparing it to his favorite hamburger restaurant In-N-Out Burger It feels lot like early Google with stripped-down home page. Just as In-N-Out does n't have lattes or Asian salads or sundaes or scrambled eggs DDG does n't try to do news or blogs or books or images. There 's no auto-completion or instant results. It just offers core Web search—mostly the ten blue links approach that 's still really useful no matter what its critics say ... As for the quality 'm not saying that Weinberg has figured out way to return more relevant results than Google 's mighty search team. But DuckDuckGo ... is really good at bringing back useful sites. It all feels meaty and straightforward and filler-free .... The bare-bones approach cited in his quote has since changed for instance DuckDuckGo now has auto-completion instant results and news tab. McCracken included the site in Time 's list of 50 Best Websites of 2011. Thom Holwerda who reviewed the search engine for OSNews praised its privacy features and shortcuts to site-specific searches as well as criticizing Google for track ing pretty much everything you do particularly because of the risk of such information being subject to U.S. government subpoena. In 2012 in response to accusations that it was monopoly Google identified DuckDuckGo as competitor. Weinberg was reportedly pleased and entertained by that acknowledgment.In November 2019 Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey revealed his preference for using the DuckDuckGo search engine rather than Google stating love DuckDuckGo. My default search engine for while now. The app is even better. Conservative political commentators Ben Shapiro and Dan Bongino have also endorsed DuckDuckGo. Traffic In June 2013 DuckDuckGo indicated that it had seen significant traffic increase according to the company 's Twitter account on Monday June 17 2013 it had three million daily direct searches. On average during May 2013 it had 1.8 million daily direct searches. Some relate this claim to the exposure of PRISM and to the fact that other programs operated by the National Security Agency NSA were leaked by Edward Snowden. Danny Sullivan wrote on Search Engine Land that despite the search engine 's growth it 's not grown anywhere near the amount to reflect any substantial or even mildly notable switching by the searching public for reasons due to privacy and he concluded No One Cares About Private Search. In response Caleb Garling of the San Francisco Chronicle argued think this thesis suffers from few key failures in logic because traffic increase had occurred and because there was lack of widespread awareness of the existence of DuckDuckGo.Later in September 2013 the search engine hit million searches per day and in June 2015 it hit 10 million searches per day. In November 2017 DuckDuckGo hit 20 million searches per day. In January 2019 DuckDuckGo set record of billion monthly searches and in November of the same year it hit 50 million searches per day. As of March 2022 DuckDuckGo was receiving 102,704,358 queries per day on average. On January 11 2021 record of over 102.2 million daily searches was achieved. new record of 111,703,299 daily searches was set on 17 January 2022. During the year of 2022 DuckDuckGo experienced stagnation and slight downfall when it comes to the number of searches per month. At the end of the year 2022 they removed their traffic stats page. Internal surveys by DuckDuckGo found that users of DuckDuckGo had wide variety of political leanings.

The organization believes that criticism of terrorism on moral grounds is important but not enough. Criticism on political grounds is also important and the initiative understands such criticism to be based on certain values such as human rights which are common to all democrats regardless of their party affiliations or their political leanings. Main ideals The European Parliament describes the main ideals of ¡Basta Ya. as the following Clear and peaceful opposition to terrorism of any kind. To provide support for all victims of terrorism and violence and to ensure that the perpetrators of these criminal acts are made responsible for their actions. The right to hold views different from those of extreme and exclusive nationalists without aggression marginalization or discrimination of any kind. That the democratic institutions in the Basque Country must fulfill their obligations and respect the rule of law.The ¡Basta Ya. initiative is also critical of official nationalism. The group does not restrict itself to denouncing the erosion of the basic rights of many citizens but also promotes various actions in defense of these rights. Sakharov Prize In 2000 the ¡Basta Ya. movement won the Sakharov Prize prize awarded to defence of human rights and freedoms. The group was nominated for the Sakharov Prize in 2000 by Gerardo Galeote Quecedo José Ignacio Salafranca and others. According to the European Parliament they nominated for three distinct activities that the organization carried out in 2000. In February ¡Basta Ya. organized demonstration in San Sebastián under the slogan Por la libertad ETA kampora For freedom ETA out. This demonstration gathered more than 100,000 people. During this silent demonstration one of the platform members invited Spanish citizens to support his cause as they stood at the Boulevard under the slogan Let defend what join us together. The Initiative called for demonstration in San Sebastián under the slogan Por la vida la libertad. Defendamos lo que nos une Estatuto Constitución For life and freedom. Let us defend what unites us Statute and Constitution. In June 2000 the Citizen 's Initiative called for mass meeting on the first Thursday of every month in San Sebastián in solidarity with all those citizens threatened and attacked because of their defense of democratic values. Well-known members of the platform are Jon Juaristi Maite Pagazaurtundua Arcadi Espada Carmen Iglesias Javier Urquizu and Fernando Savater. Structure ¡Basta Ya. does not want to displace political parties or compete against other civic and pacifist groups who share their aims. They all command respect and they have other fields of activity or other areas of representation than the initiative itself. To preserve as far as possible the open and pluralistic character of this initiative it has decided to forgo professional and hierarchical organization. ¡Basta Ya. does not have board of management instead it appoints by common consent whenever necessary someone to act as the authorized spokesperson in public. Financing All the activities of ¡Basta Ya. have been financed by the contributions of private citizens and by the Miguel Angel Blanco Foundation 's subvention for the September demonstration for the defense of the Constitution and the Statute. Some other civic groups such as The Gregorio Ordoñez Foundation White Hands and Denon Artean have also helped the initiative in different ways. It now also has at its disposal the 50,000 Euros of the Sakharov Prize. End ¡Basta Ya. declared that it wishes to be able to dissolve itself as soon as possible because it has become unnecessary. That is because citizens of Spain are no longer running the risk of being assassinated or attacked because of their ideas or identities and because the Rule of Law worked in reasonable way the organization can discontinue itself. ¡Basta Ya. is determined to carry on functioning and calling on all citizens to mobilize whenever it seems necessary.In 2007 the organization was dissolved.

The film was entered into the 1953 Cannes Film Festival. It was the first full-length film Berlanga directed alone. Plot small Castilian town Villar del Río is alerted to an upcoming visit of American diplomats the town begins preparations to impress the American visitors in the hopes of benefiting under the Marshall Plan. Hoping to demonstrate the side of Spanish culture with which the visiting American officials will be most accustomed the citizens don unfamiliar Andalusian costumes hire renowned flamenco performer and re-decorate their town in Andalusian style. flamenco impresario Manolo Morán who spent time in Boston advises the locals to think of what they will ask from the Americans. On the eve of the Americans visit three of the central characters dream of stereotypical American culture and history based uniquely on their lives and experiences. The mayor dreams of Western-like bar brawl the hidalgo dreams of the arrival of conquistador on New World shores and the priest sees the hoods of Holy Week procession turn into Klansmen dragging him before the Committee on Un-American Activities accompanied by jazz music. Also poorer man dreams that the Americans shown as the Three Kings fly over his field and parachute new tractor into his field. The day of the Americans visit arrives and the whole town is prepared to put on show. However the American motorcade speeds through the village without stopping. The locals are left to remove the decorations and pay for the expenses with their personal belongings including the flamenco impresario who gives up gold ring given to him by the Americans in Boston. Production Initially Berlanga was commissioned to make film to serve as vehicle for the budding flamenco singer Lolita Sevilla but Berlanga decided to give the film deeper more satirical meaning. In creating Welcome Mr. Marshall Berlanga publicly claimed to offer human picture of what the Spanish peasant interested more in crops than in politics might feel about the American people and their role in the post-war world. Underneath the surface the film is an anti-Francoist satire despite receiving approval because the censorship board understood it to be an anti-American satire.Berlanga chose to film in the small village of Guadalix de la Sierra fifty miles north of Madrid. Villagers were cast as themselves taking all but the principal roles and changing many of the scenes. During the scene in which townspeople lined up to state their hearts desires they ignored the script and asked for what they actually wanted.Shooting lasted ten weeks with production budget of 70,000 780,000 in 2022 dollars. Influence The title is often mentioned in discussions of American investment in Spain as caveat against delusion. An example is the 2012-2013 Eurovegas project.The film is one of the influences on the 2019 Spanish comedy film The Little Switzerland. Cast Fernando Rey as Narrator voice José Isbert as Don Pablo the mayor hearing-impaired old man Lolita Sevilla as Carmen Vargas flamenco artist from Andalusia Alberto Romea as Don Luis the hidalgo Manolo Morán as Manolo the scheming agent for Carmen Vargas Luis Pérez de León as Don Cosme the priest concerned about the American heretics Elvira Quintillá as Miss Eloísa the teacher Félix Fernández as Don Emiliano the doctor Nicolás D. Perchicot as the pharmacist as Nicolás Perchicot Joaquín Roa as the town crier Fernando Aguirre as the secretary José Franco as the general delegate Rafael Alonso as the enviado José María Rodríguez as José Elisa Méndez as Doña Raquel Matilde López Roldán as Doña Matilde Reception Welcome Mr. Marshall. received positive reviews by critics and was immensely popular among Spanish audiences garnering enough praise to gain entry to the Cannes Film Festival. According to Peter Besas Madrid correspondent for Variety the film was denied an award at Cannes when judge the actor Edward G. Robinson under threat from Senator Joseph McCarthy vetoed it as anti-American. Despite this Welcome Mr. Marshall. received Special Mention.In April 1953 Jane Cianfarra of the New York Times anticipated that the film would do big things for what she referred to as Spain 's slumbering film industry as well as for the future careers of Berlanga and Bardem. In 1993 film critic Stephen Holden observed that although more than 40 years old this funny compassionate little fable has an ebullience and freshness that transcend its historical context.

Document type declaration,document type declaration or DOCTYPE is an instruction that associates particular XML or SGML document for example webpage with document type definition DTD for example the formal definition of particular version of HTML 2.0 4.0. In the serialized form of the document it manifests as short string of markup that conforms to particular syntax. The HTML layout engines in modern web browsers perform DOCTYPE sniffing or switching wherein the DOCTYPE in document served as text/html determines layout mode such as quirks mode or standards mode. The text/html serialization of HTML5 which is not SGML-based uses the DOCTYPE only for mode selection. Since web browsers are implemented with special-purpose HTML parsers rather than general-purpose DTD-based parsers they do not use DTDs and never access them even if URL is provided. The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as mostly useless but required header only to trigger standards mode in common browsers.,document type declaration or DOCTYPE is an instruction that associates particular XML or SGML document for example webpage with document type definition DTD for example the formal definition of particular version of HTML 2.0 4.0.

The DOCTYPE is retained in HTML5 as mostly useless but required header only to trigger standards mode in common browsers. DTDs Syntax The general syntax for document type declaration is or In XML the root element that represents the document is the first element in the document. For example in XHTML the root element is html being the first element opened after the doctype declaration and last closed. The keywords SYSTEM and PUBLIC suggest what kind of Document Type Definition DTD it is one that is on private system or one that is open to the public. If the PUBLIC keyword is chosen it is followed by restricted form of public identifier called Formal Public Identifier FPI enclosed in double quote marks. The public identifier may be followed by system identifier that is likewise double-quoted. For example the FPI for XHTML 1.1 is -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN and there are possible system identifiers available for XHTML 1.1 depending on the needs. One of them is the URI reference http //www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd. If instead the SYSTEM keyword is chosen only system identifier is provided. It means that the XML parser must locate the DTD in system specific fashion in this case by means of URI reference of the DTD enclosed in double quote marks. The last part surrounded by literal square brackets is called an internal subset which can be used to add/edit entities or add/edit PUBLIC keyword behaviors. The internal subset is always optional and sometimes even forbidden within simple SGML profiles notably those for basic HTML parsers that do n't implement full SGML parser. In XHTML documents the doctype declaration must always explicitly specify system identifier. In SGML-based documents like HTML on the other hand the appropriate system identifier may automatically be inferred from the given public identifier. This association might e.g. be performed by means of catalog file resolving the FPI to system identifier. Example The first line of World Wide Web page may read as follows This document type declaration for XHTML includes by reference DTD whose public identifier is -//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN and whose system identifier is http //www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd. An entity resolver may use either identifier for locating the referenced external entity. No internal subset has been indicated in this example or the next ones. The root element is declared to be html and therefore it is the first tag to be opened after the end of the doctype declaration in this example and the next ones too. The HTML tag is not part of the doctype declaration but has been included in the examples for orientation purposes. Common DTDs Some common DTDs have been put into lists. W3C has produced list of DTDs commonly used in the web which contains the bare HTML5 DTD older XHTML/HTML DTDs DTDs of common embedded XML-based formats like MathML and SVG as well as compound documents that combine those formats. Both W3C HTML5 and its corresponding WHATWG version recommend browsers to only accept XHTML DTDs of certain FPIs and to prefer using internal logic over fetching external DTD files. It further specifies an internal DTD for XHTML which is merely list of HTML entity names. §13.2 HTML 4.01 DTDs Strict DTD does not allow presentational markup with the argument that Cascading Style Sheets should be used for that instead. This is how the Strict DTD looks Transitional DTD allows some older PUBLIC and attributes that have been deprecated If frames are used the Frameset DTD must be used instead like this XHTML 1.0 DTDs XHTML 's DTDs are also Strict Transitional and Frameset. XHTML Strict DTD. No deprecated tags are supported and the code must be written correctly according to XML Specification. XHTML Transitional DTD is like the XHTML Strict DTD but deprecated tags are allowed. XHTML Frameset DTD is the only XHTML DTD that supports Frameset. The DTD is below. XHTML 1.1 DTD XHTML 1.1 is the most current finalized revision of XHTML introducing support for XHTML Modularization. XHTML 1.1 has the stringency of XHTML 1.0 Strict. XHTML Basic DTDs XHTML Basic 1.0 XHTML Basic 1.1 HTML5 DTD-less DOCTYPE HTML5 uses DOCTYPE declaration which is very short due to its lack of references to DTD in the form of URL or FPI. All it contains is the tag name of the root element of the document HTML. In the words of the specification draft itself In other words DOCTYPE html case-insensitively. With the exception of the lack of URI or the FPI string the FPI string is treated case sensitively by validators this format case-insensitive match of the string DOCTYPE HTML is the same as found in the syntax of the SGML based HTML 4.01 DOCTYPE. Both in HTML4 and in HTML5 the formal syntax is defined in upper case letters even if both lower case and mixes of lower case upper case are also treated as valid. In XHTML5 the DOCTYPE must be case-sensitive match of the string DOCTYPE html. This is because in XHTML syntax all HTML element names are required to be in lower case including the root element referenced inside the HTML5 DOCTYPE. The DOCTYPE is optional in XHTML5 and may simply be omitted. However if the markup is to be processed as both XML and HTML DOCTYPE should be used.

Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight),Gim me. Gim me. Gim me. Man After Midnight is song by Swedish band ABBA. It was recorded in August 1979 in order to help promote their North American and European tour of that year and was released on ABBA 's Greatest Hits Vol. album as the brand new track.,Gim me. Gim me. Gim me. Man After Midnight is song by Swedish band ABBA. It was recorded in August 1979 in order to help promote their North American and European tour of that year and was released on ABBA 's Greatest Hits Vol. album as the brand new track. Original ABBA version History Gim me. Gim me. Gim me. Man After Midnight was written and composed by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus with the lead vocal sung by Agnetha Fältskog. Fältskog as the narrator weaves the image of lonely woman who longs for romantic relationship and views her loneliness as forbidding darkness of night even drawing parallels to how the happy endings of movie stars are so different from her own existence. The melody line of the song was played on an ARP Odyssey synthesizer.Originally ABBA had recorded another song Rubber Ball Man which was planned as single. It featured the typical ABBA-arrangement with both Fältskog and Anni-Frid Lyngstad on lead vocals and the use of classical strings. This song was also performed by the group during rehearsals for its 1979 tour as Under My Sun. However the group felt that Gim me. Gim me. Gim me. with its disco sound would be better choice and thus Rubber Ball Man remained nothing more than demo. Single version The single version of this song which was released in its full length of 4:48 everywhere else in the world was released in the United States and Canada in an edited format being just 3:36 in length. This was done by removing the first half of the opening instrumental the first four of the eight bars of the instrumental bridge between the second and final chorus and fading the song out early. It is believed the edit was done by Atlantic ABBA 's North American record label and not Polar hence the reason why it was available only in the US and Canada. This single version has never appeared on any commercial CD issued by Polar/Universal to date and along with the US promo edit of Chiquitita it marked the only time Atlantic ever commercially released an edited version of an ABBA single while they had the North American rights to release ABBA recordings. As of September 2021 it is ABBA 's tenth-biggest song in the UK including both pure sales and digital streams.The single was never released by Polar Music in the group 's native Sweden instead being featured on the Greatest Hits Vol. album which did get Swedish release. While Polar released the single in neighbouring Norway Denmark and Finland copies of these versions were not made available in the Swedish record stores who thus arranged to import copies of the United Kingdom version on Epic Records. Sales of these imports were sufficient for the single to reach no. 16 on the sales chart in Sweden. Spanish version ¡Dame. ¡Dame. ¡Dame. is the Spanish-language version of the song. The song was released as single to promote Gracias Por La Música in Latin America and other Spanish-speaking countries. Reception Cash Box called it another exercise of sparkling euro-pop with the slightest hint of boogie bottom to give the song an edge.

Man After Midnight was another highly successful song for ABBA.

Critical reception Writing for Rolling Stone Brittany Spanos felt that working with producer Mark Taylor who helped seal Cher 's legacy with the game-changing 'Believe in the late Nineties she finds subtle changes that update ABBA classics without totally stripping them of the catchiness that made those songs beloved hits well beyond their heyday. Gim me. Gim me. Gim me. Man After Midnight 'SOS and 'Mamma Mia are given just enough of knob turn that they 're transformed from upbeat FM radio pop into club bangers pulsating with every beat.

Cattle Decapitation have released seven albums the most recent being Death Atlas which was released on November 29 2019.,Cattle Decapitation is an American deathgrind band from San Diego California formed in 1996. The band 's current lineup includes vocalist Travis Ryan guitarists Josh Elmore and Belisario Dimuzio bassist Olivier Pinard and drummer David McGraw. Cattle Decapitation have released seven albums the most recent being Death Atlas which was released on November 29 2019. History Founded in 1996 the band started with an entirely vegan lineup. Only two current members are vegetarian namely Travis Ryan and Josh Elmore.The 2002 album To Serve Man saw controversy in Germany where distribution company SPV refused to handle the album due to its graphic cover. The cover of the 2004 album Humanure featuring cow excreting human remains was reportedly censored without permission from the label in some outlets. Record store owners did not display the album making it difficult for customers to find and buy it. Former member Gabe Serbian was member of the band The Locust. Metal author and journalist Garry Sharpe-Young once acknowledged the band as one of the few metal bands whose message hits as hard as their music. In August 2009 Cattle Decapitation parted ways with long-time bassist Troy Oftedal because of musical and personal differences. Cattle Decapitation 's album Monolith of Inhumanity was released in 2012. It received positive reviews upon release.Cattle Decapitation has toured with extreme metal acts including Suffocation Cryptopsy The Black Dahlia Murder Deicide Behemoth Hate Eternal Krisiun and Job for Cowboy. The band also participated in Metal Blade Record 's Scion A/V Showcase in late 2012. The band spent the majority of 2014 writing new record. The tracking for the album was announced to have been completed on February 14 2015. On May 20 2015 Cattle Decapitation announced the title of the new record was The Anthropocene Extinction. Alongside this announcement the band released the first song of the record titled Manufactured Extinct. It was released through Metal Blade Records on August 2015.On April 30 2018 two Native American teens were pulled out of Colorado State University tour by the police for being too quiet and wearing dark clothing. When the band found out that one of the brothers was wearing Cattle Decapitation T-shirts they offered the brothers free guest list spots for life. In August 2018 the band announced the addition of Cryptopsy bass player Olivier Pinard as well as the promotion of touring rhythm guitarist Belisario Dimuzio to being full time member thus making the group five piece for the first time. The recording of the seventh studio album Death Atlas began in May 2019 and was released November 2019.On January 10 2023 the band announced their eighth album Terrasite will be released on May 12. Lyrical themes Cattle Decapitation 's songs protest the mistreatment and consumption of animals the abuse of the environment and touch subjects such as misanthropy and genocide of the human race. Much of the band 's music is based on putting humans in the situations that animals are subjected to for example animal testing slaughter etc. The band 's lyrics are largely concerned with human impact on the environment the ethics of eating meat and animal rights. Ryan comments Josh and are what you would call vegetarian. We 've tried and tried to be as up front about that as possible but the entire media world thinks we are hardline vegan which in turn trickled down to fans and we 're just not. 've been vegan at points but try to be as correct as possible and point blank there 's times on tour where just do n't know if what 've been given to eat has eggs or dairy in it and the road is rather unfriendly to us. We are n't afforded the luxury of going to Whole Foods at am after show. At that point it 's fucking Taco Bell or something disgusting. You 're driving down the road burning fossil fuels and your vehicle is covered in the carcasses of insects and sometimes birds and other animals. So how far does one take it. This is why ca n't claim vegan. live my life with as much compassion as can for others the environment and the animals though. At home it 's much easier.

It debuted at number nine on the US Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 69,000 copies in the United States low for the band becoming their first album since signing to major record label to not sell 100,000 records in its first week. Theme and composition In an interview with Billie Joe Armstrong and Mike Dirnt it was stated that ¡Dos. was going to have more garage rock—a little dirtier like you 're in the middle of the party feel to it similar to their side band Foxboro Hot Tubs. In couple of interviews Armstrong even went as far as calling ¡Dos. the second Foxboro album. The track Fuck Time originally performed as Foxboro Hot Tubs song was recorded for the album as was the track Stray Heart .Unlike the other two albums in the trilogy this album features thirteen tracks instead of twelve. The final track Amy is dedicated to the late Amy Winehouse. The song Nightlife features guest vocals from Lady Cobra of the band Mystic Knights of the Cobra. The song is one of the slower and darker songs from the trilogy and has Lady Cobra rapping in her respective parts of the track. The album 's tenth track titled Lady Cobra is inspired by her. black-and-white cutout of her with sailor hat is seen on the back cover with her eye crossed out with pink. Release and promotion trailer for the album was released on June 21 2012 on the band 's YouTube channel it included preview of the song Fuck Time. preview of the song Lazy Bones was featured in special Green Day themed level pack of Angry Birds Friends. Green Day also released previews of the songs Stray Heart Makeout Party Wild One Fuck Time Lady Cobra and Nightlife during an interview on BBC Radio One. very short preview of the song See You Tonight was featured in one of their tour videos. On October 2012 Green Day officially announced the track list for the album on their website. The songs Stop When the Red Lights Flash Amy and Nightlife were featured on the episode Unspoken of CSI NY alongside Kill the DJ from ¡Uno. and The Forgotten from ¡Tré narrating the first dialogue-free 30 minutes of the episode. An official trailer was released on October 15 and featured previews of Stop When the Red Lights Flash Fuck Time and Stray Heart. Stop When the Red Lights Flash is featured in the 2012 Electronic Arts racing game Need For Speed Most Wanted and is included on the game 's soundtrack album. The album was officially released to listen by Green Day on the Rolling Stone website on November. Vinyl copies of ¡Dos. feature Drama Queen from ¡Tré. instead of Stray Heart due to the fact that they were pressed before the two tracks were swapped. clean version of the track Fuck Time was released under the name F-Woo Time. Artwork The band uploaded trailer for the album on their official channel on YouTube showing the band in the recording studio as well as performing the song Fuck Time with their garage rock side band Foxboro Hot Tubs. During the trailer the cover artwork for the album was revealed. It features black-and-white cutout of Mike Dirnt with his eyes crossed-out with pink 's on geometric orange background. The words Green Day are loudly splashed in blue across the top of the cover while the word ¡Dos. is sprawled graffiti-style in white in the lower left-hand corner much like the artwork for their previous album ¡Uno. Singles Stray Heart premiered on Idiot Club Green Day 's official fan club on October 2012 and premiered on Zane Lowe 's BBC Radio show on the same day. It was later confirmed to be released as single for the album on October 15 in the UK and October 23 in the US. On October 18 it was announced on Idiot Club that fans could go to downtown LA to appear in the music video for Stray Heart on October 19. The video was released on November. The song reached number 10 on the Japan Billboard Japan Hot 100 in October. It was the only single to be released from the album. Critical reception At Metacritic which assigns normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics ¡Dos. received an average score of 68 based on 24 reviews which indicates generally favorable reviews. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine complimented its high-octane style and called it terrific little party record. Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times commended Green Day for allowing in much wider range of sounds and styles and found the album way more impressive than the rudimentary math of Uno. calling it an excellent Green Day album one of its best catchy revealing work. Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone wrote that Green Day harness es the sound of immolating teenage-wasteland lust for an album with distinct sense of life coming off the rails. Scott Heisel of the Alternative Press felt that apart from Fuck Time and Nightlife the album is so focused and straightforward and commented that despite some rote lyrics Green Day function at their best with hook-filled songs that are typically three minutes or less. Despite noting few outright missteps AJ Ramirez of PopMatters found the album generally engaging and dubbed it the best Green Day studio album since American Idiot—given the uneven nature of the LPs in between that 's praise that demands qualifiers. Kerrang. complimented the album 's variety and observed musical joie de vivre throughout.By contrast Jason Heller of The A.V. Club perceived lack of joy in the band 's garage-rock angle writing that they feel like they 're writing paper on the genre rather than celebrating it in song. Phil Mongredien of The Observer called the album oddly leaden and largely witless and criticized the band for flailing ever further from the pop nous that has underscored their finest moments. Barry Nicolson of NME found ¡Dos. too cluttered with filler to measure up against the best of the band 's stuff. Slant Magazine 's Jonathan Keefe wrote similarly only handful of its tracks are truly essential additions to the Green Day catalogue. Mark Roche of State felt that it has as many disappointing tracks as it does impressive ones and observed from Green Day the attempt to forge modern expectations with old school sensibility even if it does n't always work. Sputnikmusic 's Joseph Viney felt that Armstrong 's lyrics are the biggest hindrance and called the songs musically limp. Jon Young of Spin felt that Armstrong might want to abandon his juvenile posturing ... even the most seductive rascals lose their boyish allure eventually. Kyle Anderson from Entertainment Weekly stated scratches the party-till-you-puke surface and there 's plenty of minor-key darkness lurking below as in the bleary-eyed Lazy Bones and the lounge- lizard groove propping up Nightlife Commercial performance The album debuted at number nine on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 69,000 copies in the United States. The album has sold over 175,000 copies in the US. The album also debuted at number 10 in the UK with first-week sales of 24,613 and total sales of 91,870 as of October 13 2016. ¡Dos. became the band 's first album since their 1994 release Dookie that did not sell 100,000 copies in its first week. Track listing Notes On the vinyl pressing Drama Queen from ¡Tré. appears in place of Stray Heart due to it being printed before the tracks were switched between albums. Due to this Stray Heart never saw true vinyl release with Drama Queen appearing both on ¡Dos. and ¡Tré.

Plot HERO is rock opera modernizing Jesus 's last two years of life as narrated in the Bible. The story takes place in New York City in Brooklyn. The world government in this near-future dystopic Earth is centered under the International Confederation of Nations I.C.O.N. Under the iron fist of I.C.O.N. nearly all religion in the world has been wiped out except for small occult and mystic sects. Only one synagogue in Brooklyn exists. Currently New York City is police-occupied warzone between ethnic gangs and small isolated revolutionary groups fighting I.C.O.N. Of all the ancient world religions only Judaism survives and flourishes at least as much as it can. In Bethlehem Pennsylvania child named Jesus but referred to as Hero is born and forced to flee with his family to the small Jewish section of Brooklyn. Jesus grows up and begins to preach and teach the principles of Christianity to the people of New York City teaching people to love their enemies and care for each other. I.C.O.N. realizes Hero is threat and the chief of police Devlin with the help of chief Rabbi Kai Caiaphas conspire to end Hero 's revolutionary teachings.The Opera is narrated by Agent Hunter former I.C.O.N. agent who met Hero and was soon thrown into prison for joining him against I.C.O.N. The opera also features Petrov Peter Maggie Mary Magdalene and Jude Judas Iscariot the latter who conspires with Kai and Devlin to betray Hero. The storyline progresses through several stories about Jesus miracles and sermons using references from the Bible 's four gospels continues through Jesus execution at the hands of I.C.O.N 's angry mob and eventually ending with his resurrection.

The ǂKá̦gára–ǃHãunu system is currently undergoing mutual occultation and eclipsing events in which one body casts shadow on or obstructs the view of the other as seen from Earth. Names The names ǂKá̦gára and ǃHãunu are from the mythology of the ǀXam people of South Africa. ǂKá̦gára also rendered ǂKaʻgara and his brother-in-law ǃHãunu fought an epic battle in the east using thunder and lightning producing mountainous clouds and rain. The conflict was fought over ǂKá̦gára 's returning his younger sister ǃHãunu 's wife to their parents. The names were approved and an official naming citation was published on 16 June 2021 by the International Astronomical Union 's Working Group on Small Body Nomenclature.In the ǀXam language ǂKá̦gára and ǃHãunu are thought to have been pronounced ǂ͡káˤɡáɾa listen and ᵑ̊ǃʰəunu listen respectively. The initial letters ǂK and and indeed the letter ǀX in 'ǀXam represent some of the many click consonants that characterize ǀXam and other San languages. The diacritic under the first vowel in ǂKá̦gára indicates that it is pharyngealized vowel another characteristic of San languages. When pronounced in English the click consonants in words from ǀXam and other San languages are usually ignored much as Xhosa is pronounced KOH-zə rather than ǁʰosa resulting in KAHʼ-gar-ə and HOW-noo. ASCII approximations of the names are =Ka'gara and Haunu. Orbit and occultations ǂKá̦gára is cold classical Kuiper belt object. It orbits the Sun at distance of 44 AU once every 290 years. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of degrees with respect to the ecliptic.If the two bodies are spheres with equal density then mutual occultation events between ǂKá̦gára and its satellite ǃHãunu should have begun in 2015 and should continue until 2035. When ǂKá̦gára passes in front of ǃHãunu events may last as long as hours but when ǃHãunu passes in front of ǂKá̦gára they are expected to last as long as days. These latter events are only expected to occur from 2022 to 2027. Formation Prograde orbits dominate tight binary systems such as 469705 ǂKá̦gára those with satellite semimajor axes less than about of their Hill radii.

Satellite size and mass 469705 ǂKá̦gára has one known satellite ǃHãunu. The magnitude difference between ǂKá̦gára and ǃHãunu is 0.59 mag. This corresponds to difference in diameter of 13 if the two bodies have the same albedo.The system mass is 2.18±0.12 ×1018 kg and given the albedo the bodies are equivalent to single sphere of diameter 174+27−32 km. This corresponds to density of 1.1+0.9−0.4 g/cm3.

It is based on the question What if Jesus was born in Bethlehem Pennsylvania. After the original tour in 2003 ended it was released on DVD CD and was written into trilogy of novels and series of comic books. Plot HERO is rock opera modernizing Jesus 's last two years of life as narrated in the Bible. The story takes place in New York City in Brooklyn. The world government in this near-future dystopic Earth is centered under the International Confederation of Nations I.C.O.N. Under the iron fist of I.C.O.N. nearly all religion in the world has been wiped out except for small occult and mystic sects. Only one synagogue in Brooklyn exists. Currently New York City is police-occupied warzone between ethnic gangs and small isolated revolutionary groups fighting I.C.O.N. Of all the ancient world religions only Judaism survives and flourishes at least as much as it can. In Bethlehem Pennsylvania child named Jesus but referred to as Hero is born and forced to flee with his family to the small Jewish section of Brooklyn. Jesus grows up and begins to preach and teach the principles of Christianity to the people of New York City teaching people to love their enemies and care for each other. I.C.O.N. realizes Hero is threat and the chief of police Devlin with the help of chief Rabbi Kai Caiaphas conspire to end Hero 's revolutionary teachings.The Opera is narrated by Agent Hunter former I.C.O.N. agent who met Hero and was soon thrown into prison for joining him against I.C.O.N. The opera also features Petrov Peter Maggie Mary Magdalene and Jude Judas Iscariot the latter who conspires with Kai and Devlin to betray Hero. The storyline progresses through several stories about Jesus miracles and sermons using references from the Bible 's four gospels continues through Jesus execution at the hands of I.C.O.N 's angry mob and eventually ending with his resurrection.

ǃKung languages,ǃKung ǃXun also known as Ju is dialect continuum language complex spoken in Namibia Botswana and Angola by the ǃKung people constituting two or three languages. Together with the ǂʼAmkoe language ǃKung forms the Kxʼa language family. ǃKung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless the anthropological term Khoisan has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.ǃKung is famous for its many clicks such as the in its name and has some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. It also has tone and nasalization. For description see Juǀʼhoan.

To pronounce ǃXuun pronounced ǃ͡χũː˦˥ in Western ǃKung/ǃXuun one makes click sound before the sound which is like Scottish or German ch followed by long nasal vowel with high rising tone. Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine Honken 2010 Heine Honken 2010 classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider single language Northern–Western ǃXunNorthern ǃXun N1 Maligo ǃxuun kúándò ǃxuun Kwando ǃXuun SE Angola N2 ǃʼOǃKung ǃʼo ǃuŋ Forest ǃXuun eastern Angola Western ǃXun W1 ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun Eenhana district Namibia W2 ǀʼAkhwe ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun Eenhana Namibia W3 Tsintsabis ǃxūún Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia Kavango ǃXuun ǃxūún known as dom ǃxūún River ǃXuun in Ekoka Western Rundu district Namibia Angola adjacent Central ǃXun C1 Gaub Tsumeb district Namibia C2 Neitsas Grootfontein district Namibia tentatively also the Tsintsabis Leeunes and Mangetti different from Mangetti Dune dialectsSoutheastern ǃXun E1 Juǀʼhoan ju-ǀʼhoan -si Tsumkwe district Namibia Bots adjacent E2 Dikundu ǃxun ju-ǀʼhoa si Dikundu Caprivi E3 ǂKxʼauǁʼein ju-ǀʼhoan -si ǃxun ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn Northern people Gobabis district Namibia Heine König 2015 p. 324 state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects understand one another to quite some extent but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

Khwe language,"Khwe also rendered Kxoe Khoe is dialect continuum of the Khoe family of Namibia Angola Botswana South Africa and parts of Zambia with some 8,000 speakers.","Khwe also rendered Kxoe Khoe is dialect continuum of the Khoe family of Namibia Angola Botswana South Africa and parts of Zambia with some 8,000 speakers. Classification Khwe is member of the Khoe language family. The 2000 meeting of the Working Group of Indigenous Minorities in South Africa WIMSA produced the Penduka Declaration on the Standardisation of Ju and Khoe Languages which recommends Khwe be classified as part of the Central Khoe-San family cluster language comprising Khwe ǁAni and Buga.Khwe is the preferred spelling as recommended by the Penduka Declaration but the language is also referred to as Kxoe Khoe-dam and Khwedam. Barakwena Barakwengo and Mbarakwena refer to speakers of the language and are considered pejorative.Other names and spellings of ǁAni include ǀAnda Gǀanda Handá Gani and Tanne with various combinations of -kwe/khwe/khoe and -dam. History The Khwe-speaking population has resided around the bush in areas of sub-Saharan Africa for several thousand years. Testimonies from living Khwe speakers note that their ancestors have come from the Tsodilo Hills in the Okavango Delta where they primarily used hunter-gatherer techniques for subsistence. These testimonies also indicate that living Khwe speakers feel as though they are land-less and feel as though the governments of Botswana and Namibia have taken their land and rights to it.Until the 1970s the Khwe speaking population lived in areas that were inaccessible to most Westerners in remote parts of Namibia Angola Zambia Botswana and South Africa. Since then livelihoods have shifted from primarily from hunter-gatherer to more Westernized practices. The first Bantu-speaking education that Khwe speakers received was in 1970 at settlement in Mùtcʼiku settlement proximate the Okavango River.Some argue that this put the language in state of decline as younger populations learned Bantu languages such as Tswana. Khwe is learned locally as second language in Namibia but the language is being lost in Botswana as speakers shift to Tswana. It is also argued that this has led to semantic broadening in meaning of words in the Khwe language. For example to write ǁgàràá was formerly used to describe an activity the community members perform during healing ceremonies. The semantic broadening of word meanings has also permeated other parts of Khwe-speaking culture such as food animals and other forms of naming that some argue have introduced nonconformity. Noting this the original meanings of these words is still understood and used during Khwe cultural practices.While Khwe-speakers were in minimal contact with the outsiders until 1970 there was limited interaction between the Khwe and missionaries in early and mid-twentieth centuries. The missionaries for the most part failed to convert the Khwe-speaking population. The introduction to missionaries however introduced Western culture and languages in addition to Bantu languages.Despite the influence of Bantu languages in Khwe speakers education historically Khwe and other Khoisan languages have had linguistic influences on Bantu languages. The Bantu language speakers of the Okavango and Zambezi regions migrated to the area during the Bantu Migration and came in contact with the native Khoe speakers in the area. Through this initial contact Bantu language category precursors of modern languages such as Xhosa and Zulu amongst others adapted the clicks of the Khoe languages and integrated them into their phonology in reduced manner through paralexification. Some scholars argue that the contact-induced changes in Bantu languages have contributed to the general language shift away from Khoe languages such as Khwe to Bantu languages because of the increased familiarity in phonology. Distribution The Khoe mainly occupy the Okavango Delta of Botswana. Specifically Khwe speakers primarily live in the western Caprivi area in Namibia however the entirety of the Khoe population occupies much larger geography. Khwe speakers in the western Caprivi are somewhat distant lexically from other similar Khoe languages such as Damara. According to dialect survey conducted by the University of Namibia 's Department of African Languages it was revealed that proto-Damara most likely migrated through the western Caprivi area before the Khwe settled the area as there is little lexical overlap.The Khwe speakers distribution in the greater Kavango-Zambezi region influenced clicks in Khoisan languages some argue. The Khwe and other Khoe language speaking peoples resided in greater Southern Africa prior to the great Bantu Migration which occurred about 5,000 years ago. In this migration the Bantu speaking population of West and Central Africa around the Nigeria-Cameroon borderlands migrated to Southern Africa and in this process encountered the native Khwe population. While the Khwe migrated into the Caprivi and greater Kavango-Zambezi region after the Damara they were certainly there 5,000 years ago when Bantu speakers migrated to the area and through their linguistic and cultural exchanges both languages were fundamentally altered. The morphology syntax and phonology sections on this page further discuss the changes occurred and how it has influenced contemporary Khwe. Today an estimated 3,700 Khwe speakers live in Namibia with the vast majority residing in the western region of the Zambezi Region. The largest known Khwe settlements are Mutc'iku located adjacent to the Okavango River and Gudigoa in Botswana.Noting this there have been major forced migrations from government pressures that have influenced the contemporary distribution of Khwe speakers. In 1990 4,000 Xhu- and Khwe-speaking people including former members of the 31 Battalion SWATF who fought under the South African Defence Force in the Namibian War were settled in tent town in Schmidtsdrift South Africa. In 2003 the majority of this community relocated to Platfontein outside Kimberley following the Schmidtsdrift Community Land Claim. Phonology Khwe has 70 phonemic consonants including 36 clicks as well as 25 vowel phonemes including diphthongs and nasalised vowels. Khwe 's tone system has been analysed as containing syllabic tones register and contour although more recent proposed analyses identify only lexical tones high mid and low with the mora as the basic unit of phonological structure. Tone sandhi processes are common in Khwe and related languages. Vowels /o/ is realized as when lengthened but is realized as if it is pronounced short. Three nasal vowels are recognized as /ã ũ/. nasal /õ/ also exists but only in diphthongs as /õã/. Nasal diphthongs include /ãĩ ũĩ ãũ õã/. /oɛ/ and /uɛ/ are free in variation with /oe/ and /ue/ but only dependent upon speakers. Consonants /ʃ/ is realized as only in Buma-Khwe but as in ǁXo-Khwe and Buga-Khwe and as in ǁXom-Khwe /l/ is only found in borrowings. Click consonants Khoe click inventories generally combine four anterior constrictions types with nine to eleven anterior constrictions. The exact size of the click inventory in Khwe is unclear. Köhler established an inventory of 36 click phonemes from combinations of four influxes /ǀ. . ǁ/ and nine effluxes as well as borrowed voiced alveolar click ⟨ǃ̬⟩. Khwe is the only language to have pre-nasalized voiced click. Tones There are three tones in Khwe high /V́/ mid /V̄/ low /V̀/. Long vowels and diphthongs have eight tones missing only mid–low as combination. Morphology Khwe is suffixing language and thus has rich inventory of head-marking suffixes on nouns and verbs. Verbs take tense-aspect-mood suffixes TAMs marking for causative applicative comitative locative passive reflexive and reciprocal. Nouns are marked with person-gender-number suffixes PGNs. Gender division in Khwe is based on sex and is expressed by PGNs with gender being marked even in first-person dual and plural. Negation in Khwe is indicated with the clause-final negative particle vé which can be used to indicate non-occurrence of an event non-equation between entities and the non-possession of an entity. The post-verbal particle tí can also be used although its application is limited to prohibitive functions such as negative imperatives and the negative hortative and jussive constructions in which vé can also be used. Syntax Generally Khoisan languages have an SV constituent order. Central Khoisan languages have dominant AOV constituent order including Khwe though OAV order is used more frequently in casual conversation and storytelling.Khwe lacks separate class of adjectives. Pronouns nouns and verbs especially state verbs can be used attributively. Khwe has modifier-head order in which manner adverbs precede the verb and adjectives and possessors attributes precede the noun. In Khwe subjects of intransitive verbs subjects and direct objects of transitive verbs and one of the objects of ditransitive verbs are commonly omitted when the participants are known to the speakers through inner- or extra-linguistic context.Khwe has two multiverbal constructions that may denote series of closely connected events serial verb constructions SVC and converb constructions. An SVC expresses complex event composed by two or more single events that happen at the same time and converb construction marks the immediate succession of two or more events. SVCs in Khwe consist of two or more verbs forming single intonation unit with only the last verb being marked for TAM. The preceding verbs obligatorily take the active voice suffix. Converb constructions may consist of two or more verbs only one of which takes the TAM marking. Vocabulary In opposition to the postulated linguistic universal regarding the primacy of the visual domain in the hierarchy of the verbs of perception Khwe 's most widely applied verb of perception is ǁám̀ 'taste smell touch. Khwe has three verbs of perception the other two being mṹũ 'see and kóḿ 'hear but ǁám̀ which is semantically rooted in oral perception is used to convey holistic modes of sensory perception.The Khwe term xǀóa functions both as verb 'to be little few some and as an alternative way of expressing the quantity 'three. This term is unique in its ambiguity among numeral terms used by African hunter-gatherer subsistence communities.Khwe has large number of loan words from Afrikaans. Orthography In 1957 Oswin Köhler founder of the Institut für Afrikanistik at the University of Cologne designed an orthography of Khwe in which he published three volumes of texts and grammatical sketches based on observations of language and culture made over 30 years of visits to Namibia. As Köhler 's orthography was designed for academic purposes his volumes were published in German and French and therefore inaccessible to the Khwe themselves. Köhler never made an attempt to teach literacy to members of the community. Attempts to teach the Khwe orthography to first language speakers were not made until 1996 by scholars of the institute who took up Köhler 's work. At the request and with the consultation of the Khwe the orthography was revised and simplified by Matthias Brenzinger and Mathias Schladt between 1996 and 1997.A collection of Khwe folktales was published in 1999 by Christa Kilian-Hatz and David Naude using the revised orthography along with interlinear and free translations. Kilian-Hatz also published dictionary of Khwe although this is written in the linguistic orthography which uses symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet in place of the Latin script use for the applied orthography. The revised orthography has not been granted official status in Namibia. The Khwe language is not taught as subject or used as language of instruction in formal education and few literacy materials exist.

History Stud K7 has produced electronic music artists especially for the DJ-Kicks compilations. It began in 1985 with the idea of releasing digital video clips. In 1991 the first of the 3LUX series three volumes was released followed by the X-Mix series from 1993 to 1998. In 1995 the DJ-Kicks series was released. At that time it was unconventional to play complete albums with DJ cuts on home stereos. Artists such as Kruder Dorfmeister Nightmares On Wax Thievery Corporation and Stereo MC 's Chromeo Booka Shade contributed to its release. The compilation series has since included mixes from Jackmaster Seth Troxler Marcel Dettmann Michael Mayer DJ Koze Nina Kraviz Daniel Avery and John Talabot.In 1996 K7 started launching artist albums. As of 2014 the K7 discography features albums from artists such as Kruder Dorfmeister Matthew Herbert Dani Siciliano Ursula Rucker Swayzak and Boozoo Bajou. In 2001 Rapster Records new subsidiary of K7 started focusing on urban soul and hip-hop music. Since then Rapster has released records by DJ Jazzy Jeff Pete Rock and Roy Ayers among others. Rapster also forged an alliance with UK-based soul aficionado Peter Adarkwah head of BBE Records. K7 founded another subsidiary Ever Records in 2006 for indie bands and singer-songwriters such as Cortney Tidwell Cyann Ben and Howie Beck. In 2008 Strut Records Gold Dust Media joined the K7 label group. Between 1999 and 2003 Strut released Nigerian Afrobeats Leftfield Discos Rare Groove and Grandmaster Flash 's latest album. Strut 's founder Quinton Scott is responsible for. In 2013 K7 started cooperation with Tricky for releases on his label including his 2013 album False Idols. In May 2017 K7 created subsidiary focused on Contemporary music producing artists such as Niklas Paschburg Hior Chronik Echo Collective Henrik Schwarz Luca Alberto Maike Zazie and Martyn Heyne. In October 2017 K7 acquired the catalogues of Patrice Rushen Miriam Makeba and The Beginning of the End from Warner Music Group as part of the major 's divestments after acquiring Parlophone as result of the sale and break-up of EMI.

The ǁKaras region contains the municipality of Keetmanshoop the towns Karasburg Lüderitz and Oranjemund and the self-governed villages Aroab Berseba Bethanie Koës and Tses. ǁKaras western border is the shores of the Atlantic Ocean. Its location in Namibia 's south means that it shares long border in the south and east with the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. Domestically it borders only the Hardap Region to the north. Politics As of 2020 ǁKaras had 56,352 registered voters. The name of this region was Karas Region without the alveolar lateral click of the Khoekhoegowab language since Namibian independence in 1990.

Constituencies The region is subdivided into seven electoral constituencies Berseba Karasburg East Keetmanshoop Rural Keetmanshoop Urban ǃNamiǂNûs formerly Lüderitz Constituency Oranjemund Karasburg West Election results As in all other regions SWAPO was by far the strongest political party since Namibian independence. In the 2004 presidential election the region supported SWAPO 's Hifikepunye Pohamba with 65 of the votes. No other candidate received more than 10 .In the 2015 regional elections SWAPO obtained 83 of the total votes 2010 64 and won all seven constituencies. In the 2020 regional election the Landless People 's Movement LPM an opposition party formed in 2016 narrowly became the strongest party.

Spurious languages,Spurious languages are languages that have been reported as existing in reputable works while other research has reported that the language in question did not exist. Some spurious languages have been proven to not exist. Others have very little evidence supporting their existence and have been dismissed in later scholarship. Others still are of uncertain existence due to limited research. Below is sampling of languages that have been claimed to exist in reputable sources but have subsequently been disproved or challenged. In some cases purported language is tracked down and turns out to be another known language. This is common when language varieties are named after places or ethnicities. Some alleged languages turn out to be hoaxes such as the Kukurá language of Brazil or the Taensa language of Louisiana. Others are honest errors that persist in the literature despite being corrected by the original authors an example of this is Hongote the name given in 1892 to two Colonial word lists one of Tlingit and one of Salishan language that were mistakenly listed as Patagonian. The error was corrected three times that year but nonetheless Hongote was still listed as Patagonian language century later in Greenberg 1987. 133 In the case of New Guinea one of the most linguistically diverse areas on Earth some spurious languages are simply the names of language surveys that the data was published under. Examples are Mapi Kia Upper Digul Upper Kaeme listed as Indo-Pacific languages in Ruhlen 1987 these are actually rivers that gave their names to language surveys in the Greater Awyu languages and Ok languages of New Guinea.,Spurious languages are languages that have been reported as existing in reputable works while other research has reported that the language in question did not exist.

Also included is partial list of languages with their SIL codes that appeared at one time in Ethnologue but were removed prior to 2006 arranged by the first edition in which they did not appear. The list includes codes that have been retired from ISO 639-3 or languages removed from Ethnologue because the language apparently does not exist and can not be identified with an existing language. The list does not include instances where the language turns out to be spelling variant of another language or the name of village where an already known language is spoken these are cases of duplicates which are resolved in ISO 639-3 by code merger. It does include languages for which there is no evidence or which can not be found. In some cases however the evidence for nonexistence is survey among the current population of the area which would not identify extinct languages such as Ware below. SIL codes are upper case ISO codes are lower case. Once retired ISO 639-3 codes are not reused.

ǃKung languages,ǃKung ǃXun also known as Ju is dialect continuum language complex spoken in Namibia Botswana and Angola by the ǃKung people constituting two or three languages. Together with the ǂʼAmkoe language ǃKung forms the Kxʼa language family. ǃKung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless the anthropological term Khoisan has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.ǃKung is famous for its many clicks such as the in its name and has some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. It also has tone and nasalization. For description see Juǀʼhoan. To pronounce ǃXuun pronounced ǃ͡χũː˦˥ in Western ǃKung/ǃXuun one makes click sound before the sound which is like Scottish or German ch followed by long nasal vowel with high rising tone.,"ǃKung ǃXun also known as Ju is dialect continuum language complex spoken in Namibia Botswana and Angola by the ǃKung people constituting two or three languages.

To pronounce ǃXuun pronounced ǃ͡χũː˦˥ in Western ǃKung/ǃXuun one makes click sound before the sound which is like Scottish or German ch followed by long nasal vowel with high rising tone. Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine Honken 2010 Heine Honken 2010 classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider single language Northern–Western ǃXunNorthern ǃXun N1 Maligo ǃxuun kúándò ǃxuun Kwando ǃXuun SE Angola N2 ǃʼOǃKung ǃʼo ǃuŋ Forest ǃXuun eastern Angola Western ǃXun W1 ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun Eenhana district Namibia W2 ǀʼAkhwe ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun Eenhana Namibia W3 Tsintsabis ǃxūún Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia Kavango ǃXuun ǃxūún known as dom ǃxūún River ǃXuun in Ekoka Western Rundu district Namibia Angola adjacent Central ǃXun C1 Gaub Tsumeb district Namibia C2 Neitsas Grootfontein district Namibia tentatively also the Tsintsabis Leeunes and Mangetti different from Mangetti Dune dialectsSoutheastern ǃXun E1 Juǀʼhoan ju-ǀʼhoan -si Tsumkwe district Namibia Bots adjacent E2 Dikundu ǃxun ju-ǀʼhoa si Dikundu Caprivi E3 ǂKxʼauǁʼein ju-ǀʼhoan -si ǃxun ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn Northern people Gobabis district Namibia Heine König 2015 p. 324 state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects understand one another to quite some extent but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

Khoemana,ǃOrakobab or Khoemana also known as Korana ǃOra or Griqua is moribund Khoe language of South Africa.,ǃOrakobab or Khoemana also known as Korana ǃOra or Griqua is moribund Khoe language of South Africa. Names Khoemana from khoe 'person mana 'language is more commonly known as either Korana also ǃOrakobab ǃOra Kora Koraqua or Griqua also Gri xri Xri Xiri Xirikwa. The name 'Korana reflects the endonym ǃOra IPA ǃoɾa or ǃGora IPA gǃoɾa referring to the ǃOra people. Sometimes ǃOra is also known as Cape Khoe or Cape Hottentot though the latter has become considered derogatory. The various names are often treated as different languages called South Khoekhoe when taken together but they do not correspond to any actual dialect distinctions and speakers may use Korana and Griqua interchangeably. Both names are also used more broadly for example for the Griqua people. There exist or existed several dialects of Khoemana but the details are unknown. Phonology Khoemana is closely related to Khoekhoe and the sound systems are broadly similar. The strongly aspirated Khoekhoe affricates are simply aspirated plosives tʰ kʰ in Khoemana. However Khoemana has an ejective velar affricate /kxʼʔ/ which is not found in Khoekhoe and corresponding series of clicks /ǀ͡xʼ ǁ͡xʼ ǃ͡xʼ ǂ͡xʼ/. Beach 1938 reported that the Khoekhoe of the time had velar lateral ejective affricate k͡ʟ̝̊ʼ common realisation or allophone of /kxʼ/ in languages with clicks and it might be expected that this is true for Khoemana as well. In addition about half of all lexical words in Khoemana began with click compared to quarter in Khoekhoe. In Korana oe and oa can be pronounced as we and wa. The phoneme can be realized as /c/ before or. An intervocalic and are sometimes realized as /β/. is stated to be alveolar-postalveolar when not followed by close front vowel or. The aspirated phoneme tʰ is realized as an affricate sound /ts/ when followed by close front vowel or. The aspirated sound kʰ can sometimes be realized as kx. Some Griqua speakers may pronounce kʰ as kʼ. The tsʼ sound only seldom occurs. and can occur syllabically as m̩ and n̩. The trilled can also be realized as flapped in some speech. Voicing can be very weak in Khoemana in casual speech so voiced plosives can be hard to distinguish from voiceless plosives.There are four tones in Khoemana Population Reports as to the number of Khoemana speakers are contradictory but it is clear that it is nearly extinct. It was thought to be extinct until the discovery of four elderly speakers around Bloemfontein and Kimberley. 2009 report by Don Killian of the University of Helsinki estimated that there were less than 30 speakers at the time. Matthias Brenzinger reported in 2012 that one possible speaker remained but that she refused to speak the language. The discrepancies could be because the language has multiple dialects and goes by several names with scholars not always referring to the same population. Khoemana is listed as critically endangered in UNESCO 's Language Atlas. The loss of this endangered language would have significant impact on the heritage and culture of Khoemana speakers. Attestation Robust Khoemana before more recent language attrition is principally recorded in an 1879 notebook by Lucy Lloyd which contains five short stories some additional work was done in Ponelis 1975. As of 2009 the EuroBABEL project is searching for remaining speakers. History The people and their language first began to attract scholarly attention in the 1660s coinciding with Dutch colonial efforts in the Cape of Good Hope and the resulting armed conflicts. At the time Khoemana was widely spoken throughout the coastal regions of South Africa. After years of attrition during the colonial era to the 1930s and under apartheid from 1948 to 1994 the language has all but vanished. Currently speakers of Khoemana are not only scarce but scattered due to forced migrations during the apartheid era. This has rendered the language particularly vulnerable.

ǃKora Wars,The ǃKora Wars was period of raiding by the ǃKora people and subsequent military action by the Boer authorities. The mid-nineteenth century experienced migration as result of the protracted frontier wars that forced the movement of certain indigenous groups further north of the Cape Colony. These included the Khoisan the Basters derogatory term for people of mixed European and Khoi heritage and the ǃKora people whom the colonial authorities considered more of bandit community. The ǃKora were known to loot communities living around the lower to middle Orange River. The raids increased in volume and intensity during the mid eighteen hundreds. This forced the authorities to launch series of expeditions aimed at countering the raids. The ǃKora were finally stopped in 1879 but their intimate knowledge of the Gariep Orange River rendered them the most significant threat to settler colonies outside of the Bantu nations at the time.,The ǃKora Wars was period of raiding by the ǃKora people and subsequent military action by the Boer authorities.

This forced the authorities to launch series of expeditions aimed at countering the raids. The ǃKora were finally stopped in 1879 but their intimate knowledge of the Gariep Orange River rendered them the most significant threat to settler colonies outside of the Bantu nations at the time. Origins Recent studies has come to consider the ǃKora people as more of loose group of communities. Initially they consisted of two groupings the Little Korana and the Great Korana. Movement and divisions would come to separate them into even smaller groups. Some of these differences were caused by quarrels over grazing rights livestock and water sources. The ǃIkora were nomadic people who were not bound to any one place for long stretches of time even then they were considered to be semi-pastoral communities. Many of them shunned life in the Cape Colony because it meant living life of servitude and hard labour. Instead they looked northwards for free life. Their ability to use guns and ride horses effectively were skills adopted under colonial life and these were skills that would prove beneficial to their cause. This made them highly adept at raiding livestock belonging to colonial settler communities. Life along the Gariep Many groups within the ǃKora community lived all along the expansive Orange River. They became highly knowledgeable of it and used its islands and riverbanks to their advantage. During this time the banks of the Orange were dense with foliage and reeds. On the river itself were numerous islands dotted about which revealed themselves when water levels were low. The combination of tall reeds and the islands provided an advantage for the ǃKora because they were able to ambush their targets much easier. The legend of Stuurman In the 1830s the sparse settler communities along the Orange River region were able to counter some of the raids from the ǃKora people however highly skilled and organised group of ǃKora marauders began to emerge. former slave known as Stuurman who belonged to family in Griqualand led this group. Little is recorded on his ancestry. With growing number of disgruntled ǃKora under his leadership he gained notoriety in 1832 when he and his followers stole livestock on cattle farms south of the Orange River. It is reported that they stole wagons 3000 sheep 70 horses and 200 head of cattle. Over the next two years they proceeded to loot the border towns of Clanwilliam Beaufort West and Graaf Reinet. These were areas leading out of the Cape Colony policing presence in these areas was scattered. Stuurman also launched attacks on the Tswana of Griqualand. Stuurman was however shot and killed by white cattle farmer. Outlaws The 1860s in Southern Africa brought about serious drought which had profound impact on the movement of the Bantu communities the trekboers who were beginning to concentrate on life in the interior and the Khoi and San communities that were being forced further north by the latter 's migration. The communities around the Orange River were beginning to grow in their numbers reality that some ǃKora leaders took full advantage of. The most notorious leaders of this time were Klaas Springbokke of the Springbokke group Klaas Lukas of the Cat Korana group with Cupido Pofadder occupying the more westerly region of the Orange River. These fractured groups put lot of roving Trekboers and Bastaard communities under pressure with their cattle being prime target. Some of ǃKora were also rumoured to have secured smuggling networks further in the interior that could supply them with arms. Jan Kivido and Piet Rooi formed partnership and were the most consistent raiders. Conflict The first recorded significant incident between the ǃKora people and the colonial government occurred in 1869 when Griqua and Scottish trader were robbed along the southern bank of the Orange River. Piet Rooi the leader of another nomadic ǃKora group was held responsible for the robbery and as punishment was lashed and committed to three months hard labour. He was subsequently released on account of insufficient evidence against him. The treatment he received did not sit well with many of the ǃIkora raiders and this spurred them into increased levels of livestock pillaging that belonged to the settlers throughout the region.A three hundred-man strong commando under Special Magistrate Maxmillian Jackson was deployed to try and deal with Rooi and Kivido 's activities and although Kivido was killed in the insurgence the attack was considered failure as the commando struggled to navigate the islands due to limited understanding of the river 's layout. As result the efforts to deter the ǃKora from any more raids were increased. The authorities bribed two leaders of the most powerful groups Lukas and Cupido Pofadder. They were given protection in exchange for information on the other marauding groups. Lukas orchestrated the recapture of Rooi and some of his cohorts and handed them over to the Special Magistrate and about 400 men were sentenced to Robben Island. Aftermath Those who were able to evade capture retreated into the Kalahari Desert. Some among the captured ǃKora were forced back into manual labour on white farms while others succumbed to smallpox. In effect the entire ǃKora community was destroyed and some of their prominent lead raiders spent decades behind bars. By the time they were released they were too old and frail to resume their activities and the ǃKora people were too scattered to mobilise once more.

ǃKung languages,ǃKung ǃXun also known as Ju is dialect continuum language complex spoken in Namibia Botswana and Angola by the ǃKung people constituting two or three languages.

To pronounce ǃXuun pronounced ǃ͡χũː˦˥ in Western ǃKung/ǃXuun one makes click sound before the sound which is like Scottish or German ch followed by long nasal vowel with high rising tone. Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested.

Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

Dialects Heine Honken 2010 place Ekoka in the Northern–Western branch of ǃXuun ǃKung where Ekoka is equivalent to the Western branch. They distinguish three varieties Western ǃXuun Kung-Ekoka Tsintsabis natively ǃxūún spoken in Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia ǀAkhwe natively ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun spoken in Eenhana Namibia no name natively ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun spoken in Eenhana district Namibia Sands et al. place it in its own branch which they call North-Central Ju North-Central Ju Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis ǀʼAkhwe Okongo Ovambo MpunguvleiTsintsabis might actually be Central ǃKung. Phonology Consonants Ekoka ǃKung has an indistinguishable sound system to Juǀʼhoansi. However the series of palatal clicks /ǂ/ etc have fricated lateral release see fricated palatal clicks. These are provisionally transcribed ⟨ǃ͡s⟩ or ⟨⨎⟩ etc. and behave similarly to palatal rather than alveolar clicks in terms of not following the back-vowel constraint. In addition to the twelve 'accompaniments of clicks in Juǀʼhoansi Ekoka has preglottalized nasal clicks such as /ʔᵑǃ/. These are not common cross-linguistically but are also found in Taa and ǂHoan. König Heine 2001 report the following inventory with the clicks as analyzed by Miller 2011. One of the click series called 'fortis in König Heine is only attested at two places of articulation it is not clear which this corresponds to in the table below. There are also prenasalized /mb nd ŋɡ/ in Bantu loans. /tʰ/ is shown as post-alveolar cf. the epiglottalized /tᵸ/ found in Juǀ'hoan though this could be an alignment error. Similarly /tʃʰ/ is shown as palatal along with /tʃᵡ dʃᵡʼ/ and in contrast to post-alveolar /tʃ/.More recently Heine König find that Ekoka ǃKung also has series of preglottalized nasal consonants including preglottalized nasal clicks /ˀm ˀn ˀᵑǀ ˀᵑǃ ˀᵑǂ ˀᵑǁ/ Vowels Ekoka has full set of modal and murmured breathy vowels as well as pharyngealized back vowels and reduced set of modal murmured and pharyngealized nasal vowels ih eh ah oh uh aq oq uq in an un ahn ohn aqn oqn uqn Grammar Linguistically ǃKung is generally termed isolating meaning that words meanings are changed by the addition of other separate words rather than by the addition of affixes or the changing of word structure. few suffixes exist for example distributive plurals are formed with the noun suffix -si or -mhi but in the main meaning is given only by series of words rather than by grouping of affixes. ǃKung distinguishes no formal plural and the suffixes -si and -mhi are optional in usage. The language 's word order is adverb–subject–verb–object and in this it is similar to English the snake bites the man is represented by ǂʼaama nǃei zhu ǂʼaama snake nǃei to bite zhu man. ǃKung-ekoka uses word and sentence tone contours and has very finely differentiated vocabulary for the animals plants and conditions native to the Kalahari Desert where the language is spoken. For example the plant genus Grewia is referred to by five different words representing five different species in this genus. References Sources Bernd Heine Christa König 2010.

Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine Honken 2010 Heine Honken 2010 classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider single language Northern–Western ǃXunNorthern ǃXun N1 Maligo ǃxuun kúándò ǃxuun Kwando ǃXuun SE Angola N2 ǃʼOǃKung ǃʼo ǃuŋ Forest ǃXuun eastern Angola Western ǃXun W1 ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun Eenhana district Namibia W2 ǀʼAkhwe ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun Eenhana Namibia W3 Tsintsabis ǃxūún Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia Kavango ǃXuun ǃxūún known as dom ǃxūún River ǃXuun in Ekoka Western Rundu district Namibia Angola adjacent Central ǃXun C1 Gaub Tsumeb district Namibia C2 Neitsas Grootfontein district Namibia tentatively also the Tsintsabis Leeunes and Mangetti different from Mangetti Dune dialectsSoutheastern ǃXun E1 Juǀʼhoan ju-ǀʼhoan -si Tsumkwe district Namibia Bots adjacent E2 Dikundu ǃxun ju-ǀʼhoa si Dikundu Caprivi E3 ǂKxʼauǁʼein ju-ǀʼhoan -si ǃxun ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn Northern people Gobabis district Namibia Heine König 2015 p. 324 state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects understand one another to quite some extent but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

ǃKung languages,ǃKung ǃXun also known as Ju is dialect continuum language complex spoken in Namibia Botswana and Angola by the ǃKung people constituting two or three languages. Together with the ǂʼAmkoe language ǃKung forms the Kxʼa language family. ǃKung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless the anthropological term Khoisan has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.ǃKung is famous for its many clicks such as the in its name and has some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. It also has tone and nasalization. For description see Juǀʼhoan.

Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested.

Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana.

This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it.

Tuu languages,The Tuu languages or Taa–ǃKwi Taa–ǃUi ǃUi–Taa Kwi languages are language family consisting of two language clusters spoken in Botswana and South Africa. The relationship between the two clusters is not doubted but is distant. The name Tuu comes from word common to both branches of the family for person.,"The Tuu languages or Taa–ǃKwi Taa–ǃUi ǃUi–Taa Kwi languages are language family consisting of two language clusters spoken in Botswana and South Africa. The relationship between the two clusters is not doubted but is distant. The name Tuu comes from word common to both branches of the family for person. History The ancestor of Tuu languages Proto-Tuu was presumably also spoken in or around the Kalahari desert as word for the gemsbok hai is reconstructable to Proto-Tuu.There is evidence of substantial borrowing of words between Tuu languages and other Khoisan languages including basic vocabulary. Khoekhoe in particular is thought to have Tuu Ui branch substrate.Examples of borrowings from Khoe into Tuu include 'chest ǃXóõ gǁúu from Khoe gǁuu and 'chin Nǁng gǃann from Khoe ǃann. root for 'louse shared by some Khoe and Tuu languages ǁxóni~kx'uni~kx'uri has been suggested as deriving from 'pre-Tuu/pre-Khoe substrate. Classification The Tuu languages are not demonstrably related to any other language family though they do share many similarities to the languages of the Kxʼa family. This is generally thought to be due to thousands of years of contact and mutual influence sprachbund but some scholars believe that the two families may eventually prove not to be orphans. The Tuu languages were once thought to form branch of the now-obsolete Khoisan language family and were thus called Southern Khoisan. Languages Taa ǃXóõ dialect cluster Lower Nossob two dialects ǀʼAuni and Kuǀhaasi ǃKwi ǃUi Nǁng dialect cluster moribund ǀXam dialect cluster including Nǀuusaa ǂUngkue ǁXegwi ǃGãǃne †The ǃKwi ǃUi branch of South Africa is moribund with only one language extant Nǁng and that with fewer than elderly speakers. ǃKwi languages were once widespread across South Africa the most famous ǀXam was the source of the modern national motto of that nation ǃke eː ǀxarra ǁke. The Taa branch of Botswana is more robust though it also has only one surviving language ǃXóõ with 2,500 speakers. Because many of the Tuu languages became extinct with little record there is considerable confusion as to which of their many names represented separate languages or even dialects. The list of Khoisan languages has some possibilities. There were presumably additional Tuu languages. Westphal studied Taa variety variously rendered ǀŋamani ǀnamani Ngǀamani ǀŋamasa. It is apparently now extinct. Bleek recorded another now-extinct variety which she labeled 'S5 in the town of Khakhea it is known in the literature as Kakia. Another in the Nossop area labeled 'S4a is known as Xaitia Khatia Katia Kattea. Vaalpens ǀKusi and ǀEikusi evidently refer to the same variety as Xatia. Westphal 1971 lists them both as Nǀamani dialects though Köhler lists only Khatia and classifies it as ǃKwi. The Tuu languages along with neighboring ǂʼAmkoe are known for being the only languages in the world to have bilabial clicks as distinctive speech sounds apart from the extinct ritual jargon Damin of northern Australia which was not mother tongue. Taa ǂʼAmkoe and neighboring Gǀui of the Khoe family form sprachbund language bond with some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. All languages in these three families also have tone. References Sources Güldemann Tom. 2006. The San languages of southern Namibia Linguistic appraisal with special reference to J. G.

Zarch,Zarch also known under its ported name of Virus is computer game developed by David Braben better known as the co-author of Elite in 1987 for the release of the Acorn Archimedes computer. Zarch started off as demo called Lander which was bundled with almost all releases of the Acorn Archimedes. In 1988 Zarch was ported under the new name Virus to the Atari ST Amiga coded by David Braben and IBM PC coded by Chris Sawyer. It was later ported to the ZX Spectrum by Steven Dunn. The game was groundbreaking for the time featuring three-dimensional mouse-controlled craft the lander flying over tile-rendered landscape that dazzled reviewers in primarily 2D-dominated game industry ACE Advanced Computer Entertainment magazine led with the headline SOLID 3D the future of games. when it reviewed Zarch with score of 979 the highest rating ACE had given at that time only bettered by the later Amiga port Virus at 981. Virus was one of the first solid 3D games and was also the first to have 3D lighting effects and shadowing although these are less sophisticated than those of Zarch.,Zarch also known under its ported name of Virus is computer game developed by David Braben better known as the co-author of Elite in 1987 for the release of the Acorn Archimedes computer.

Virus was one of the first solid 3D games and was also the first to have 3D lighting effects and shadowing although these are less sophisticated than those of Zarch. Plot The plot of the game is reminiscent of the arcade game Defender in that the player piloting lone craft with limited firepower must defend finite landscape against ever increasing waves of enemy craft. In Zarch the landscape is being invaded by aliens who are spreading virus across the landscape. The Seeder vessels are slow-moving predictable and easily destroyed but as the game progresses they are supported by increasing numbers of flying support craft which do not scatter said virus but instead attack the player. The Seeder vessels scatter red virus particles across the landscape. As they land they turn the green landscape to brown and red and cause the trees to mutate. Some flying enemies shoot the mutated trees to cause themselves to become much more aggressive and dangerous. To clear each attack wave the player must destroy all enemy vessels. At the conclusion of each attack wave the player is awarded bonus points for the amount of landscape which remains uninfected. After four attack waves have been successfully repelled the player is awarded new landscape however there is comparatively less land and more water making complete infection more likely. Gameplay Zarch is notoriously difficult game for beginners. Controls are extremely sensitive simply moving the mouse while taking off can cause the lander to explode on the launchpad. The lander has single thruster pointing directly downwards beneath it. Firing the thruster causes the lander to fly straight upwards. The lander has flight ceiling above which the thruster will not fire. To fly in any direction requires the lander to be tilted in that direction. The lander can only pitch and yaw it can not roll. Too much tilt can cause the lander to turn upside-down position which may be difficult to recover and can cause the player to crash the lander by accidentally thrusting downwards. The lander although agile is vulnerable and may be destroyed by single enemy shot. The lander expends fuel and must occasionally return to the launchpad to refuel with successful landings being difficult. The lander must be completely level to land. While refueling it is vulnerable to attack from the air. Every round fired costs one point and the lander is equipped with rapid-fire autocannon. This makes it possible to achieve negative final score if one does not actually hit anything. At such times the game wryly points out that slugs and dried up bits of lichen have been known to get better scores than that. No powerups are available in the game although the player has limited number of smart missiles and smart bombs and is awarded new one of each with each extra life. Some enemy craft are so agile as to be able to outmanoeuvre the missiles and the smart bombs have very limited range. Radar screen In the top left of the screen is displayed radar screen which provides map of the whole landscape with the position of the lander and enemy craft marked on it. Uninfected territory appears green infected territory appears red. The radar detection is provided by rotating scanning-towers which are evenly spaced across the landscape accidental destruction of these results in loss of detection in that area and black squares appear on the map. Notable enemies In some levels fishlike enemy can be seen patrolling randomly on the water. It does not directly threaten the player nor is its destruction required to complete the level. It additionally does not appear on the radar screen. When destroyed it emits puff of virus particles and bonus points are awarded. Some players insist the fish enemy can be found on every level with diligent searching. In advanced levels high-altitude fast-moving bomber craft appears dropping packets of virus particles in profusion. This craft is difficult to destroy since the angle needed for the lander to match its speed is such that the cannon can not easily be brought to bear. Meanwhile it delivers huge amounts of virus particles to the landscape. Development Braben had use of an Acorn A500 development machine for two weeks in January 1987. He had been working on 3D landscape algorithms on the BBC Micro and then wrote Lander using ARM code. Lander Lander was demo version of Zarch bundled with new Acorn Archimedes computers. It was completed in less than three months as an illustration of their capabilities. Although the graphical environment controls and handling of the lander were similar to the released version of the game neither enemies nor virus were present on the landscape. Points were awarded for destroying trees and buildings. While the lander was stationary on the launchpad moving the mouse which would normally tilt the attitude of the craft would cause it to immediately explode. This bug was fixed in Virus the craft would not explode while sitting on the launchpad but only if landing were attempted while the craft was not level. Game engine The player flies the lander over an undulating landscape of square tiles. The landscape routine uses fixed tile sizes meaning that the depth of view amount of terrain being rendered directly influences the frame rate. In development greater depth of view reduced the frame rate to only one or two per second. Bank switching is used with the display being in 256-color Mode 13. The higher resolution Mode 15 was not used because that leaves less available memory and the required VIDC bandwidth also slows down the processor.Depth sorting uses bin sorting because objects only need to be approximately in order. The buffering demands memory but does not have the same time overheads as bubble sorting or quicksort. Colour keying is implemented by varying levels of white according to depth.Trees buildings and enemies are drawn in filled light-sourced polygons. Shadows of the lander and enemies are projected vertically onto the ground which does not cater for landscape curvature but is fast. Consequently shadows are not shown on other scenery. The shadows allow the player to follow movements of enemy craft by their shadows even when they are not visible on the screen. In Virus there is no light-sourcing. The game also provides particle system effects to depict the thrust from the lander explosions the virus spreading over the landscape and assorted other phenomena such as splashes when shots strike water and puffs of dust when they strike land. At altitude when the ground can not be seen dust particles in the air give the impression of movement and speed. Four major routines are used in the game 's programming Animate object nasties player missiles General particle bullets debris parachutes spray Landscape and Scenery trees houses radar .The hillside landscape is generated from number of pseudorandom sequence sine waves. Legacy The game was voted the 5th best game of all time in 1991 issue of Amiga Power.The followup to Zarch was game using the same landscape engine called Conqueror. In this game the player controls tank and fights enemy tanks in realistic manner. It was coded by Jonathan Griffiths and released on the Archimedes PC Atari ST and Amiga. In 1998 ten years after Zarch was released sequel V2000 also known as Virus 2000 was released for the PC and PlayStation. It was developed by David Braben and his company Frontier Studios who attempted to make the controls similar to but more forgiving than those of the original game.A few clones based on Zarch have also been created including version for Linux also called Zarch remake for Windows written in Blitz BASIC called Z-Virus and version crossing Zarch with Pac-Man called ZarchMan. The Amiga game Zeewolf 1994 and its sequel have noticeably similar design and appearance to Zarch.

It is the first animated television series intended for children created with Adobe Flash program which became widely used as medium for animation in the years.On January 2005 the direct-to-video feature film ¡Mucha Lucha. The Return of El Maléfico was based on the series. Premise The show is set in Luchaville fictional town in Southern California centered on lucha libre where nearly everyone in that town wears costume they are never seen without their mask and has well-known wrestling move. The series mainly centers on three friends Rikochet Buena Girl and the Flea as they struggle through the Foremost World-Renowned International School of Lucha where they study. Episodes Characters Rikochet voiced by Carlos Alazraqui and Jason Marsden young wrestler who is the protagonist. He considers himself the bravest of the group but sometimes leaps before he finds. Buena Girl Kimberly Brooks smart young female wrestler who always plays by the rules. She can also be very arrogant and obnoxious at times. The Flea voiced by Candi Milo friend of Rikochet and Buena Girl who is always dirty and refers to himself in the third person. As well as having few disgusting habits he is also the most nervous but often proves to be useful ally. El Rey voiced by Michael Donovan An action figure which represents Rikochet 's conscience. He carries him in backpack but he can move and talk on his own as if he were alive. It is stated that this action figure is just part of large merchandising euphoria related to supreme undefeated Mexican wrestler with the same name an allusion to Santo. Alongside the series several other El Rey toys appear and often causes trouble with Rikochet. Production ¡Mucha Lucha. was the brainchild of Eddie Mort and Lili Chin for Kids WB. Mort began his animation career working for Disney Television Animation in Sydney before leaving to work at Nickelodeon in Australia where he animated several shorts for the network including the Adventures of Hot Chunks and Snout. Lili Chin worked as an assistant animator on The Silver Brumby and as clean-up artist for Skippy Adventures in Bushtown. Chin and Mort launched Fwak. Animation Sydney-based animation studio in 2000. Through Fwak Mort and Chin made the short Lucha School in 2001 which featured fourth character that never made it into the series Psiclone. Lucha School would then be pitched to Warner Bros. Animation and Bardel Entertainment in the early 2000s. Bardel Entertainment would later produce the animation for shows like Teen Titans Go. and Rick and Morty. The pitch was success and Kids WB gave the show the green light afterwards. It was often regarded as one of the first fully-made flash cartoons produced for television. However it is not the first flash animated television series in general as that honor went to the 2001 short-lived television series John Callahan 's Quads which was exclusive to Teletoon and the Special Broadcasting Service. The second flash television series was Max Ruby another Canadian animated series. However ¡Mucha Lucha. was still considered the first fully-made flash animated series for American television and was also the first truly successful flash television series. During production the entire series was produced in widescreen. However it was aired with an SD format. The widescreen version was never released to the public until it became available for streaming. Several show creators did end up working on the show before moving on to other projects including Ciro Nieli who would later create Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go. and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2012 as well as Julie McNally-Cahill and Timothy Cahill who later created My Gym Partner 's Monkey and Littlest Pet Shop 2012 as well as Sandra Equihua and Jorge R. Gutierrez who later created El Tigre The Adventures of Manny Rivera. By season the series marked Peter Hastings return to Warner Bros. During the first season ¡Mucha Lucha. would provide morals at the beginning of episodes through title cards. Rikochet Buena Girl and the Flea would give viewers statements on what true luchador would do. For example Rikochet gives true luchador statement in the first episode Back to School and the statement goes like this True Luchador knows the only thing to fear is fear itself. Oh and bullies. These statements were not shown in the following seasons. Music ==== Original music score ==== The theme song was performed by Chicos de Barrio with remixed version done by Mambotron for season. During its first two seasons the show also features music by Michael Tavera who previously made music for Cartoon Network 's Time Squad and would later make music for shows such as Lilo Stitch The Series Yin Yang Yo and The Secret Saturdays. By season under Gigante Tavera would not have any involvement as he was replaced with Mambotron for the music consisting of Nicolas Barry Tomas Jacobi Rene Garza Aldape and Chuy Flores. ==== Licensed music ==== The show also featured some licensed songs. All of which along with the show 's theme song. would be released as part of the show 's official soundtrack.

It also premiered on Cartoon Network internationally in 2003 and in U.S in 2004. In March 2007 the show began its first rerun on Miguzi and was later replaced with Ben 10 for the last slot before Miguzi was shut down in the same year. The final rerun of the show lasted from 2008 to 2009 and it was removed from the lineup in 2010. Home media In Region Warner Home Video has released one compilation on DVD and VHS that contained the first six segment-episodes from season one titled Heart of Lucha on August 23 2003. The direct-to-video movie The Return of El Maléfico was released on October 2004 exclusively at Walmart while other retailers released it on January 2005 during the third and final season.

In this toy line included Mix-a-Lot action figures these had removable body parts that could be placed on the bodies of other action figures in the series. Signature Move action figures were also put out along with toy wrestling ring. However the second series of the toy line was canceled. During the summer of 2003 DC Comics published three-issue mini-series of comic books based on ¡Mucha Lucha. All three of the stories featured in these comic books were written by Eddie Mort and have even been occasionally referenced in the TV series. El Rey Come Home. It 's All Buena. Limbo of the Lost Luchadores The show was licensed for Game Boy Advance video game Mascaritas of the Lost Code in late 2003 and also Sony PlayStation video game Mysterioso Grande was slated for release but was cancelled around 2004 as the creators could not find publisher.

Through Fwak Mort and Chin made the short Lucha School in 2001 which featured fourth character that never made it into the series Psiclone. Lucha School would then be pitched to Warner Bros. Animation and Bardel Entertainment in the early 2000s. Bardel Entertainment would later produce the animation for shows like Teen Titans Go. and Rick and Morty. The pitch was success and Kids WB gave the show the green light afterwards. It was often regarded as one of the first fully-made flash cartoons produced for television. However it is not the first flash animated television series in general as that honor went to the 2001 short-lived television series John Callahan 's Quads which was exclusive to Teletoon and the Special Broadcasting Service. The second flash television series was Max Ruby another Canadian animated series. However ¡Mucha Lucha. was still considered the first fully-made flash animated series for American television and was also the first truly successful flash television series. During production the entire series was produced in widescreen. However it was aired with an SD format. The widescreen version was never released to the public until it became available for streaming. Several show creators did end up working on the show before moving on to other projects including Ciro Nieli who would later create Super Robot Monkey Team Hyperforce Go. and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2012 as well as Julie McNally-Cahill and Timothy Cahill who later created My Gym Partner 's Monkey and Littlest Pet Shop 2012 as well as Sandra Equihua and Jorge R. Gutierrez who later created El Tigre The Adventures of Manny Rivera. By season the series marked Peter Hastings return to Warner Bros. During the first season ¡Mucha Lucha. would provide morals at the beginning of episodes through title cards. Rikochet Buena Girl and the Flea would give viewers statements on what true luchador would do. For example Rikochet gives true luchador statement in the first episode Back to School and the statement goes like this True Luchador knows the only thing to fear is fear itself. Oh and bullies. These statements were not shown in the following seasons. Music ==== Original music score ==== The theme song was performed by Chicos de Barrio with remixed version done by Mambotron for season. During its first two seasons the show also features music by Michael Tavera who previously made music for Cartoon Network 's Time Squad and would later make music for shows such as Lilo Stitch The Series Yin Yang Yo and The Secret Saturdays. By season under Gigante Tavera would not have any involvement as he was replaced with Mambotron for the music consisting of Nicolas Barry Tomas Jacobi Rene Garza Aldape and Chuy Flores. ==== Licensed music ==== The show also featured some licensed songs. All of which along with the show 's theme song. would be released as part of the show 's official soundtrack.

It was also used during the Spanish Civil War by the Republican faction. Origin The widespread use of the slogan originates from the 1916 Battle of Verdun in the First World War when French General Robert Nivelle urged his troops not to let the enemy pass. The simplified slogan of they shall not pass appeared on French war propaganda posters most notably by French artist Maurice Neumont in the last year of the war after the Allied victory at the Second Battle of the Marne.Later during the First World War the slogan was used by Romanian soldiers during the Battle of Mărășești with the Romanian translation of the phrase being Pe aici nu se trece translating as One does not pass through here. The slogan was adopted on uniform badges by French units manning the Maginot Line. Later use French socialist politician Léon Blum SFIO in 1934 used this sentence Ils ne passeront pas. against the Ligue 's demonstration of the February. Ils they designated the fascist protesters. It was also used during the Spanish Civil War this time at the siege of Madrid by Dolores Ibárruri Gómez member of the Communist Party of Spain in her famous No pasarán speech on 18 July 1936. The leader of the Nationalist forces Generalísimo Francisco Franco upon gaining Madrid responded to this slogan by declaring Hemos pasado We have passed. ¡No pasarán. was used by British anti-fascists during the October 1936 Battle of Cable Street and is still used in this context in some political circles. It was often accompanied by the words nosotros pasaremos we will pass to indicate that communists rather than fascists will be the ones to seize state power.The phrase was brought to the public consciousness again following action in December 1943 by French-Canadian officer Paul Triquet of the Royal 22e Regiment his action included his use of Nivelle 's phrase to win key objective at Ortona Italy in the face of overwhelming German opposition. In the 1980s the phrase ¡No pasarán. was theme in the civil wars in Central America particularly in Nicaragua.

Story Plot Keiichi Morisato is college sophomore who accidentally calls the Goddess Help Line. The goddess Belldandy materializes and tells him that her agency has received system request from him and has been sent to grant him single wish. Believing that practical joke is being played on him he wishes that she will stay with him forever and his wish is granted. Since he is unable to live with Belldandy in his male-only dorms they are forced to look for alternative housing eventually seeking shelter in an old Buddhist temple. They are allowed to stay there indefinitely after the young monk living there leaves on pilgrimage to India upon being impressed by Belldandy 's intrinsic goodness. Keiichi 's life with Belldandy becomes even more hectic when her elder sister Urd and her younger sister Skuld move in as well. series of adventures ensue as his relationship with Belldandy develops. Setting The Oh My Goddess. universe is fashioned loosely around Celtic/Norse Mythology various names and concepts are recycled for humor. Three worlds exist in the Universe of Oh My Goddess Heaven Valhalla Hell Niflheim and Earth. Heaven is the realm of the All Mighty and goddesses Hell is the realm of Hild and demons and Earth is the realm of humans. Reality is controlled by an enormous and complex computer system named Yggdrasil. Each goddess is assigned Class Category and Restrictions. Class indicates power and skill in performing pure magic. First Class goddesses are held to stricter standard regarding the prohibition to lie. There are also three categories Administration Commercial Field and Special Duty. Limited and Unlimited restrictions indicates boundaries on permitted actions. Goddesses may be penalized for dereliction of duty and may have their license suspended for time. goddess using her powers during suspension will have her license permanently revoked. Belldandy is Goddess First Class Second Category Unlimited License. Urd and Skuld are Goddesses Second Class First Category Limited License. Goddesses also wear power limiters usually in the form of jewelry. The goddesses purpose is to bring happiness to everyone around them. Toward that end Heaven has created the Goddess Technical Helpline also called Goddess Relief Agency designed to bring happiness to the people of Earth especially those with great virtue but terrible misfortune. competing institution named the Earth Assistance Center also is staffed by goddesses. In most scenarios goddess appears before one that the system has deemed worthy and grants him or her one wish. The wish must be approved by the system after which contract is created between the human and the goddess and stored on the Yggdrasil system as file. The wish contract file is protected by passcode known to the Goddess. As demons work toward the opposite end the total happiness on Earth must remain in balance. Heaven and Hell strictly abide by an agreement to work through contracts and to prevent bloodshed between them each god is linked to demon by life contract thus if one of them is killed the other perishes as well with their memories of the contract erased to ensure no one knows who is paired with whom. Demons have similar class and license restrictions and are accompanied by familiars instead of angels. seal exists between the demon world and Earth named the Gate to the Netherworld. It was created by the gods and can only be broken by an instrument of the gods. As such demons require catalyst to manifest on Earth. The demons possess system similar to Yggdrasil named Nidhogg. Both demons and goddesses possess the power to seal beings away. The demons also operate in fashion similar to goddesses by creating contracts with humans and offering them wishes but often at price.A goddess does not have an angel automatically but receives one in egg form. When her power matures the egg hatches into an angel becoming lifetime companion. The angel always obeys the goddess being reflection of the goddess inner self.Other creatures that exist in the Earth plane are multitude of spirits that are responsible for almost every aspect of life. These include the spirits of Money Wind Engine and such. More specific entities include Earth spirits which are guardians over specific area of land. Morgan le Fay villain from the movie is probably high ranking Earth spirit or being from another dimension but that is less likely because her tragic love story with human must have happened on Earth who demonstrates great strength fighting Belldandy and Urd even though her powers are less potent than the ones of goddesses of their level. Production Before starting work on Oh My Goddess Kōsuke Fujishima created the manga You 're Under Arrest. Miyuki Kobayakawa one of the principal characters of You 're Under Arrest was featured as goddess character in four-panel gag strip in the manga. While the exact relationship between this initial goddess character and the Oh My Goddess. series is unclear there are suggestions that Oh My Goddess. can be viewed as spin-off series. Irrespective of the origin the concept of goddess as job interested Fujishima leading to the first appearance of the Oh My Goddess. series in Kodansha 's Monthly Afternoon in September 1988. Title discrepancy Translating the original Japanese title of Aa. Megami-sama. ああっ女神さまっ proved to be problematic. Fred Patten in writing the preface to the collection Watching Anime Reading Manga 25 Years of Essays and Reviews stated that fans were still debating whether Ah. My Goddess or Oh My Goddess. should be used at the time of writing approximately 15 years after the first Oh My Goddess. manga was published. When the United States anime import company AnimEigo obtained the original video animation OVA rights they titled the series Oh My Goddess. This approach was also followed by Toren Smith and Dark Horse Comics when translating the manga released in concert with the OVA series in 1994. Smith has since stated that he saw the title as play on Oh my god. and felt that there was no problem when translating it. Smith confirmed that his interpretation of the author 's intent was correct by consulting with Fujishima. Nevertheless Kodansha 's bilingual release of the manga used Ah. My Goddess as did Pioneer 's North American release of the film and Media Blasters 's 2005 DVD release of the TV series.Fujishima stated in Animerica that Oh was closer to his intent but acknowledged that the title should be rendered so as to make sense within the country that it is published and specifically stated that films may warrant different titles than other works. He did however state that he would prefer to see consistency between the titles of the manga and those of the animations.

The anthem has been performed in various versions been the subject of attempted reforms and been widely performed in the arts. The lyrics of the anthem are composed of chorus and eleven stanzas though it is usually sung chorus–first verse–chorus. History Background In 1819 the contradanzas La vencedora and La libertadora were performed to celebrate the triumph of the patriots in the Battle of Boyacá. After the independence of Colombia in 1810 and the dissolution of Gran Colombia in 1831 numerous songs were written in honour of the liberator Simón Bolívar. One of the first antecedents of the national anthem was presented on 20 July 1836 when the Spanish Francisco Villalba who had arrived in Colombia with theatre company composed patriotic song for New Granada. The song became very popular and was considered the first patriotic anthem in the country. The verses of the chorus were as follows In 1847 English composer and painter Henry Price founder of the Philharmonic Society put music to some verses written by Santiago Pérez in an anthem called Canción nacional National Song which was not widely accepted due to its simplicity. Henry Price was the father of Jorge Wilson Price who after living in New York City returned to Bogotá in 1855 to dedicate himself to translating compositions and founding the National Academy of Music of Colombia in 1882 inviting the young Italian composer Oreste Síndici as an adviser and professor of the academy. In 1910 the National Academy of Music would become the National Conservatory of Colombia.In 1849 José Caicedo Rojas wrote poem and José Joaquín Guarín composed the melody of an anthem called Oda al 20 de julio Ode to 20 July which was set to music in the key of flat for four voices and orchestra. Its premiere was held at the Museum of Colonial Art but due to its complexity it did not convince the public either. In 1883 Dutch violinist Carlos Von Oecken set music to poem written by Lino de Pombo in 1852.Decree 256 of 12 April 1881 called for competition to select the national anthem. The jurors for this contest were politician José María Quijano poet Rafael Pombo and musician Carlos Schloss. In the reviews published in different newspapers it was stated that none of the anthems performed aroused enthusiasm in the spirit of the jury and that for this reason the competition was declared void.On July 1883 the government of the Sovereign State of Cundinamarca organised competition to select the anthem on the occasion of the centennial of the birth of the Liberator Bolívar on 24 July. The first prize was obtained by Daniel Figueroa who composed an anthem with lyrics from various poems that premiered at the Plaza de Bolívar with choir of 2,000 children. The second prize was obtained by Cayetano Fajardo. For its part the jury noted that none of the awarded anthems were classified as national anthems but rather patriotic songs. Composition In 1887 theatre director José Domingo Torres who was used to enlivening the national holidays sought out Síndici to ask him to write song on the occasion of the celebration of the independence of Cartagena which was the first Colombian city to declare independence from the Spanish on 11 November 1811. For the song Domingo Torres asked him to score poem called Himno Patriótico Patriotic Hymn written by President of the Republic Rafael Núñez in honour of Cartagena which was composed to be declared publicly during the celebration of 11 November 1850 and published in the newspaper La Democracia when Núñez was still secretary of government of the Province of Cartagena. After this first publication the poem was adapted improved and published by Núñez himself in the magazine Hebdomadaria number and July 1883. 86 previous musicalisation of the same poem by Núñez performed by maestros Delgado and Fortich at the request of José Domingo Torres himself which was performed at the Plaza de Bolívar on 20 July 1880 failed to gain acceptance among the audience present. The following is the original poem by Rafael Núñez from 1850 Initially Síndici refused to compose the song despite Torres 's insistence. He finally managed to convince himself through his wife Justina Jannaut. Prior to that Síndici had demanded that José Domingo Torres look for the author of the poem so that he would adjust the verses according to the necessary arrangement for melody and give them national connotation.For the composition of the anthem Síndici retired to his Hacienda El Prado The Meadow in Nilo Cundinamarca carrying Dolt Graziano Tubi harmonium. The original score in the key of E-flat major and four-beat measure tempo di marcia currently rests in room in the National Museum of Colombia. The pre-premiere of the melody would take place under tamarind tree in the main park of the Cundinamarca municipality on 24 July 1887 after Sunday mass.The national anthem was premiered on 11 November 1887 during the celebration of the independence of Cartagena with choir of children from three primary schools students of Síndici. This first interpretation of the anthem was performed at the Teatro de Variedades Theatre of Varieties of the public school of Santa Clara which was located in the current carrera octava Eighth Avenue on the site of the Church of Santa Clara adjacent to the Convent and to the Astronomical Observatory in the jurisdiction of the Bogotá Cathedral neighbourhood. Included within the programme of celebrations of that date was the laying of the first stone of the Municipal Theatre of Bogotá in this same place the theatre was inaugurated in 1890 and operated there until its demolition and transfer to the Jorge Eliécer Gaitán Theater in 1952.President Rafael Núñez learnt of the impact of the melody and invited Oreste Síndici to present it officially. To that end Minister of Government Felipe Fermín Paul was commissioned to organise presentation of the anthem on December of the same year at p.m. in the grade room of the Palacio de San Carlos currently located in the Museum of Colonial Art. The anthem was sung by choir of 25 voices in the presence of the main civil ecclesiastical and military authorities of the country. In the invitation to the event the song was already announced as the National Anthem. Distribution The song quickly became well known and several editions were published throughout the country in the following years. In 1890 the anthem was performed in Rome Mexico Lima Caracas and Curaçao. The first phonographic recording was made at the Columbia Phonograph Company studios in New York City in July 1910 performed by the musical group La Lira Antioqueña The Antioquian Lyre to celebrate the first centenary of the independence of Colombia. The national anthem appears referenced as such in various publications of the time prior to its official adoption. Thus an essay by Manuel María Fajardo from 1908 the patriotic primer by Camilo Villegas González from 1910 text of selected poems by Lisímaco Palau from 1912 and hymn book by Ernesto Murillo from 1917 already cite the song composed by Oreste Síndici as the national anthem of Colombia. The lyrics and sheet music of the anthem were also included in the centennial urn that was closed on 31 October 1911 and that was opened during the celebration of the Bicentennial of Colombia on 20 July 2010.For the adoption of the national anthem the representative to the Chamber for the department of Nariño Sergio Burbano presented the bill on August 1920. The plan was approved in the debate of the public instruction commission and later by the plenary session of the Congress of the Republic making it official by Law 33 of 18 October 1920 which was sanctioned by President Marco Fidel Suárez. In this law an expert opinion was also requested to recognise the artistic property rights of the heirs of Oreste Síndici.During the border conflict with Peru 1932–1934 the soldiers who defended national sovereignty sang refrain in the trumpet introduction when entering the battle front in accordance with the warlike moment that the nation was experiencing. This transitory stanza stood as the following This introduction was taught to students in primary schools in the 1930s according to historian José Antonio Amaya and it was still being taught in the 1960s. The final line is very similar to line in the national anthem of Cuba that goes ¡Que morir por la patria es vivir. As time went by different versions of the anthem appeared. In 1946 the Ministry of National Education with the aim of unifying the criteria appointed commission made up of experts. As result of this investigation the government issued executive decree number 1963 of July 1946 stating that the official scores and the transcriptions for symphony orchestra of the anthem made by Norte de Santander musician José Rozo Contreras in 1933 are the most faithful to the originals written by Oreste Síndici. Since then this version has been officially adopted. During the government of Belisario Betancur San Andrés residents were authorised to sing version of the anthem in English and indigenous peoples to sing the version in their own languages.Decree 3558 of November 1949 which approves the Garrison Service Regulations is the first protocol norm that establishes the occasions on which the anthem must be sung. Law 12 of 29 February 1984 ratified in its article the validity of the national anthem of Colombia.Law 198 of 17 July 1995 which legislates national symbols made it mandatory to broadcast them on all radio and television stations in the country at both 6:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. with the latter medium on varied schedule for those deprived of clear signal and not applicable to national cable TV channels as well as during public addresses by the President of the Republic and other official events. Lyrics The national anthem is made up of an Alexandrine chorus and eleven stanzas in heptasyllabic octavillas but throughout its execution only the chorus and the first verse are usually performed. The stanzas are recount of historical events and philosophical reflections on the independence of Colombia and other Latin American countries. Stanzas and III can be described as evocative stanzas II and XI heroic stanzas VI and VII epic stanzas IV and VIII elegiac and stanzas IX and synthetic. The music has tonality of flat major and 4/4 time tempo di marcia. Protocol The rules of protocol for singing and listening to the national anthem of Colombia are regulated in articles 10 and 11 of decree 1967 of 15 August 1991. The national anthem is authorised to be played at official functions that have patriotic character when raising and lowering the flag of Colombia when honouring the Blessed Sacrament and at educational events and sports competitions. It is also authorised to sing it with or without musical accompaniment by the general public. When listening to the national anthem those present must stop their activities and stand up and the men must uncover their heads. All people should release their arms and adopt posture of respect and veneration. Riders drivers and passengers of the vehicles must alight and proceed accordingly. The national anthem is never applauded. 325 By decree 91 of 21 January 1942 only Colombian patriotic anthems are allowed to be sung in the country 's educational institutions with the exception of special ceremonies in honour of friendly countries that are held on campus. In accordance with decree 1722 of 16 July 1942 all schools must begin their tasks on the first Monday of each month with brief but solemn act during which the flag is raised to the chords of the national anthem sung by the whole community. According to the Protocol Manual of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the presentation of the credentials of new ambassador the performance of the national anthem is assigned to the Band of Musicians of the Presidential Guard Battalion. Verses The anthem should be played chorus-verse-chorus. Although the first verse is usually sung between choruses any of the eleven verses may be used. The anthem should be played chorus-verse-chorus regardless of which verse is selected. This is how it is customarily performed in all public political and other important events both public and private.However it is not uncommon for only the chorus and verse to be played without repeating the chorus. This is usually the case when brevity is sought. Official 6:00 am and 6:00 pm radio broadcasts of the national anthem invariably use the shorter format. The shorter anthem is also used at international events such as the Olympic Games or World Cup. In ceremonies of the Colombian Artillery the last verse is used instead of the first verse. The Colombian Cavalry traditionally uses the sixth verse while the fourth verse is used by the Colombian Navy. Attempted reforms On 25 September 1997 citizen filed lawsuit of unconstitutionality against ten of the eleven stanzas of the national anthem and inexorability of the regulations that officially adopted it because according to the plaintiff the lyrics constitute an apology for violence and religious discrimination and encourage class struggle. The constitutional court through ruling C-469 declared Law 33 of 1920 which adopted the national anthem enforceable. Responding to the aforementioned demand the Constitutional Court indicated in the judgment The national anthem is poetic-musical composition whose point is to honour historical figures and events that contributed to the emergence of the Colombian nation. Its lyrical inspiration typical of the time of its composition does not adopt normative content of an abstract nature that forces its realisation by the social conglomerate. Materially it does not create extinguish or modify objective and general legal situations its scope is not properly legal and therefore does not go beyond the philosophical historical and patriotic meaning expressed in its stanzas. The anthem as national symbol has been part of the Nation 's cultural heritage for more than century heritage that moreover enjoys the protection of the State. It does not in itself have binding force as norm of positive law. No one is forced then by its stanzas and to pretend otherwise is to fall into the absurd. 2008 bill proposed that citizens be ordered to take firm stance with their heads held high and their right hands over their hearts when listening to the national anthem. The plan was inspired by the gesture that former president Álvaro Uribe usually adopts when singing the national anthem.Another bill that was processed in the Colombian Congress was that presented by Senator Carlos Emiro Barriga of the Second Commission of the Senate of the Republic on 30 April 2009 in which he proposed change to the last lines of the sixth stanza as follows The modification supported by the Academia de Historia de Norte de Santander intended to include in its text General Francisco de Paula Santander as the ruler who has ruled the nation 's destinies for the longest time as president and founder of public education in the country.In 2016 it was proposed to add new stanza in commemoration of the Peace Dialogues that had taken place that year. Versions The first edition of the national anthem published by Oreste Síndici included the scores for singing and piano performances. From then on different transcriptions and versions appeared until the officialisation in 1946 of the scores for symphonic band and military band published by José Rozo Contreras. In addition to these scores Rozo himself published version for cappella mixed choir for soprano alto tenor and bass voices.The national anthem has been performed with an accordion and vallenato rhythm on several occasions notably within the framework of the Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata. Some of these performances have been made by Jorge Celedón Rafael Orozco and Silvestre Dangond. version of the anthem in rock rhythm by the group Ekhymosis of which Juanes was member made in 1995 for the radio station Radioacktiva generated controversy in various media.The animated series El siguiente programa The Following Programme in episode of the second season created the parody the Chibchombia National Anthem known as the Anthem of Corruption. The version of the national anthem on marimba was presented in June 2009 by the secretariat of culture of Valle del Cauca with indigenous rhythms of the Colombian Pacific under the musical direction of Raúl Rosero in the celebration of the centenary of the creation of the department of Valle del Cauca.In the National Concert of the Bicentennial of Colombia in July 2010 different versions of the anthem were heard in various cities of the country in various languages ​​and in various styles of interpretation. The anthem was performed in llanera harp version with the voice of Orlando El Cholo Valderrama and the National Symphony Orchestra in Tame sung cappella by Shakira in the city of Leticia and performed in the Wayuu Choco and San Andrés–Providencia Creole languages among others. Shakira performed the anthem again cappella during the inauguration of the 6th Summit of the Americas at the Cartagena de Indias Convention Center on 14 April 2012. Representations Art The national anthem has been referenced through different artistic manifestations. In poetry two compositions can be mentioned in honour of the national anthem that were published in the newspaper La Pluma de Cali in June 1944 which were included by educator Evangelista Quintana in his article titled La escuela pública da Colombia su Himno Nacional The Public School Gives Colombia Its National Anthem. 308–309 The triumphal arch erected on the Boyacá Bridge is the only monument that contains the lyrics of the national anthem. The arch was built in 1954 by teacher Luis Alberto Acuña and contains the complete notes of the anthem in the lower part which is in the same place the Battle of Boyacá took place.The façade of the Alberto Castilla Music Hall of the Tolima Conservatory located in the historic centre of Ibagué is decorated with stave that contains the musical notes of the national anthem. The building was built between 1932 and 1934 by architect Elí Moreno Otero and was declared Bien de Interés Cultural Site of Cultural Interest by Decree 745 of 24 April 1996.An artistic composition was the reason for stamp in honour of the national anthem issued by the National Postal Administration in 1988 to mark the centenary of the melody. Film One of the first references to the national anthem in film appeared on April 1937 in the film Los primeros ensayos del cine parlante nacional The First Rehearsals of the National Talking Cinema produced by the Acevedo brothers where the National Band directed by José Rozo Contreras performs an instrumental interpretation with the symphonic arrangements that were made official in 1946. The premiere of some first films such as Antonia Santos 1944 was accompanied by live performance of the national anthem.In 2006 controversy arose due to the song Aquí manda el patrón Here the Boss Commands that is used in the film El colombian dream which is based on the music of the national anthem.A short film produced by Rafael Enrique Galán which was selected by the Ministry of Culture in competition by the Cinematographic Development Fund in October 2009 was titled ¡Oh gloria inmarcesible alluding to the first verse of the national anthem. The production participated in the competition within the category of making short films. Notes References External links Colombia Himno Nacional de la República de Colombia ¡Oh gloria inmarcesible.

The work was adopted as the sole official song on 11 May 1813 three years after the May Revolution 11 May is therefore now Anthem Day in Argentina. Some first quite different anthems were composed from 1810 version was then introduced in 1813 which was used throughout the 19th century. What is now officially codified as the state 's national anthem is shorter than the original composition and comprises only the first and last verses and the chorus of the 1813 Patriotic March omitting much emotional text about the struggle for independence from Spain with strong arms they tear to pieces the arrogant Iberian lion. Etymology The third Argentine national anthem was originally named Marcha Patriótica English Patriotic March later renamed Canción Patriótica Nacional English National Patriotic Song and then Canción Patriótica English Patriotic Song. It has been called Himno Nacional Argentino since it was published with that name in 1847. History The first Argentine national anthem was the Patriotic March published on 15 November 1810 in the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres. It had lyrics by Esteban de Luca and music by Blas Parera. This original composition made no reference to the name of Argentina the country was not formally named República Argentina until 1826 although it was referred to as such or an independentist will and talked instead about Spain being conquered by France in the Peninsular War the absolutist restoration begun by the Council of Regency and the need to keep the republican freedoms achieved so far in the Americas Spain was victim of the plotting Gaul because to the tyrants she bent her neck If there treachery has doomed thousands cities let sacred freedom and union reign here Let the father to the sons be able to say enjoy rights that did not enjoy .In mid-1812 the ruling triumvirate ordered the Buenos Aires Cabildo to commission national anthem. Cayetano Rodríguez Franciscan friar wrote text that was approved on August. The Catalan musician Blas Parera music director of the local theater set it to music and performed it for the first time with the orchestra he conducted on November.Less than year later the Assembly of Year XIII estimated that the song was not effective enough to serve as national anthem. On March 1813 several poets were asked to submit lyrics. The poem by the lawyer Vicente López Planes was unanimously considered the best. It was approved as the sole national march única marcha nacional on 11 May 1813. Parera was asked to compose new musical setting around the same date. He must have finished the piece in few days. Oral tradition has it that the premiere took place on 14 May 1813 at the home of the aristocrat Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson but there is no documentary evidence of that. If this is true then Parera contrary to certain misconceptions wrote quickly and under no visible coercion. The published song sheet is dated 14 May 1813. He again conducted the official premiere in the theater on 28 May and was paid 200 pesos. The composition was then known as Canción Patriótica Nacional National Patriotic Song and later simply as Canción Patriótica Patriotic Song but in Juan Pedro Esnaola 's early arrangement dated around 1848 it appeared under the title Himno Nacional Argentino and the name has been retained until today. In the complete version of the Anthem of May as was christened by López it is noted that the political vision portrayed is not only Argentine but Latin American. The lyrics are ardently pro-independence and anti-Spanish as the country was at that time fighting for its independence from Spain.The song became popular immediately. Within ten years documented performances took place throughout Argentina and also in Chile Peru and Colombia until they had their own national anthems. Different versions emerged making mass singing difficult several reforms were then proposed. In 1860 Esnaola was commissioned to create an official version. He took the task to heart making many changes to the music including slower tempo fuller texture alterations to the melody and enrichment of the harmony. In 1927 committee produced historicist version that undid several of Esnaola 's changes but introduced new problems in the sung line. After heated public debate fueled by the newspaper La Prensa this version was rejected and following the recommendations of second committee Esnaola 's arrangement was officially reinstated. In 1944 it was confirmed as the official state anthem. Throughout the 19th century the anthem was sung in its entirety. However once harsh feelings against Spain had dissipated and the country had become home to many Spanish immigrants modification was introduced by decree of President Julio Argentino Roca on 30 March 1900 Without producing alterations in the lyrics of the National Anthem there are in it verses that perfectly describe the concept that nations universally have regarding their anthems in peaceful times and that harmonize with the serenity and dignity of thousands of Spanish that share our living those that can and must be preferred to be sung in official parties for they respect the traditions and the law in no offense to anyone the President of the Republic decrees that In official or public parties as well as in public schools shall be sung only the first and last verses and the chorus of the National Song sanctioned by the General Assembly on May 11 1813. Controversy The song includes line that has given rise to controversy Buenos -- Ayres se pone la frente De los pueblos de la ínclita union. In the manuscript and an early printed song-sheet the word opone is used slightly later version of the song-sheet correcting obvious errors such as spelling mistakes was issued with the same date of 14 May 1813 but with opone changed to pone. The meaning reverses Buenos Aires opposes the front of the people of the union to Buenos Aires positions itself at the front .... The original opone has been interpreted as advancing part of the centralist views in Buenos Aires but has also been considered tragical misprint. In many other lines the anthem goes beyond the Argentine theater of the Spanish American wars of independence and references events in Mexico Central America Northern South America and Upper Peru. The growing ideas of independence are reflected in lines such as On the surface of the earth rises glorious new nation her head is crowned with laurels and Lion lies defeated at her feet. This portrays not just Spanish absolutism but Spain itself as the enemy.The words strongly attacking Spain were no longer sung. Usage Performance of the national anthem is mandatory during all official events and Argentines in attendance are expected to stand up and sing it. Radio broadcasters voluntarily perform the anthem at midnight while TV channels do so before closing down their daily broadcast. On national holidays it is mandatory to perform the national anthem at midnight. The national anthem is ruled in Argentine law by Decree 10302/1944.The rock musician Charly García broke legal regulations dealing with the reproduction of the song when he included an idiosyncratic cover version in his 1990 album Filosofía barata zapatos de goma stirring much controversy. In 1998 various Argentine artists reedited the anthem and other patriotic songs in the joint album El Grito Sagrado. Other singers followed on their footsteps recreating the piece in their own ways. line from the original version of the national anthem was used as the Argentine title of the 1928 film known in English as The Charge of the Gauchos. The national anthem appears at the beginning of the 1985 film The Official Story an Academy Award winner. Short instrumental versions Due to the excessive length of the official version in international events such as the Olympic Games professional soccer games and the Rugby World Cup only the instrumental introduction which lasts minute seconds is played. Another variation is to play the instrumental introductory section followed by the last three lines with the third line repeated or the musical break that leads into the chorus the chorus itself and the coda. In profession soccer games the final part of the anthem is played since 2019. Although traditional these arrangements are not recognized by Argentine law.

Khoemana,ǃOrakobab or Khoemana also known as Korana ǃOra or Griqua is moribund Khoe language of South Africa.,ǃOrakobab or Khoemana also known as Korana ǃOra or Griqua is moribund Khoe language of South Africa. Names Khoemana from khoe 'person mana 'language is more commonly known as either Korana also ǃOrakobab ǃOra Kora Koraqua or Griqua also Gri xri Xri Xiri Xirikwa. The name 'Korana reflects the endonym ǃOra IPA ǃoɾa or ǃGora IPA gǃoɾa referring to the ǃOra people. Sometimes ǃOra is also known as Cape Khoe or Cape Hottentot though the latter has become considered derogatory. The various names are often treated as different languages called South Khoekhoe when taken together but they do not correspond to any actual dialect distinctions and speakers may use Korana and Griqua interchangeably. Both names are also used more broadly for example for the Griqua people. There exist or existed several dialects of Khoemana but the details are unknown. Phonology Khoemana is closely related to Khoekhoe and the sound systems are broadly similar. The strongly aspirated Khoekhoe affricates are simply aspirated plosives tʰ kʰ in Khoemana. However Khoemana has an ejective velar affricate /kxʼʔ/ which is not found in Khoekhoe and corresponding series of clicks /ǀ͡xʼ ǁ͡xʼ ǃ͡xʼ ǂ͡xʼ/. Beach 1938 reported that the Khoekhoe of the time had velar lateral ejective affricate k͡ʟ̝̊ʼ common realisation or allophone of /kxʼ/ in languages with clicks and it might be expected that this is true for Khoemana as well. In addition about half of all lexical words in Khoemana began with click compared to quarter in Khoekhoe. In Korana oe and oa can be pronounced as we and wa. The phoneme can be realized as /c/ before or. An intervocalic and are sometimes realized as /β/. is stated to be alveolar-postalveolar when not followed by close front vowel or. The aspirated phoneme tʰ is realized as an affricate sound /ts/ when followed by close front vowel or. The aspirated sound kʰ can sometimes be realized as kx. Some Griqua speakers may pronounce kʰ as kʼ. The tsʼ sound only seldom occurs. and can occur syllabically as m̩ and n̩. The trilled can also be realized as flapped in some speech. Voicing can be very weak in Khoemana in casual speech so voiced plosives can be hard to distinguish from voiceless plosives.There are four tones in Khoemana Population Reports as to the number of Khoemana speakers are contradictory but it is clear that it is nearly extinct. It was thought to be extinct until the discovery of four elderly speakers around Bloemfontein and Kimberley. 2009 report by Don Killian of the University of Helsinki estimated that there were less than 30 speakers at the time. Matthias Brenzinger reported in 2012 that one possible speaker remained but that she refused to speak the language. The discrepancies could be because the language has multiple dialects and goes by several names with scholars not always referring to the same population. Khoemana is listed as critically endangered in UNESCO 's Language Atlas. The loss of this endangered language would have significant impact on the heritage and culture of Khoemana speakers. Attestation Robust Khoemana before more recent language attrition is principally recorded in an 1879 notebook by Lucy Lloyd which contains five short stories some additional work was done in Ponelis 1975. As of 2009 the EuroBABEL project is searching for remaining speakers. History The people and their language first began to attract scholarly attention in the 1660s coinciding with Dutch colonial efforts in the Cape of Good Hope and the resulting armed conflicts. At the time Khoemana was widely spoken throughout the coastal regions of South Africa. After years of attrition during the colonial era to the 1930s and under apartheid from 1948 to 1994 the language has all but vanished. Currently speakers of Khoemana are not only scarce but scattered due to forced migrations during the apartheid era. This has rendered the language particularly vulnerable.

Because of common ancestor named Griqua and shared links to the Chariguriqua Grigriqua the people officially changed their name to the Griqua. History Origin and early history The Boers arrived in the area of Griquatown after Natal was taken over by the British. They acquired land from the Griqua buying it in exchange for horses liquor firearms and ammunition. Trouble started when the Kok arrested Boer accused of ill-treating his people and the trekker community tried to take over his entire territory. British force stationed at Colesberg quickly crossed the Orange River and defeated the Boers at Zwartkoppies. The arrival of the Boers and the colonial masters to the area known as Griqualand West denied the Griquas the opportunity of following their own development paths. They lost their land and traditional resources and were tossed into sea of rapid social change which saw them lose the independence they had searched for in the Orange Free State area. The Dutch East India Company VOC did not intend for its Cape Colony possessions at the southern tip of Africa to develop into political entity. As the colony expanded and became more successful its leadership did not worry about its frontiers. As result the frontier of the colony was indeterminate and ebbed and flowed at the whim of individuals. While the VOC undoubtedly benefited from the trading and pastoral endeavours of the Trekboers it did little to control or support them in their quest for land. The high proportion of single Dutch men led to many taking indigenous women as wives and companions producing mixed-race children. These multiracial offspring gradually developed as sizable population who spoke Dutch and were instrumental in developing the colony. These children did not attain the social or legal status accorded their fathers mostly because colonial laws recognised only Christian forms of marriage. This group became known as Basters derived from bastaard the Dutch word for bastard or crossbreed. As part of the European colonists paramilitary response to insurgent resistance from Khoi and San peoples they conscripted Basters men into commando units. This allowed the men to become skilled in lightly armed and mounted skirmish tactics. But many recruited to war chose to abandon Dutch society and strike out to pursue way of life more in keeping with their maternal culture. The resulting stream of disgruntled Dutch-speaking marksmen leaving the Cape hobbled the primarily Dutch colonists ability to crew commando units. It also created belligerent skilled groups of opportunists who harassed indigenous populations along the Orange River. Once free of colonial rule these groups referred to themselves as Oorlam. In particular the group led by Klaas Afrikaner became notorious for its exploits. They attracted enough attention from the Dutch authorities that Afrikaner was eventually rendered to the colony and banished to Robben Island in 1761.Hemmy Gysbert in his Latin oration delivered to the Hamburg Academy on 10th April 1767 describes the Hottentots thus This race of men has good physique is swift of foot and averse to hard labour the majority of them succumb to old age except those who fall victim to weapons or wild beasts. In colour they are dark rather than black. They are tall and thin yet so powerful they can withstand the charge of an ox in full career. Their eyes are beautiful but watery their noses flattened their breath foul-smelling. Their teeth are ivory white. Their fingers are equipped with little talons like the claws of eagles. They have graceful ankles and small feet. Their hair is like wool and adorned with pendants or coral and numerous types of trinkets made of lead copper or brass. The great majority of them go about naked or wearing sheepskins they call Krossen and which they wear instead of clothing their private parts they cover with loin cloth known as the Kul-Kross. The woman have pendulous breasts which they can throw over their shoulders and offer to their babies. The chief ornaments of the women are in the form of beads. To protect themselves against the heat of the sun they anoint their faces and bodies with an unguent made of animal fat butter and soot. Some of them live off the raw flesh of animals the rest eat it half-cooked dragging the flesh through their teeth. Griqua migrations The Griquas settled on the outskirts of the Cape Colony since they were neither European or African. They formed their own communities and spoke Afrikaans. The Griqua surnames were predominantly Afrikaans and are still common in the coloured community today. Many of the Griqua men enlisted to do commando service. However the Griquas were constantly being removed off their land as the Europeans took preference over them. This caused the Griquas to move away from the Cape colony in search of their own land. This migration was in two main groups the Kok and Barends families. One of the most influential of these Griqua groups was the Oorlam. In the 19th century the Griqua controlled several political entities which were governed by Kapteins Dutch for Captain and their councils with their own written constitutions. The first Griqua Kaptein was Adam Kok former slave who had bought his own freedom. Kok led his people north from the interior of the Cape Colony likely to escape discrimination before moving north again. As Voortrekker moved North to Natal and finding out the Natal was under British control they had remembered the good lands they had passed through so they moved back over the Drankensberg O'Connel 2013. He eventually led them beyond the Cape Colony near the Orange River just west and south of what would eventually become the Boer Republics of the Orange Free State and Transvaal respectively. This area is where most of the tribe settled although some remained nomadic. Prior to beginning their migrations the Griqua had largely adopted what would be known as the Afrikaans language. Adam Kok head of the Griquas at Nomansland on the demand of the teacher John Campbell concocted the name Griqua. They set up fundamental arrangement of government dependent on pioneers known as kaptyns and officers drawn from the main families. However Kok had rival known as Nicholas Waterboer he ruled the farthest west of Kimberley. He was no threat to Kok until diamonds were discovered there. Kok 's successor Andries Waterboer founded Griqualand West and controlled it until the influx of European after the discovery of diamonds. In 1834 the Cape Colony recognised Waterboer 's rights to his land and people. It signed treaty with him to ensure payment by Europeans for the use of the land for mining. Another important founding father of the Griquas was Barend Barends. He led group of Griquas to fight against Milakazi at Moordkop in the North West Province. The battle led to the deaths of many griquas. Barends was no match for Milikazi and many of the Griqua soldiers died during this battle. Trudie Barends Granddaughter was captured by Milikazi and forced to join Milikazi as his harem. It is rumoured that she was later rescued by missionary Robert Moffet. It is believed that Griqua blood runs through the Ndebele people from the children that Trudie bore during her years with Milikazi. Current situation Despite similarly mixed-race origins those Coloured peoples identifying as Basters are considered to be separate ethnic group and live primarily in south-central Namibia while those who consider themselves Griqua are mostly located around Campbell and Griquatown in the historic territory of Griqualand West in the Northern Cape around the small Le Fleur Griqua settlement at Kranshoek in the Western Cape and at Kokstad in KwaZulu-Natal. Due primarily to the racial policies of South Africa during the apartheid era many Griqua people accepted classification in the larger Coloured group for fear that their Griqua roots might place them at lower level than other groups. As result estimates of the size of the Griqua population are difficult to determine and remain largely unknown. Genetic evidence indicates that the majority of the present-day Griqua population is descended from combination of European Khoikhoi and Tswana ancestors with small percentage of San or Bushmen ancestry.In 1999 the National Khoi-San Council NKC was established and facilitated discussions between these indigenous people and the South African Government. They discussed and collaborated on many issues concerning the Khoi-San people. Griqua people are represented by the National Khoisan Consultative Conference Afrikaans Nasionale Khoe-San Oorlegplegende Konferensie which was established in Oudtshoorn in 2001 to represent the interests of South Africa 's Khoisanid peoples. The conference participates in cooperative research and development projects with the provincial government of the Western Cape and the University of the Free State in Bloemfontein. Members of the influential Le Fleur clan of Griqua are especially represented in this body. The Griqua established their own church known as the Griqua Church which is Protestant. The Church has strong focus on maintaining Griqua cultural and ethnic identity. They are represented mostly in South Central Namibia.One of several disputed theories as to the origin of Bloemfontein 's name connects it to the Griqua leader Jan Bloem 1775–1858. However this may be coincidence as Bloemfontein is Dutch for fountain of flowers or blooming fountain and the area could have been named for its local vegetation. Griqualand Several areas of South Africa became known as 'Griqualand when the group migrated inland from the Cape and established separate communities. The Griqua were first from the Cape to make their way to and remain in the Transorangia area beyond the Orange River. Griqualand East officially known as New Griqualand was one of four short-lived Griqua states in Southern Africa from the early 1860s until the late 1870s and was located between the Umzimkulu and Kinira Rivers south of the Sotho Kingdom.Is the area around Kokstad on KwaZulu-Natal 's frontier with the Eastern Cape. It was historical division in the Eastern Cape province approximately 19000 km2. This area was named after Adam Kok III. In 1861–1862 Kok III led more than 2,000 Griqua through Basutoland over the Drakensberg mountains. They settled on piece of unclaimed territory between Pondoland and Natal which subsequently became known as Griqualand East. The region remained independent for few years before the territory was annexed by Britain. Griqua descendants are now largely concentrated in Kokstad where the Griqua Church is center of the community. Griqualand West is the area around Kimberley which became an important mining town in the decades following the first local discovery of diamonds in 1866. Kimberley is also known for its sports teams including the Griquas rugby team which competes in South Africa 's annual Currie Cup tournament and contests its home matches at Griqua Park. With the arrival of the Boers to Griqualand West the Griqua lost their land and traditional cultures and were tossed into rapidly changing Orange Free State area South Africa History Online 2020. The Griqua nation Map indicating Griqualand West is known to have made use of flags before 1902 when they adopted flag similar to the Zuid Afrikaansche Republiek ZAR. Griquas living in this area were under the leadership of Anndries but they are not known to have used flags.

¿Por qué no te callas?,¿Por qué no te callas. Spanish poɾˈke no te ˈkaʎas English Why do n't you shut up. is phrase that was uttered by King Juan Carlos of Spain to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez at the 2007 Ibero-American Summit in Santiago Chile when Chávez was repeatedly interrupting Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero 's speech. Following international attention the phrase became an overnight sensation gaining cult and meme status as mobile-phone ringtone spawning domain name contest T-shirt sales television program and YouTube videos.,"¿Por qué no te callas. Spanish poɾˈke no te ˈkaʎas English Why do n't you shut up. is phrase that was uttered by King Juan Carlos of Spain to Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez at the 2007 Ibero-American Summit in Santiago Chile when Chávez was repeatedly interrupting Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero 's speech. Following international attention the phrase became an overnight sensation gaining cult and meme status as mobile-phone ringtone spawning domain name contest T-shirt sales television program and YouTube videos. Incident At the meeting on 10 November 2007 Chávez repeatedly interrupted Zapatero to call Zapatero 's predecessor José María Aznar fascist and less human than snakes and accuse Aznar of having supported failed coup d'état aimed at removing Chávez from power. Zapatero had earlier irritated Chávez by suggesting that Latin America needed to attract more foreign capital to combat its chronic deepening poverty and claimed that Chávez 's policies scared investors out of Latin America.Chávez 's attacks became so strong that Zapatero rose to Aznar 's defence even though he had been severely critical of Aznar in the past. Zapatero pointed out that Aznar had been democratically elected and was legitimate representative of the Spanish people .Although organizers switched off Chávez 's microphone he continued to interrupt as Zapatero defended Aznar. Juan Carlos leaned forward turned towards Chávez and said ¿Por qué no te callas. The King 's rebuke received applause from the general audience. He addressed Chávez using the familiar form of you in Latin American Spanish tú and te are usually used in informal chat among young people or when addressing close friends family or children and can be perceived as insulting when used in other circumstances. However in European Spanish the use of tú is more extended and considered the standard. Shortly thereafter he left the hall as Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega accused Spain of intervention in his country 's elections and complained about the presence of Spanish energy companies in Nicaragua. The incident was unprecedented as never before had the King displayed such anger in public.For the King the incident was part of an annus horribilis for the royal image according to the Chilean newspaper La Nación. The New York Times argued that the incident exposed the unendingly complicated relations between Spain and its former colonies. Reaction After the events at the summit Hugo Chávez made statements against King Juan Carlos questioning his democratic legitimacy and whether he knew about and endorsed the attempted coup d'état in Venezuela in 2002. Chávez defended his accusations against Aznar arguing that prohibiting criticism of an elected official such as Aznar would be similar to prohibiting criticism of Hitler. He stated that he would revise Venezuela 's position towards Spain and increase surveillance of the activities of Spanish companies in Venezuela where Spain had been the main investor and trade partner in the last decade.The Spanish government showed appreciation for the reaction of the King and for Zapatero 's defense of the dignity of Spanish elected representatives like Aznar.Several days after the event Chávez demanded an apology from King Juan Carlos and warned Spain that he would review diplomatic ties and take action against Spanish investments such as Banco Santander and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria in Venezuela. He accused the King of displaying the kind of Spanish arrogance that led to Spain 's ejection from South America at the hands of Venezuela 's hero Simón Bolívar. Spanish diplomats were concerned that Chávez would replace his socialism and attacks on American Imperialism with attacks on what he called Spanish imperialism. Speaking about Venezuela 's indigenous peoples Chávez said of the Spanish They slit our people 's throats and chopped them into little bits and left them on the outskirts of towns and villages that was what the Spanish empire did here. The Spanish foreign ministry denied that the ¿Por qué no te callas. incident was indicative of Spanish–Latin American relations. Some analysts say Chávez used such incidents to fire up his support base among the majority poor at home with blunt language that played on their misgivings of rich countries investments in Latin America .According to the Los Angeles Times it is uncertain which of the two men came out of the incident looking worse Chávez for his boorish lack of etiquette or the King for insulting another leader. The King 's words raised questions as the 200th anniversary of independence for the former Spanish colonies approached. Several days after the incident Venezuela 's state-run television ran footage of Juan Carlos with Francisco Franco. The King was depicted as the dictator 's lackey but the fact that the Spanish Constitution of 1978 which preserved the monarchy had been approved by referendum and the key role played by the King in putting down an attempted military coup in 1981 were not mentioned.The King 's outburst received divided reactions from other leaders. Brazil 's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva defended Chávez while Peru 's and El Salvador 's presidents Alan García and Antonio Saca supported the King. Popularity of phrase Zapatero said he did not realize what an influential moment it had been until he returned home and his eldest daughter greeted him with ¿Por qué no te callas. which made them both laugh.The King 's phrase gained cult slogan status ringing from mobile phones appearing on T-shirts and being used as greeting. The domain porquenotecallas.com had reached US 4,600 on eBay as of 16 November 2007. The phrase became YouTube sensation overnight and song was written to traditional tune. The phrase spawned countless media articles jokes songs and video clips and in Spain an estimated 500,000 people downloaded the phrase as ringtone generating €1.5 million US million in sales as of November 2007. As of 14 November 2007 Google generated 665,000 webhits on the phrase and YouTube had 610 videos. Entrepreneurs in Florida and Texas put the slogan on T-shirts and marketed them on eBay and elsewhere the phrase became greeting among Venezuelan expats in Miami and Spain and slogan for Chávez opponents.Less than 24 hours after the event the king 's words were used by sports commentators during the radio transmission of Spanish language football games to describe controversial events. contest for the best audiovisual depiction of the event was announced in Spain. The Cincinnati Enquirer editorial page suggested that the phrase would have the power to change the course of history as has been credited to Ronald Reagan 's Mr. Gorbachev tear down this wall. The Los Angeles Times said the Spanish-speaking world can hardly stop talking about the incident which provided fodder for satirists from Mexico City to Madrid. An editor for the Washington Post noted the Spanish-speaking world has been abuzz about this verbal slapdown and suggested that King Juan Carlos should have asked the assembled heads of state 'Why do n't you speak up. The reaction was apparent in newspaper headlines cable television and on YouTube. His phrase was reproduced on T-shirts and cellphone ring tones. In Mexico City the dust-up became satirical skit El Chabo del. In El Salvador 's capital the phrase became playful greeting. In Australia The Sydney Morning Herald reported the King could earn multimillion-euro business if he claimed rights over the phrase which generated Benny Hill Show-style skit and Nike ad Juan do it. Just shut up with the Brazilian football star Ronaldinho. Canada 's CBC News said an actor 's voice was used to mimic the king 's voice in the ringtone to avoid legal problems over the use of the phrase which also generated sales of coffee mugs.Protesters against the Chávez government adopted the phrase as their slogan T-shirts in Venezuela had the slogan with the no in capital letters representing call to vote against amendments in the December 2007 constitutional referendum and the phrase was used as taunt when more than 100,000 marched in protest against Chávez 's proposed constitutional changes. Aftermath Immediate One week after the event The Wall Street Journal wrote that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia delivered Chávez 's second rebuke from king in one week when he reminded Chávez that oil should not be used as tool for conflict. The remarks came minutes after Chávez called for OPEC to assert itself as an active political agent at the OPEC summit in Saudi Arabia 's capital Riyadh. In followup at the OPEC summit Reuters wrote that Spain 's king can not shut Chavez up but bladder can and that Chávez said to throng of reporters at the OPEC summit For while now have needed to go to the bathroom and am going to pee ... Do you want me to pee on you. Two weeks after the event Chile 's President Michelle Bachelet revealed that she had politely requested that Chávez abstain from making some statements at the summit indicating frankly that she felt let down by the subsequent discussions at the OPEC meeting considering the effect that the price of oil has on countries like Chile. Also just weeks after the incident Chávez was accused of breaking protocol accord with Colombia 's President Álvaro Uribe and exhaust ing his Colombian counterpart 's patience by speaking out of turn once too often formally ending Chávez 's mediation in hostage negotiations with the Colombian Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia FARC guerrilla group.In Argentina television program called Por qué no te callas began broadcasting on December 2007. Enduring The phrase was seen at the 2010 FIFA World Cup when Spanish fan raised scarf bearing the slogan. In 2013 Infobae named the incident among those most noted to have captured public attention in the history of the Ibero-American Summit. Entorno Inteligente invoked the phrase in 2014 paying homage to Spain for the immortal lexicon and referring to Venezuelan politician Nicolás Maduro as in-maduro play on the Spanish word immature. 2020 Spanish newspaper characterized the incident as one of the 20 most memorable televised moments of Juan Carlos.A 2017 journal paper used the incident as an example of the definition of intensification as pragmatic strategy that contributes to the rhetorico–argumentative aspect reinforcing what has been said or the speaker 's or somebody else 's point of view. study published in 2019 in the journal Normas about the expression of courtesy in language remarked that neither party had measured the impact their words would have during the summit. Alternative forms According to Fundéu BBVA the Urgent Spanish Foundation and the director of the Chilean Academy of the Spanish language the phrase uttered by the King given the situation under which it was said should be written with exclamation marks instead of question marks ¡Por qué no te callas. Alternatively it could be written using combination of both exclamation and question marks the interrobang ¡¿Por qué no te callas. or ¿¡Por qué no te callas.

As kind of Siddhartha of Hermann Hesse Maria del Carmen goes from group to group looking for sense for her life. The first group she found is of Marxists who used to go by the streets of Cali or Bogotá with backpacks untidy hair and Das Kapital to read anywhere to anyone who dare to listen to them as kind of preachers. She got bored of this first team and abandoned them soon to look more pure emotions She came to the rock world imported to the city by the children of parents who were able to study in the US and return to Cali wearing gang clothes. Maria del Carmen became part of gang to try any kind of drugs while listening to the Rolling Stones. References External links HERNÁNDEZ Adriana ¡Qué viva la música. La escritura desde abajo.

Contents README file typically encompasses Configuration instructions Installation instructions Operating instructions file manifest list of files in the directory or archive Copyright and licensing information Contact information for the distributor or author list of known bugs Troubleshooting instructions Credits and acknowledgments changelog usually aimed at fellow programmers news section usually aimed at end users History It is unclear when the convention of including README file began but examples dating to the mid-1970s have been found. Early Macintosh system software installed Read Me on the Startup Disk and README files commonly accompanied third-party software. In particular there is long history of free software and open-source software including README file the GNU Coding Standards encourage including one to provide general overview of the package .Since the advent of the web as de facto standard platform for software distribution many software packages have moved or occasionally copied some of the above ancillary files and pieces of information to website or wiki sometimes including the README itself or sometimes leaving behind only brief README file without all of the information required by new user of the software. The popular source code hosting website GitHub strongly encourages the creation of README file if one exists in the main top-level directory of repository it is automatically presented on the repository 's front page. In addition to plain text various other formats and file extensions are also supported and HTML conversion takes extensions into account in particular README.md is treated as GitHub Flavored Markdown. As generic term The expression readme file is also sometimes used generically for other files with similar purpose. For example the source-code distributions of many free software packages especially those following the Gnits Standards or those produced with GNU Autotools include standard set of readme files Also commonly distributed with software packages are an FAQ file and TODO file which lists planned improvements.

Abe is shown eating big container of cole slaw.

Through the course of the sketches we learn that Abe Scheinwald has passed on numerous blockbusters that Brad had attempted to encourage him to back including Titanic The Lord of the Rings trilogy The Matrix trilogy and many others allowing other studios to successfully back them much to the ever-increasing frustration of Brad.

Appalachian Emergency Room Appalachian Emergency Room is recurring sketch that debuted on January 10 2004 an episode hosted by Jennifer Aniston and draws on redneck stereotypes. Recurring characters The emergency room receptionist Seth Meyers in blond mullet wig has appeared in every sketch so far. He simply sits at the desk and plays the straight man to the other characters. He is also portrayed as relatively articulate and intelligent. On the Matt Dillon/Arctic Monkeys episode the receptionist 's name is revealed to be Nerod. Willie Tater Fred Armisen only appeared in two installments of Appalachian Emergency Room on the Liam Neeson/Modest Mouse episode he comes in with an ice pack on his crotch explaining that his penis slipped into deep fryer while he was making breakfast and on the Lindsay Lohan/Coldplay episode he has an ice pack on his face after playing Star Wars with his brother using curling irons as lightsabers. Mrs. Denmont Maya Rudolph and her son Jake Kenan Thompson have appeared in the majority of the sketches. The first time Rudolph 's character was shown was in the Ben Affleck/N episode in Season 29. In that episode she was not called Mrs. Denmont her son was white boy with mullet instead of Kenan Thompson 's Jake character and she came in with tampon machine stuck to her hand revealing that she got it stuck while trying to fish out the tampon when the machine ate her quarter. It was n't until the episode hosted by Snoop Dogg also in season 29 that Maya Rudolph 's character was paired up with Kenan 's Jake character and that she was known as Mrs. Denmont. In the Matt Dillon/Arctic Monkeys episode Rudolph and Thompson play the same characters but their names are changed. Netty Bo Dance Amy Poehler and Percy Bo Dance Darrell Hammond elderly tenants of trailer park appear in every sketch so far. Percy always explains an injury he sustained from his druggie son played by Neil Young in the Jack Black/Neil Young episode but was never shown before that episode and has n't been shown since. Based on his explanation it always appears that Netty should have also sustained severe injury yet only Percy ever appears to be hurt. Netty Bo Dance has very slow humorous shuffle-walk and frequently declares that she will keep the hospital gown as dress. Tyler Chris Parnell appears in nearly every sketch and is greeted by the receptionist with the question What is it this time Tyler. Tyler proceeds to explain how some implausible object has wedged its way into his anus although in the Jack Black/Neil Young episode Tyler actually has gift-wrapped watermelon stuck to his penis. In the Ben Affleck/N episode Tyler explains that it is canister of Axe Body Spray and that if he moves in certain way he can still make it spray. In the May 21 2005 episode he re-emerges from the examination room that he was sent to and declares that he now has about 20 cotton balls up his rectum but adds it 's OK though they 're in glass jar. Episodes featuring Appalachian Emergency Room January 10 2004 host Jennifer Aniston as Taytay Phillips pregnant woman brought in after she fell on toilet seat after jackknifing off Big Wheel.

NOTE There was supposed to be an Appalachian Emergency Room sketch on the Peyton Manning/Carrie Underwood episode in season 32 despite that Chris Parnell is n't there to play frequent patient Tyler where Manning interrupts the sketch to speak out against its redneck stereotyping but it never appeared in the live show airing. The Prince Show The Prince Show is sketch parodying the memorable performance of Prince and Beyoncé at the 46th Grammy Awards. The sketch features Fred Armisen as the host playing Prince and with Maya Rudolph as his co-host Beyoncé. The opening theme song of the show features Prince playing his famous purple guitar with his famed symbol. After the song is over the two head to purple couch which coincides with much of the rest of the set which is also purple. Prince rarely says much on the show usually whispering into Beyoncé 's ear what he wants to say. Prince usually has two guests. Prince soon gets tired of his first guest and whispers into Beyoncé 's ear. Beyoncé tells the guest that Prince wants him/her to do something outrageous and the guest usually complies. During most of the sketches Prince vanishes during an important conversation. The guest asks Beyoncé Hey where did Prince go. Beyoncé tells the guest that Prince is nearby doing unrelated activities such as sculpting or painting. After Prince brings out his second guest the first one tells Prince he or she was enjoying doing whatever ridiculous activity that Prince made him/her do. Debuted February 14 2004. An installment of this sketch appeared on the season 31 episode hosted by Steve Martin with the real Prince as musical guest. The genuine article did not appear in the sketch.

The real Prince was musical guest on this episode and the writers wanted him to appear as Prince 's Armisen 's reflection in mirror but he refused. They decided to go with the sketch anyway simply using an actual mirror. Apr. 14 2007 Host Shia LaBeouf as Tobey Maguire. ¡Show Biz Grande Explosion. ¡Show Biz Grande Explosion. is recurring sketch featuring Fred Armisen as Fericito and Horatio Sanz as Manuel Pantalones who are Latin-American entertainers and comedians. ¡Show Biz Grande Explosion. was launched as vehicle for Armisen 's Fericito character nightclub comedian from Venezuela which had appeared three times on Saturday Night Live already and was quite popular. The sketch is presented as being Spanglish show airing on the Univisión network and is parody of Latin American variety shows such as Sabado Gigante. This is the only sketch Fericito has appeared in although he has also been in monologues and on Weekend Update.Manuel introduces Fericito and the bit. Fericito plays his timbales and asks the audience Did you feel it. Fericito then goes into monologue with jokes. At the end of each joke he says ¡Ay Dios Mio. and makes an exaggerated sad face. If someone becomes offended by joke he makes Fericito says jus kidding. while shrugging. Often Manuel or the guest of the night is the butt of these jokes. After his monologue Fericito interviews special guest. Often the guest is an outsider to Latin Culture who does not understand the nature or format of Fericito 's jokes or the guest him- or herself will try to crack joke which Fericito and Manuel do not find funny. Episodes March 2004 host Colin Firth as himself May 2004 host Snoop Dogg as himself December 11 2004 host Colin Farrell as Bono October 2005 host Jon Heder as himself Debbie Downer Rachel Dratch sketch. Debuted May 2004. Kaitlin Rick Amy Poehler plays hyperactive little girl in the care of her beleaguered stepfather Horatio Sanz. Debuted May 2004. The theme of these sketches was how extremely opposite the personalities of the two main characters were. Pre-teen Kaitlin was extremely hyper constantly chattering rapidly running around jumping on and over furniture etc. By contrast her stepfather Rick was completely laid back and calm. He was utterly indifferent to Kaitlin 's hyper antics and extremely patient with her. In fact he was portrayed as an extraordinarily patient and good stepfather. When he did apply discipline it was in his super calm laid back style. It appeared that Amy Poehler would often deviate from the script and make Kaitlin even more out of control and hyper than originally scripted or rehearsed in an attempt to make Horatio Sanz break. For example in one sketch Poehler pressed her face hard against Sanz face such that her forehead was on his temple and her nose on his cheek and in croaking frog-like voice rapidly said rickrickrickrickrickrickrickrick .... until Sanz broke character and started laughing. Kaitlin 's catch phrase and schtick was to rapidly run in circles around Rick yelling his name Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. If the episode 's host was female she played friend of Kaitlin 's. If male he played friend of Rick 's. In either case the character played by the host was peppered with absurd rapid fire questions by Kaitlin. In the final installment of this sketch Rick did n't appear and host Molly Shannon played her mother whom had never appeared before. Completely unlike Rick her mother was every bit as hyper as Kaitlin resulting in utterly out of control hyperness in this last sketch. Appearances May 2004 Host Lindsay Lohan October 30 2004 Host Kate Winslet January 22 2005 Host Paul Giamatti April 16 2005 Host Tom Brady October 2005 Host Jon Heder May 2006 Host Tom Hanks May 12 2007 Host Molly Shannon Shannon played Kaitlin 's mother. Jorge Rodriguez An alleged expert on world events Jorge Rodriguez is an aloof halfwit played by Horatio Sanz that constantly falls for the various hare-brained schemes of his friend Pepe. His catchphrase is 'm looking for Pepe. Debuted May 2004. Pat 'N Patti Silviac Horatio Sanz and Maya Rudolph play Pat and Patti Silviac owners of small retail store. Debuted May 15 2004. The object of these sketches appeared to be to challenge the writers to come up with dialog with the most occurrences of the sound ack in as few words as possible. Pat and Patti would present an advertisement for their business in which the sound ack would appear incredibly frequently in the dialog several times per sentence on average. Example Pat 'n Patti 's Backpack Shack is in Hackensack next to the dog track. All of their employees would have surnames that ended in the sound ack as of course Silviac also did. The commercials would conclude with an invitation to visit their website which had the fictional domain suffix .ack. Appearances May 15 2004 Hosts Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen as employees Mattie and Jackie Halderback. Jimmy Fallon as employee Jack Kakinstack. Business Pat 'n Patti 's Backpack Shack. December 11 2004 Host Colin Farrell as employee Zack Kakinstack. Business Pat 'n Patti 's Slacks Snacks and Knick Knack shack. References.

Debuted May 2004. Kaitlin Rick Amy Poehler plays hyperactive little girl in the care of her beleaguered stepfather Horatio Sanz. Debuted May 2004. The theme of these sketches was how extremely opposite the personalities of the two main characters were. Pre-teen Kaitlin was extremely hyper constantly chattering rapidly running around jumping on and over furniture etc. By contrast her stepfather Rick was completely laid back and calm. He was utterly indifferent to Kaitlin 's hyper antics and extremely patient with her. In fact he was portrayed as an extraordinarily patient and good stepfather. When he did apply discipline it was in his super calm laid back style. It appeared that Amy Poehler would often deviate from the script and make Kaitlin even more out of control and hyper than originally scripted or rehearsed in an attempt to make Horatio Sanz break. For example in one sketch Poehler pressed her face hard against Sanz face such that her forehead was on his temple and her nose on his cheek and in croaking frog-like voice rapidly said rickrickrickrickrickrickrickrick .... until Sanz broke character and started laughing. Kaitlin 's catch phrase and schtick was to rapidly run in circles around Rick yelling his name Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. Rick. If the episode 's host was female she played friend of Kaitlin 's. If male he played friend of Rick 's. In either case the character played by the host was peppered with absurd rapid fire questions by Kaitlin. In the final installment of this sketch Rick did n't appear and host Molly Shannon played her mother whom had never appeared before. Completely unlike Rick her mother was every bit as hyper as Kaitlin resulting in utterly out of control hyperness in this last sketch.

They perform My Little Buttercup at the cantina confusing the locals. The German 's real associates arrive at the cantina proving themselves lethal with their pistols when everybody laughs at them. Relieved Carmen picks up the Amigos and takes them to the village where they are pampered in the best house in town.

Fred Asparagus as The Bartender Norbert Weisser and Brian Thompson as The German 's friends Randy Newman as Voice of the Singing Bush Rebecca Underwood as Hot Senorita kisses Ned at the close of the film Production The film was written by Martin Michaels and Randy Newman. According to Michaels Martin approached him with the idea for the film and asked him to co-write it. Martin originally had the working title Three Caballeros the same as the Disney cartoon. Newman contributed three original songs The Ballad of the Three Amigos My Little Buttercup and Blue Shadows on the Trail and the musical score was composed by Elmer Bernstein. It was shot outside Grants New Mexico and in Simi Valley California Coronado National Forest Old Tucson Studios Culver City and Hollywood.John Landis was on trial over the Twilight Zone tragedy during the editing of Three Amigos and the studio heavily edited the film down after he submitted his final cut.Martin 's performance of the lasso tricks during the movie was skill he had learned when he was working at Disneyland in his 20s.The production went through many cast changes before filming. Martin had been attached to the project since 1980 and he Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi were originally going to star. At one point Steven Spielberg was slated to direct he wanted Martin Bill Murray and Robin Williams to play Lucky Dusty and Ned respectively. Landis has said that Rick Moranis would have been cast as Ned had Short been unavailable. When Aykroyd became unavailable Chase replaced him. John Candy was set for the role originally intended for Belushi but was too large to ride horse. Candy recommended Short to Martin as they had worked together at SCTV. Martin and Short became close friends and continue to perform together. Candy was later seen riding horse in the 1991 film Delirious. While Steve Martin has top billing in some posters as well as DVD covers today Chevy Chase has top billing in the film itself. Martin reportedly developed tinnitus after filming pistol-shooting scene. But in an interview with Pitchfork he clarified that the tinnitus was from years of listening to loud music and performing for noisy crowds.There were difficulties between the main actors and Landis. Most famously Chase refused to tell particular joke that he thought would make his character look like moron. Chase agreed to do the line after Landis threatened to give it to Short instead. Chase recalled making hideous insult about Landis 's supposed lack of stunt precautions at 50-foot cliff in reference to Landis 's ongoing Twilight Zone accidental death trial which Landis overheard on live microphone and nearly started fistfight over. Chase later said that making this movie was the most fun 've ever had. Deleted scenes Several deleted scenes were included in the Blu-ray release. An alternative opening features Santo Poco being pillaged by El Guapo and his men prompting Carmen 's search for help. Extended sequences of the Three Amigos at the studio mansion and backlot lead into another deleted subplot involving an up-and-coming rival actress at the studio Miss Rene Fran Drescher. billboard featuring Miss Rene film is visible when the Amigos steal their costumes from the studio. number of deleted scenes featuring Sam Kinison as mountain man were lost as were most of Drescher 's other scenes. Music Elmer Bernstein wrote the score for Three Amigos and Randy Newman wrote the songs.

The site 's critical consensus reads Three Amigos. stars trio of gifted comedians and has an agreeably silly sense of humor but they 're often adrift in dawdling story with too few laugh-out-loud moments. On Metacritic it has weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 13 critics indicating mixed or average reviews. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade on an A+ to scale.Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film one star out of four writing The ideas to make Three Amigos into good comedy are here but the madness is missing. Janet Maslin of The New York Times wrote that it was likable but lacked distinctive style though certain jokes are crafted with enjoyable sophistication. Caroline Wetsbrook of Empire awarded the film three out of five stars and wrote that it was good-natured enough to sustain its ultimately thin premise .The film has since been reviewed more favorably and has become cult classic. Neil McNally of the website Den of Geek noted that the film was unfairly overlooked when first released and praised the performances of Martin Chase and Short the comedic timing of Landis 's direction and Bernstein 's sweeping majestic score. The film was ranked 79th on Bravo 's list of the 100 Funniest Movies.

Mexican Liberal Party,The Mexican Liberal Party PLM Spanish Partido Liberal Mexicano was started in August 1900 when engineer Camilo Arriaga published manifesto entitled Invitacion al Partido Liberal Invitation to the Liberal Party. The invitation was addressed to Mexican liberals who were dissatisfied with the way the Porfirio Díaz government was deviating from the liberal Constitution of 1857. Arriaga called on Mexican liberals to form local liberal clubs which would then send delegates to liberal convention.The first Mexican Liberal Party Convention was held in San Luis Potosí in February 1901. Fifty local clubs from thirteen states sent 56 delegates. The Convention delegates affirmed their liberal beliefs in free speech free press and free assembly. They objected to the close workings of the Diaz government and the Catholic Church. The convention produced fifty-one resolutions which called for the organization of the new Liberal Party propagation of liberal principles development of means to combat the political influence of the clergy establishment of means to improve the administration of justice proposals calling for guarantees of the rights of citizens and real freedom of the press and proposals favoring complete self-government at the local level. They also called for support for free secular education in the primary schools the spread of liberal ideas among the lower classes the establishment of liberal publications and the taxation of Church income.Ricardo Flores Magón attended the first Convention as reporter for his newspaper Regeneración Regeneration. He afterwards published an editorial in favorable support of the aims and aspirations. In April 1901 the new Mexican Liberal Party opened branch in Mexico City and Ricardo Flores Magón and his brothers joined and became active members. Always bit more radical than most members Flores Magón was forced into exile in January 1904. Finally settling in San Antonio Texas Flores Magón called for radical members of the Liberal Party to follow him in new organization. In September 1905 the radical liberals led by Flores Magón formed new organization called Junta Organizadora del Partido Liberal Mexicano PLM. This organization would be separate from the Liberal Party and it would seek to coordinate the violent overthrow of the Díaz government.

In September 1905 the radical liberals led by Flores Magón formed new organization called Junta Organizadora del Partido Liberal Mexicano PLM. This organization would be separate from the Liberal Party and it would seek to coordinate the violent overthrow of the Díaz government. The MLP was involved in strikes and uprisings in Mexico from 1906 to 1911. Overview The party controlled the northern part of Baja California in 1911 including Tijuana Mexicali and Tecate. In August 1911 part of the MLP militants including Juan Sarabia Jesús Flores Magón and Antonio Díaz Soto Gama split from the organization and transformed into the Liberal Party Spanish Partido Liberal .The MLP was supported from exile in Texas by the feminist writer Andrea Villarreal. Background In February 1901 the Liberal Congress was founded in San Luis Potosí in which representatives of fourteen states of the Mexican Republic demanded to dismiss the postulates of the Constitution of 1857. Dozens of liberal clubs were created throughout the country and an attempt was made to establish Confederation of Liberal Circles but the following year its founders were arrested. Porfirio Díaz severely repressed the entire opposition and in 1902 he was re-elected as president of Mexico for the third time. By 1904 the police persecution of the Diaz government its political opponents were forced to seek refuge abroad coupled with the growing political differences between the liberals group headed by Camilo Arriaga went into exile in San Antonio Texas and another headed by Ricardo Flores Magón in the border city of Laredo. Diaz agents backed by US authorities chased liberals in Texas so they continued to move further and further north. On 28 September 1905 in Saint Louis Missouri United States the Magón Flores group drafted the manifesto with which the Organizing Board of the Mexican Liberal Party was constituted. The tasks of the Organizing Board were to summon and articulate all the opposing forces to prepare the fight against the dictator. On July 1906 after almost year of discussion on the political economic and social situation of the country the Manifesto and Program of the Mexican Liberal Party was published. Among the main policies of the program were the eight-hour day prohibition of child labor minimum wage compensation for accidents at work compulsory and free secular education. Years later these policies presented by the PLM in this program formed the basis of the 1917 Constitution of Mexico which officially ended the Mexican Revolution. Strikes and Insurrections The PLM organized several uprisings against the Porfirio Díaz regime all of which were violently repressed. The PLM Program influenced the Cananea strike and Río Blanco strike as well as the Acayucan rebellion. On 16 September the PLM initiated their revolutionary plan. When the groups operating in the United States took over the main border customs and reinforced the supply of weapons the 44 guerilla groups totalling 2200 fighters all over the republic would rise up in arms. However most of the liberals were discovered by the US police who seized weapons and documents that discovered the insurrection plans so it had to be postponed. 26 September was set as the new date to start the Revolution. group of liberals attacked Jiménez but after few hours federal forces arrived outnumbering and forcing them to flee. Other attacks were carried out in Monclova Zaragoza Piedras Negras and other small towns in Coahuila to similar results. On 30 September the Acayucan rebellion began led by Hilario C. Salas and Cándido Donato Padua PLM delegates from Veracruz and Tabasco. In Acayucan the clashes against the army lasted days. Most of the rebels died some fled to the Soteapan mountain range where they reorganized the guerrilla war continuing the fight until 1911. On 16 October third insurrectional attempt was made in Camargo which was also defeated. On 19 October the group from El Paso organized by Ricardo Flores Magón ventured into Ciudad Juarez but were discovered crossing the border by federal soldiers who were already aware of the uprising. The next day the rest of the insurgents were arrested in El Paso by immigration agents and Pinkerton detectives but Magón managed to escape. On 24 June 1908 the PLM attacked Viesca but were repelled and defeated. The leaders were apprehended and sent to the political prison of San Juan de Ulúa in Veracruz. On 26 June the liberals attacked Acuña Casas Grandes and Palomas. There was also belligerent PLM activity in Oaxaca Puebla Tlaxcala and Morelos. The railroad strike that paralyzed the northern part of the country that year was also influenced by the PLM. Pinkerton agent in St. Louis declared that in 1908 180 members of the PLM had been arrested and placed in Mexican prisons so the danger of revolution had passed. But in 1909 Práxedis G. Guerrero published series of manifestos aimed at the workers of the world and urged Mexicans to rise up in rebellion. The most effective weapon of the PLM was the press. Even in exile it had at least publications in different locations all of which were gradually suppressed by the authorities. The Mexican Libertarian Army For the Mexican Liberal Party simply overthrowing dictator Porfirio Díaz was n't enough if it did not guarantee communal freedom. They understood that the struggle for political freedom was useless if economic freedom did n't come with it so in order to guarantee that freedom it would be necessary to take and defend the land in an armed rebellion. The armed groups of the PLM were organized into the Liberal Army Confederation also known as the Mexican Libertarian Army. On 23 September 1910 the PLM Organizing Board in Los Angeles published in Regeneration libertarian manifesto that called on Mexicans to fight against the State the Clergy and Capital under the slogan Land and Freedom an ideal that month later was taken up by Emiliano Zapata. The most important military campaign of the Mexican Liberal Army was the Baja Revolution. Mexicans and volunteers of other nationalities participated in this anarchist and socialist revolution reason that gave rise to the authorities intensifying their repression of the PLM. By refusing to recognize the Treaties of Ciudad Juárez the PLM guerrillas were persecuted and exterminated by the federal army and Maderist groups during the provisional government of Francisco León de la Barra who requested support from the United States government to transfer Mexican troops through American territory and attack the Baja revolution on two fronts. The military campaigns of the PLM failed again and again due to the lack of resources police infiltration and confusion caused by counterproductive tactics. Although for some Maderism represented the most viable political alternative for others supporting Madero was simply the only way to escape alive from Mexican prisons. However there were others who preferred jail or death to betraying their ideals. Final years After the raid on Baja California and with Ricardo Flores Magón Librado Rivera and Anselmo Figueroa in jail there were other armed uprisings on behalf of the PLM. Such was the case of Primitivo Gutiérrez who on February 1912 on behalf of the PLM repealed the Constitution and declared anarchist communism in the town of Las Vacas Coahuila. In 1913 PLM groups attempted to launch themselves back into the armed struggle. While attempting to enter Mexico from Texas they faced group of rangers were defeated and sentenced to 50 years or more of prison. However these actions had no major impact on the development of events in Mexico the PLM 's role in the Mexican Revolution drew to close. In 1915 after the death of Anselmo L. Figueroa and the lack of resources to continue Regeneration small group of the PLM moved to farm located in Edendale Los Angeles. There they lived and worked communally raised chickens and grew vegetables that they sold for support while carrying out the political work of the PLM now renamed the Revolutionary Workers Union UOR .In February 1916 Enrique and Ricardo Flores Magón were arrested at their home in Edendale accused of defaming Venustiano Carranza. They were released months later when committee promoted by Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman collected the bail money demanded by the Los Angeles court. Shortly after leaving prison Enrique Flores Magón left the UOR along with most others. Librado Rivera and Ricardo Flores Magón remained and together they published manifesto in Regeneration addressed to anarchists of the world. In 1918 they were arrested accused of conspiracy by the United States government and sentenced to 15 and 20 years in prison respectively. Flores Magón died in prison in 1922. Rivera was released and deported to Mexico where he continued denouncing the governments emanating from the revolution he was imprisoned during the mandate of Plutarco Elías Calles and died in 1932. Legacy The PLM slogan Tierra Libertad Land and Liberty also appeared in the group 's Regeneración newspaper illustrations. Ricardo Flores Magón used it as the title of play and William C. Owen used it as the title of an American anarchist newspaper. See also Liberalism in Mexico References Further reading.

Recording and release On April 11 2012 Green Day announced that they would be releasing trilogy of albums titled ¡Uno ¡Dos and ¡Tré. and stated that they would be released on September 25 2012 November 13 2012 and January 15 2013 respectively through Reprise Records. On August 22 Armstrong gave preview of some songs through his iPhone on Zane Lowe 's show on BBC Radio in the UK. The preview included brief snippet of 8th Ave Serenade. The track listing for ¡Tré. was revealed at the beginning of their video for the promotional single Nuclear Family from ¡Uno. It was later released officially on the Idiot Club and was later posted on their website.

On October 29 it was announced that the album 's release will be pushed forward to December 11 2012 due to Green Day having to cancel their upcoming 2012 section of their 2012/2013 tour and delay much of the 2013 leg. On November Green Day released Behind The Scenes of ¡Uno ¡Dos and ¡Tré. Part which featured the preview of the song X-Kid. The release date of the ¡Tré. LPs were pushed back to February 12 2013 presumably to correct the erroneous inclusion of Stray Heart on initial pressings of the album replacing the track with Drama Queen as present on CD and digital releases of the album. Previews of Missing You and Dirty Rotten Bastards were featured on Green Day 's ¡Cuatro. documentary. Singles The band released video of cassette tape playing for the song X-Kid and later confirmed it as the first single released on February 12 2013. Music and composition Billie Joe Armstrong had said the following about the trilogy Each of the three albums has totally different vibe. The first one is power pop.

On October 29 it was announced that the album 's release will be pushed forward to December 11 2012 due to Green Day having to cancel their upcoming 2012 section of their 2012/2013 tour and delay much of the 2013 leg. On November Green Day released Behind The Scenes of ¡Uno ¡Dos and ¡Tré. Part which featured the preview of the song X-Kid. The release date of the ¡Tré.

Tuu languages,The Tuu languages or Taa–ǃKwi Taa–ǃUi ǃUi–Taa Kwi languages are language family consisting of two language clusters spoken in Botswana and South Africa. The relationship between the two clusters is not doubted but is distant. The name Tuu comes from word common to both branches of the family for person.,"The Tuu languages or Taa–ǃKwi Taa–ǃUi ǃUi–Taa Kwi languages are language family consisting of two language clusters spoken in Botswana and South Africa. The relationship between the two clusters is not doubted but is distant. The name Tuu comes from word common to both branches of the family for person. History The ancestor of Tuu languages Proto-Tuu was presumably also spoken in or around the Kalahari desert as word for the gemsbok hai is reconstructable to Proto-Tuu.There is evidence of substantial borrowing of words between Tuu languages and other Khoisan languages including basic vocabulary. Khoekhoe in particular is thought to have Tuu Ui branch substrate.Examples of borrowings from Khoe into Tuu include 'chest ǃXóõ gǁúu from Khoe gǁuu and 'chin Nǁng gǃann from Khoe ǃann. root for 'louse shared by some Khoe and Tuu languages ǁxóni~kx'uni~kx'uri has been suggested as deriving from 'pre-Tuu/pre-Khoe substrate. Classification The Tuu languages are not demonstrably related to any other language family though they do share many similarities to the languages of the Kxʼa family. This is generally thought to be due to thousands of years of contact and mutual influence sprachbund but some scholars believe that the two families may eventually prove not to be orphans. The Tuu languages were once thought to form branch of the now-obsolete Khoisan language family and were thus called Southern Khoisan. Languages Taa ǃXóõ dialect cluster Lower Nossob two dialects ǀʼAuni and Kuǀhaasi ǃKwi ǃUi Nǁng dialect cluster moribund ǀXam dialect cluster including Nǀuusaa ǂUngkue ǁXegwi ǃGãǃne †The ǃKwi ǃUi branch of South Africa is moribund with only one language extant Nǁng and that with fewer than elderly speakers. ǃKwi languages were once widespread across South Africa the most famous ǀXam was the source of the modern national motto of that nation ǃke eː ǀxarra ǁke. The Taa branch of Botswana is more robust though it also has only one surviving language ǃXóõ with 2,500 speakers. Because many of the Tuu languages became extinct with little record there is considerable confusion as to which of their many names represented separate languages or even dialects. The list of Khoisan languages has some possibilities. There were presumably additional Tuu languages. Westphal studied Taa variety variously rendered ǀŋamani ǀnamani Ngǀamani ǀŋamasa. It is apparently now extinct. Bleek recorded another now-extinct variety which she labeled 'S5 in the town of Khakhea it is known in the literature as Kakia. Another in the Nossop area labeled 'S4a is known as Xaitia Khatia Katia Kattea. Vaalpens ǀKusi and ǀEikusi evidently refer to the same variety as Xatia. Westphal 1971 lists them both as Nǀamani dialects though Köhler lists only Khatia and classifies it as ǃKwi. The Tuu languages along with neighboring ǂʼAmkoe are known for being the only languages in the world to have bilabial clicks as distinctive speech sounds apart from the extinct ritual jargon Damin of northern Australia which was not mother tongue. Taa ǂʼAmkoe and neighboring Gǀui of the Khoe family form sprachbund language bond with some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. All languages in these three families also have tone. References Sources Güldemann Tom. 2006. The San languages of southern Namibia Linguistic appraisal with special reference to J. G.

Background and recording In February 2012 Billie Joe Armstrong announced that the band was in the studio recording material for new album. In the statement he said We are at the most prolific and creative time in our lives .... This is the best music we 've ever written and the songs just keep coming. Instead of making one album we are making three album trilogy. Every song has the power and energy that represents Green Day on all emotional levels. We just ca n't help ourselves ... We are going epic as fuck. The band started work by rehearsing every other day and making songs. They recorded the album at Jingletown Studios in Oakland California. The band recorded 37 songs and initially thought of making double album. Armstrong suggested making trilogy of albums like Van Halen 's Van Halen Van Halen II and Van Halen III. He stated in an interview The songs just kept coming kept coming. 'd go Maybe double album. No that 's too much nowadays. Then more songs kept coming. And one day sprung it on the others 'Instead of Van Halen II and III what if it 's Green Day II and III and we all have our faces on each cover. Writing and composition In an interview to Rolling Stone Armstrong stated that the theme of ¡Uno. would be different from that of 21st Century Breakdown and American Idiot and would not be third rock opera. He added that music on the record would be punchier more power pop somewhere between AC/DC and the early Beatles than the band 's previous albums. He also stated that few songs on the album would also sound like garage rock and dance music. According to Armstrong the song Kill the DJ was straight-up dance music and four-on-the-floor rhythm which the band has never done before.According to music critic David Fricke ¡Uno. is power pop album less polemic and conceptual than American Idiot or 21st Century Breakdown and Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that its music is exclusively power pop and three-chord rock songs. It was also characterized as pop punk by Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald and Robert Cooke of The Fly while Scott Heisel of the Alternative Press said that ¡Uno. is punk rock album. Annie Zaleski of Las Vegas Weekly labeled it as both pop-punk and pop record. Release and promotion In April 2012 Green Day announced through press release it would be releasing trilogy of albums titled ¡Uno ¡Dos and ¡Tré. and stated that they would be released on September 25 2012 November 13 2012 and January 15 2013 later moved up to December 11 2012 respectively through Reprise Records. ¡Uno the first album from the trilogy was released on September 24 2012 in the United Kingdom and on September 25 in the United States.

Critical reception ¡Uno. received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics. At Metacritic which assigns normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics the album received an average score of 67 based on 32 reviews. In his review for Rolling Stone David Fricke complimented the album 's 12 blasts of hook-savvy mosh-pit pop and found it to be plain relief after the weight and worry of the band 's previous two albums observing hipper richer grip in the details. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly called the album welcome switch from high concept to high energy. Kerrang. magazine called it sharp and often exhilarating change of gear from the Green Day of the past eight years. BBC Music 's Ian Winwood called it work of masterfully controlled music. Mojo recommended it to fans of the band 's 1994 album Dookie and stated your favourite slacker-punks are briefly back. Scott Heisel of Alternative Press praised its loud fast catchy-as-fuck punk rock and wrote that its stripped down instrumentation and more direct lyrics are mutually beneficial. Jason Heller of The A.V. Club commented that filler abounds and it doesn land with quite as much delirious abandon as it once did but Armstrong power-pop impulse can still pack face-splitting punch. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine felt that its big crisp and clean sound undercuts some of the punkiness of Green Day 's intentions but complimented their attack as precise and wrote that the huge hooks gleefully bludgeon doubters into blissful submission. In mixed review Ed Power of Hot Press observed over-familiarity and less to say on Uno than on the band 's previous work stating they are doing what they do best. Nothing less but certainly nothing more. Dave Simpson of The Guardian called ¡Uno. very decent fist of sounding like their twentysomething selves but wrote that the pace does n't vary and the recent social commentary ... has given way to more teenage concerns. Slant Magazine 's Yorgo Douramacos called the album fairly strong but felt that the songs sound like only slightly altered versions of previous entries in the Green Day catalogue. In negative review Andy Gill of The Independent panned Green Day 's devotion to the most basic of rock formats and called the music patronising corporate rock masquerading in sweary adolescent anthems as somehow anti-establishment. Randall Roberts of the Los Angeles Times asserted that the album was too typical and commercial to be punk album writing that it feels like the work of band that has painted itself into an aesthetic corner. Paul Mardles of The Observer criticized the album as largely throwaway its frenzied phlegm-flecked songs littered with sentiments ... that sound daft coming from 40-year-old frontman. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune was ambivalent towards its back-to-basics approach and perceived lack of memorable lyric. Barry Nicolson of NME found the album more comparable to the three albums that followed Dookie noting highs that prove unsustainable and lows that hope you 're too adrenalised to notice. Rolling Stone ranked it number eight on their year-end top albums list for 2012. Robert Christgau later said in 2021 that the album had sounded like more of the self-important same and diminished his interest in the band 's subsequent work. Commercial performance The album debuted at number two on the US Billboard 200 chart selling 139,000 copies in its first week. After months Uno had shifted 256,000 copies in the US. The album has sold over 325,000 copies in the US. In the United Kingdom it also debuted at number two on the UK Albums Chart on first-week sales of 42,651 copies.

The movie is thought to have been the first Mexican super-production and led to the bankruptcy of the film company that made it.,Let 's Go with Pancho Villa Spanish Vámonos con Pancho Villa is Mexican motion picture directed by Fernando de Fuentes in 1936 the last of the director 's Revolution Trilogy besides El prisionero trece and El compadre Mendoza. An anti-epic based on novel it focuses on the cruelty of the Mexican Revolution and Pancho Villa himself contrary to most of the Mexican movies about this national hero. The movie is thought to have been the first Mexican super-production and led to the bankruptcy of the film company that made it. Plot Villa was portrayed by Domingo Soler. Directed by Fernando de Fuentes the film tells the story of group of friends who hear about the revolution and Villa and decide to join him only to suffer the cruel reality of war under the command of Villa who simply does not care about his men. The movie has two endings the original ending shows the last surviving friend returning to his home disenchanted with both Villa and the Revolution. The second ending discovered many years later returns to the same scene ten years later when an old and weakened Villa tries to recruit the last survivor again when the father hesitates as he does not want to leave his wife and daughter behind Villa kills the wife and daughter. The angry father then tries to kill Villa before another man shoots the father dead. Villa takes the sole survivor the son with him. Background great failure when released interest in the movie resurged many decades later and today is considered one of the best movies of Mexican cinema both for its approach to the theme and its technical merits. It stands apart among the many movies made about Villa in that it portrays the man and the Revolution in its cruelty most other films like those by Ismael Rodríguez in the 1960s take an almost idyllic view of both following the official government mythos. The movie music was composed by Silvestre Revueltas who makes cameo appearance. See also Cinema of Mexico External links Movie review in Spanish. Let 's Go with Pancho Villa at IMDb.

¡Viva! Vaughan,¡Viva. Vaughan is 1965 studio album by Sarah Vaughan orchestrated and conducted by Frank Foster and produced by Quincy Jones.,¡Viva. Vaughan is 1965 studio album by Sarah Vaughan orchestrated and conducted by Frank Foster and produced by Quincy Jones. Reception The Allmusic review by Ken Dryden awarded ¡Viva. Vaughan three and half stars and said Vaughan is in great voice throughout the date and the material is generally first-rate except for the bland Night Song ... Unfortunately the bossa nova selections The Boy From Ipanema and Quiet Nights are burdened with pedestrian string arrangements that date the music as much as the generally uninspired Latin percussion. It 's likely that this lack of focus confused the record-buying public as to what type of music this was and caused it to be overlooked.

It was produced by Fall Out Boy 's Patrick Stump whose vocals also feature throughout the album. The album peaked at No. 80 on Billboard 200. It has sold more than 40,000 copies to date. Background Cobra Starship was formed in 2005 after Midtown bassist Gabe Saporta took trip to the deserts of Arizona. During this time Saporta went on vision quest spending time with Native American tribes and smoking peyote. He began to create his vision for new band melodic style of music heavily influenced by synthpop and hip-hop. Upon returning home Saporta rented house in the Catskill Mountains and began writing what would become the band 's debut album While the City Sleeps We Rule the Streets. He posted parody response to Gwen Stefani 's Hollaback Girl titled Hollaback Boy on Myspace. The song gained Saporta notoriety on the internet and he eventually signed to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz 's label Decaydance Records.Midtown 's management company soon set Saporta up with an opportunity to record song for the soundtrack to the 2006 Snakes on Plane. Along with members of The Academy Is ... Gym Class Heroes and The Sounds Saporta recorded Snakes on Plane Bring It which became minor hit. During the recording of While the City Sleeps We Rule the Streets Saporta began recruiting new members to complete the group 's lineup. He first enlisted drummer Nate Navarro whom he met on tour while Navarro sold merchandise for fellow touring act Hidden In Plain View. After seeing Saporta in Entertainment Weekly guitarist Ryland Blackinton and bassist Alex Suarez who lived in the same apartment building as Midtown drummer Rob Hitt emailed Saporta asking to join the group. The lineup was completed by keytarist Elisa Schwartz who was later replaced by Victoria Asher in December 2006. Recording and production While on the 2007 Honda Civic Tour the group began writing music together. The members recorded their individual parts on their laptops in the band 's bus. By the time Cobra Starship entered the studio to work on new album much of the material was already written. The album was recorded in twenty days at Mission Sound Studios in Brooklyn New York. Composition Music The album has been described as 11 tracks of unabashed party jams full of big hooky electropop super-produced guitar crunch and the occasional T-Pain-style vocoder thrown in for good measure. Smile for the Paparazzi contains Latin influences and introduces touch of Spanish heat to thoroughly Americanized album .Philadelphia-based gay hip-hop trio V.I.P appears on Damn You Look Good and 'm Drunk Scandalous. Blackinton commented on the collaboration stating V.I.P. are the best. Seriously. They 're these dudes from Philly ... and they write hard-core gay rap songs. And we had 'Scandalous and we thought it would be good idea to have them come in and just offer their vocal talents. It was probably the most awesome thing we 've ever done. Lyrics The majority of the lyrics on ¡Viva la Cobra. are inspired by Cobra Starship 's rise to fame. Saporta explained All of us played in punk-rock bands growing up and we could never have dreamed of having this level of celebrity ... On one hand it 's awesome because you 're hanging out with all your friends you 're getting the VIP treatment. But then you also see how it 's just like this big flattery convention. And the record is sort of about that contradiction where on one hand you wan na have fun and party but at the same time it 's critique of that whole lifestyle. Damn You Look Good and 'm Drunk Scandalous which was originally titled Fake Boobs and Rollerblades discusses trashy women who the band often met at parties. Title Through the Fueled by Ramen street team the band allowed members of the street team to choose between two possible song titles for five different songs on the record. The album was originally going to be called If the World Is Ending We 're Throwing the Party however singer Gabe Saporta stated that We all LOVED the title If the World Is Ending We 're Throwing the Party it 's actually line from what think will be the first song we put out Guilty Pleasure. But everyone was having hard time remembering it they were like what is it again. If the world is gon na end then we 're gon na. etc. And we were on tour in Europe with like days left to decide on title. We had an overnight flight from Singapore with Gym Class Heroes and The Academy Is ... where we did n't sleep and were deliriously coming up with whole bunch of titles some of the top runners Shred Savage Cobra Lingus Sass Attack Holiday in Cambrodia Bromeo and Juliet you get the idea .. Then we get to Africa for Decaydance Fest and me Pete and Patrick are backstage struggling and brain-storming to try to find something that can work. And in pops Travis distracting everyone and talking million miles minute about some shit about Lil Wayne rapping with GCH and putting in Viva La White Girl at the front of Clothes Off. And was like oh shit. How about Viva La Cobra. Travis gave me this come-on-are-you-serious. look. But everyone loved it. And since we 're like family he had to let me do it so it 's all good. But Travis said got ta pay him 75 bucks. Critical reception Critical response to ¡Viva la Cobra. was generally mixed to positive. Luke O'Neil of Alternative Press enjoyed the disc 's party-at-the-end-of-the-world style and stated that Contemporary emo-pop sensibilities meet 80s party abandon on this record and neither have sounded so enjoyable in years. Mikael Wood of Entertainment Weekly gave the album grade and concluded that the album improved upon its predecessor with catchier hooks and harder-rocking beats. Jon Young of Spin praised Viva la Cobra 's catchy nature but felt that the album suffered from over-production explaining Sadly the glitzy overkill production by Fall Out Boy 's Patrick Stump nearly obliterates any potential dance-rock charm. Despite killer hooks 'Guilty Pleasure and 'The City Is at War leave an artificial aftertaste. Andrew Leahey of Allmusic opined that the album was overly repetitive commenting There 's enough melody here to satisfy most lingering fans ... But even Stump ca n't give the band another sure-fire hit as all the dance-pop numbers end up repeating the same steps in an attempt to perfect the one routine Cobra Starship knows how to do.

An open casting call in the summer after the album was released was advertised for filming of the new video. The go-kart racing portions were filmed in Amesbury Massachusetts. Rumor has it that the video for Combustible had to be redesigned in the wake of the September 11th 2001 terrorist attacks since video showing things blowing up was deemed not to be in the band 's best interests.

Otherwise known as The Children of Wowow they are group of artists fashion designers writers and musicians who have promoted numerous art events and parties in London and Berlin. History Wowow. began in the back of the Joiners Arms in Camberwell in 2003 as performance night in pub by Hanna Hanra and Matthew Stone. In 2004 the collective squatted large Victorian co-op in Peckham South East London and made it into an artist-run space. They include fashion designer Gareth Pugh performance artist Millie Brown video installation artist Adham Faramawy James Balmforth and artist Matthew Stone. Other artists to have shown in the space include Boo Saville Gareth Cadwallader Florence The Machine 's Isabella Summers and Ellie Tobin.In 2003 Wowow. organised warehouse parties in Peckham. At times club nights with 2000 people took place. One of these was attended by Lauren Bush the former U.S. President 's niece and her two CIA bodyguards.The second show by the collective in December 2004 was of paintings film photography and performance by recent Slade graduates for month in the Georgian building at 251 Rye Lane Peckham formerly occupied by the Co-op shop which the artists gutted and refurbished. The artists who curated the exhibition together included Chloe Dewe Mathews with photographs of lidos Matthew Stone with digital recreations of old paintings Rachael Haines with surrealist inspired collages and Boo Saville with monkey paintings and biro drawings. The opening featured shamanistic chanting shopping Trolley Mardi Gras live bands and recreation of Michael Jackson 's video Thriller by performance artist Lali Chetwynd 's troupe.In November 2005 the Children of Wowow. organised week-long event in large warehouse in Peckham curated by member Gareth Cadwallader and in number of smaller venues in the area featuring members of the collective and also Mark McGowan. Events included Stolen Cinema with cult films from local rental shop Richard Elms play Factory Dog and Greasy Spoon Art Salon Breakfast presided over by Lali Chetwynd and Zoe Brown. he week culminated with party for 1,500 people with 10,000 bottles of beer 500 bottles of whiskey and 13 live bands on stage. The bands included The So Silage Crew Ludes The Long Blondes and Ivich Lives.The Amazing squat created its own distinctly odd harlequin-esque fashion style through Gareth Pughs participation. Hanna Hanra and Katie Shillingford edited Fashion/ Art/ Leisure fanzine affiliated with the group.Matthew Stone said It was an opportunity to invest in what we believed in rather than chipping off bits of our soul working as unpaid interns. The practicalities of not having to work meant that we could be playful with what we did but some serious ideas came out of that ridiculous house. Since the Imperials left their original building in 2006 they have organised events in Dresden and also squatted Kwik Fit Garage in Camberwell for an exhibition. Millie Brown and Adham Faramawy have organised several art and music events. These have included an event in March 2007 in Birmingham.

!Women Art Revolution,Women Art Revolution is 2010 documentary film directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson and distributed by Zeitgeist Films. It tracks the feminist art movement over 40 years through interviews with artists curators critics and historians.,"Women Art Revolution is 2010 documentary film directed by Lynn Hershman Leeson and distributed by Zeitgeist Films. It tracks the feminist art movement over 40 years through interviews with artists curators critics and historians. Synopsis Women Art Revolution is documentary film created by Lynn Hershman Leeson to examine the under-recognized world of feminist art. Through interviews documentary footage and artworks the film tracks the trajectory of feminist art. It begins at the start of the 1960s with antiwar and civil rights protests it follows developments in feminist art through the 1970s. Lynn Hershman Lesson interviewed artists curators critics and historians for over decades about their individual and group efforts to help women succeed in the art world and society by helping them overcome obstacles. There were over 40 individuals interviewed for the project. These interviews are done in variety of places over time. The interviewees talk about their experiences in the art world facing obstacles because of their gender. Many of the artists discuss the works they made as result. The movie begins with scene at the Whitney Museum of American Art where Hershman asks people to name women artists very few can name more than Frida Kahlo. Hershman calls the film the remains of an insistent history that refuses to wait any longer to be told. She says the events of the day led her to feel an urgency to capture that moment and shoot whenever wherever with borrowed camera. The film gets its name from Women Artists in Revolution WAR which formed in the 1960s as coalition to raise awareness about the unique obstacles faced by female artists. Many of the issues started at fundamental level Rachel Rosenthal states in the movie with the women artists not getting recognition in the study of art history and books. The interviewees all talk about how male-dominated the art world was sharing their personal stories. The work these feminist artists were creating at the time were very different from works shown or talked about at the time. The film overlays historical events with feminist art events which were somewhat spurred on by these political events such as the Vietnam War Black Panthers Civil Rights Movement Women 's Liberation and Free Speech Movement. She labels the 1968 Miss America Pageant as the moment when art and politics fused culminating in weeklong protest of art events. The film mentions that minimalism was the popular art style of the time. Meant to be devoid of politics this movement did n't match up with what was happening socially and politically. The feminist art movement worked to recognize contemporary political movements and social issues creating platform for awareness of these events. Cast Awards 2010 Official Selection at Toronto International Film Festival 2011 Official Selection at Sundance Film Festival New Frontier 2011 Official Selection at Berlin International Film Festival Release The film debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival TIFF 2010 as part of the Real to Reel category. Women Art Revolution played at New York 's IFC Center beginning June 2011 before opening around the country. Digital archive In the film Hershman states that the filming process has accumulated roughly 12,428 minutes of footage and W.A.R. shows only 83 minutes leaving 12,343 minutes of footage out. digital archive was created to contain the two decades of Hershmann Leeson 's interviews that went into creating this film and is available through the Stanford University Libraries collection W.A.R. Voices of Movement. According to the collection website Hershmann Leeson desired this repository to be shared with as wide an audience as possible. Reception Barry Keith Grant praises the film in his Film International piece Leeson 's film is like patchwork quilt of disparate footage but in the end it all comes together to become an important feminist work. The film could well serve as required viewing for art and film students today. Reviewer Ellen Druda says This powerful film will ignite even the tiniest spark of feminism in any woman 's heart. Not only art lovers will come away with deeper understanding of the movement and an appreciation for those who stood up and paved the way. Richard Knight for the Windy City Times has more critical view of the film explaining Hershman Leeson succeeds in her goal to expose and pique the interest of the viewer to the radical feminist artists who used activist tactics to get their work shown demanding parity with their male counterparts. However by the time queer film historian B. Ruby Rich starts talking about how the lesbian artists did n't want to identify as artists because that label was considered bourgeois by their female counterparts the movie has taken on an exclusionary air of its own just like those 'womyn only coffeehouses that existed 'back in the day. So while the film undercuts some of its own arguments by veering too strongly into the very separatist direction it decries and annoyingly overlooks the artist 's feminist forebears like O'Keeffe Nevelson and Kahlo for example Women Art Revolution does offer plenty of food for thought for everyone. Elisabeth Subrin states that Fusing history with memoir Lynn Hershman Leeson enlists multiple visual strategies to produce an elegantly layered visual and sonic web of politics and powerful emotion.

Other artists to have shown in the space include Boo Saville Gareth Cadwallader Florence The Machine 's Isabella Summers and Ellie Tobin.In 2003 Wowow. organised warehouse parties in Peckham. At times club nights with 2000 people took place. One of these was attended by Lauren Bush the former U.S. President 's niece and her two CIA bodyguards.The second show by the collective in December 2004 was of paintings film photography and performance by recent Slade graduates for month in the Georgian building at 251 Rye Lane Peckham formerly occupied by the Co-op shop which the artists gutted and refurbished. The artists who curated the exhibition together included Chloe Dewe Mathews with photographs of lidos Matthew Stone with digital recreations of old paintings Rachael Haines with surrealist inspired collages and Boo Saville with monkey paintings and biro drawings. The opening featured shamanistic chanting shopping Trolley Mardi Gras live bands and recreation of Michael Jackson 's video Thriller by performance artist Lali Chetwynd 's troupe.In November 2005 the Children of Wowow. organised week-long event in large warehouse in Peckham curated by member Gareth Cadwallader and in number of smaller venues in the area featuring members of the collective and also Mark McGowan. Events included Stolen Cinema with cult films from local rental shop Richard Elms play Factory Dog and Greasy Spoon Art Salon Breakfast presided over by Lali Chetwynd and Zoe Brown. he week culminated with party for 1,500 people with 10,000 bottles of beer 500 bottles of whiskey and 13 live bands on stage. The bands included The So Silage Crew Ludes The Long Blondes and Ivich Lives.The Amazing squat created its own distinctly odd harlequin-esque fashion style through Gareth Pughs participation. Hanna Hanra and Katie Shillingford edited Fashion/ Art/ Leisure fanzine affiliated with the group.Matthew Stone said It was an opportunity to invest in what we believed in rather than chipping off bits of our soul working as unpaid interns. The practicalities of not having to work meant that we could be playful with what we did but some serious ideas came out of that ridiculous house. Since the Imperials left their original building in 2006 they have organised events in Dresden and also squatted Kwik Fit Garage in Camberwell for an exhibition. Millie Brown and Adham Faramawy have organised several art and music events. These have included an event in March 2007 in Birmingham. Along with the original group several other artists and performers exhibited including Theo Adams Ben Schumacher Lennie Lee and Fayann Smith.

ǀXam and ǂKhomani heartland,The ǀXam and ǂKhomani heartland tentative World Heritage Site consists of regions located to the South and North of Upington respectively in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa. The ǀXam and ǂKhomani more correctly Nǁnǂe people were linguistically related groups of San Bushman people their respective languages ǀXam and ǂKhomani being part of the ǃKwi language group. Descendants of both the ǀXam and Nǁnǂe include Afrikaans-speaking Coloured people on farms or in towns in the region amongst whom the precolonial languages are either entirely extinct in the case of ǀXam or can be spoken by but very few people in the case of Nǁnǂe.,The ǀXam and ǂKhomani heartland tentative World Heritage Site consists of regions located to the South and North of Upington respectively in the Northern Cape Province of South Africa.

Site description The two areas consist of semi-arid to arid tracts of the Upper Karoo to the south and the Southern Kalahari to the north. Both areas are rich in archaeological traces inter alia of the Later Stone Age while rocky hills and outcrops in the southern area which has been referred to as ǀXam-ka ǃxau meaning home of the ǀXam have wealth of rock art sites preponderantly in the form of rock engravings. In the ǂKhomani area to the north where the sandy desert topography precludes rock art cultural mapping project contributes to revival of interest in cultural traditions in the younger generation. History With the official proclamation of the Kalahari Gemsbok National Park in 1931 the majority of the Khomani as well as the Mier people who lived in that area were forced to move to other areas. World Heritage Status The ǀXam and ǂKhomani heartland site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on May 15 2004 in the Cultural category.The northern component the ǂKhomani Cultural Landscape was inscribed on the World Heritage list on July 2017 during the 41st session of the United Nations Education Scientific and Cultural Organisation UNESCO World Heritage Committee which took place in Kraków Poland 2–12 July 2017.

Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Taa language,Taa also known as ǃXóõ also spelled ǃKhong and ǃXoon Taa pronunciation ǃ͡χɔ̃ː˦ is Tuu language notable for its large number of phonemes perhaps the largest in the world.

Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/.

However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana.

This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

ǃKung languages,ǃKung ǃXun also known as Ju is dialect continuum language complex spoken in Namibia Botswana and Angola by the ǃKung people constituting two or three languages. Together with the ǂʼAmkoe language ǃKung forms the Kxʼa language family. ǃKung constituted one of the branches of the putative Khoisan language family and was called Northern Khoisan in that scenario but the unity of Khoisan has never been demonstrated and is now regarded as spurious. Nonetheless the anthropological term Khoisan has been retained as an umbrella term for click languages in general.ǃKung is famous for its many clicks such as the in its name and has some of the most complex inventories of both consonants and vowels in the world. It also has tone and nasalization. For description see Juǀʼhoan.

Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine Honken 2010 Heine Honken 2010 classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider single language Northern–Western ǃXunNorthern ǃXun N1 Maligo ǃxuun kúándò ǃxuun Kwando ǃXuun SE Angola N2 ǃʼOǃKung ǃʼo ǃuŋ Forest ǃXuun eastern Angola Western ǃXun W1 ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun Eenhana district Namibia W2 ǀʼAkhwe ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun Eenhana Namibia W3 Tsintsabis ǃxūún Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia Kavango ǃXuun ǃxūún known as dom ǃxūún River ǃXuun in Ekoka Western Rundu district Namibia Angola adjacent Central ǃXun C1 Gaub Tsumeb district Namibia C2 Neitsas Grootfontein district Namibia tentatively also the Tsintsabis Leeunes and Mangetti different from Mangetti Dune dialectsSoutheastern ǃXun E1 Juǀʼhoan ju-ǀʼhoan -si Tsumkwe district Namibia Bots adjacent E2 Dikundu ǃxun ju-ǀʼhoa si Dikundu Caprivi E3 ǂKxʼauǁʼein ju-ǀʼhoan -si ǃxun ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn Northern people Gobabis district Namibia Heine König 2015 p. 324 state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects understand one another to quite some extent but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine Honken 2010 Heine Honken 2010 classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider single language Northern–Western ǃXunNorthern ǃXun N1 Maligo ǃxuun kúándò ǃxuun Kwando ǃXuun SE Angola N2 ǃʼOǃKung ǃʼo ǃuŋ Forest ǃXuun eastern Angola Western ǃXun W1 ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun Eenhana district Namibia W2 ǀʼAkhwe ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun Eenhana Namibia W3 Tsintsabis ǃxūún Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia Kavango ǃXuun ǃxūún known as dom ǃxūún River ǃXuun in Ekoka Western Rundu district Namibia Angola adjacent Central ǃXun C1 Gaub Tsumeb district Namibia C2 Neitsas Grootfontein district Namibia tentatively also the Tsintsabis Leeunes and Mangetti different from Mangetti Dune dialectsSoutheastern ǃXun E1 Juǀʼhoan ju-ǀʼhoan -si Tsumkwe district Namibia Bots adjacent E2 Dikundu ǃxun ju-ǀʼhoa si Dikundu Caprivi E3 ǂKxʼauǁʼein ju-ǀʼhoan -si ǃxun ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn Northern people Gobabis district Namibia Heine König 2015 p. 324 state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects understand one another to quite some extent but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975.

Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length.

To pronounce ǃXuun pronounced ǃ͡χũː˦˥ in Western ǃKung/ǃXuun one makes click sound before the sound which is like Scottish or German ch followed by long nasal vowel with high rising tone. Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine Honken 2010 Heine Honken 2010 classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider single language Northern–Western ǃXunNorthern ǃXun N1 Maligo ǃxuun kúándò ǃxuun Kwando ǃXuun SE Angola N2 ǃʼOǃKung ǃʼo ǃuŋ Forest ǃXuun eastern Angola Western ǃXun W1 ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun Eenhana district Namibia W2 ǀʼAkhwe ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun Eenhana Namibia W3 Tsintsabis ǃxūún Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia Kavango ǃXuun ǃxūún known as dom ǃxūún River ǃXuun in Ekoka Western Rundu district Namibia Angola adjacent Central ǃXun C1 Gaub Tsumeb district Namibia C2 Neitsas Grootfontein district Namibia tentatively also the Tsintsabis Leeunes and Mangetti different from Mangetti Dune dialectsSoutheastern ǃXun E1 Juǀʼhoan ju-ǀʼhoan -si Tsumkwe district Namibia Bots adjacent E2 Dikundu ǃxun ju-ǀʼhoa si Dikundu Caprivi E3 ǂKxʼauǁʼein ju-ǀʼhoan -si ǃxun ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn Northern people Gobabis district Namibia Heine König 2015 p. 324 state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects understand one another to quite some extent but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

It has been adopted by several Latin American insurgent groups as an expression of affront towards issues that sparked the original dissent. Its adoption by the EZLN in Mexico as the movement 's motto is exemplary of its popularity and ability to rally diverse ideologies under common goal. Linguistics and etymology Grammatically there is little difference between ¡Basta ya. and ¡Ya basta and both are correct. The phrase or its Italian equivalent may be the source of the English nautical word Avast which means Stop cease or desist from whatever is being done. Examples of usage According to Thomas Oleson there is different website from the Ya Basta. Italian solidarity group. Ya Basta which Justin Paulson launched in March 1994 was one of the first websites to feature EZLN content. Ya Basta Association was the name of major anti-capitalist activist network of groups in Italy which played central role in the Anti-G8 protest in 2001. They are known for their adoption of sophisticated direct action tactics and for making suits of armor out of street garbage and recycled materials. Ya Basta Association is sometimes associated with the White Overalls who appear in many protests heavily padded.Another movement with similar name is Spanish ¡Basta Ya an organization opposing the former Basque separatist organization ETA which carried out attacks in the Basque Country to demand its independence from Spain and France.Rapper M-1 of the group Dead Prez endorsed the use of the phrase and the accompanying hand sign in the film Dave Chappelle 's Block Party. The phrase is the name of French record label and has been used as the title of works by various musicians including Sonic Boom Six GrimSkunk Elida Reyna and Ultra-red. References See also.
CONFIG.SYS,CONFIG.SYS is the primary configuration file for the DOS and OS/2 operating systems. It is special ASCII text file that contains user-accessible setup or configuration directives evaluated by the operating system 's DOS BIOS typically residing in IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS during boot. CONFIG.SYS was introduced with DOS 2.0.,CONFIG.SYS is the primary configuration file for the DOS and OS/2 operating systems. It is special ASCII text file that contains user-accessible setup or configuration directives evaluated by the operating system 's DOS BIOS typically residing in IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS during boot. CONFIG.SYS was introduced with DOS 2.0. Usage The directives in this file configure DOS for use with devices and applications in the system. The CONFIG.SYS directives also set up the memory managers in the system. After processing the CONFIG.SYS file DOS proceeds to load and execute the command shell specified in the SHELL line of CONFIG.SYS or COMMAND.COM if there is no such line. The command shell in turn is responsible for processing the AUTOEXEC.BAT file. CONFIG.SYS is composed mostly of name=value directives which look like variable assignments. In fact these will either define some tunable parameters often resulting in reservation of memory or load files mostly device drivers and terminate-and-stay-resident programs TSRs into memory. In DOS CONFIG.SYS is located in the root directory of the drive from which the system was booted. The filename is also used by Disk Control Program DCP an MS-DOS derivative by the former East-German VEB Robotron.Some versions of DOS will probe for alternative filenames taking precedence over the default CONFIG.SYS filename if they exist While older versions of Concurrent DOS 3.2 to 4.1 did not support CONFIG.SYS files at all later versions of Concurrent DOS 386 and Concurrent DOS XM as well as Multiuser DOS System Manager and REAL/32 will probe for CCONFIG.SYS with derived from Concurrent instead of CONFIG.SYS. Some versions of Multiuser DOS use filename of CCONFIG.INI instead whereas REAL/32 is known to look for MCONFIG.SYS. These operating systems support many additional and different configuration settings like INIT_INSTALL not known under MS-DOS/PC DOS but they are stored in the binary repository named CCONFIG.BIN rather than in CCONFIG.INI. Both files are typically modified through configuration utility named CONFIG.EXE only.Under DR DOS 3.31 PalmDOS 1.0 Novell DOS OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher file named DCONFIG.SYS with derived from DR DOS if present will take precedence over CONFIG.SYS. Since DR DOS 6.0 this was used in conjunction with disk compression software where the original boot drive would become drive after loading the compression driver and the in the file name came in handy as well but it is commonly used to help maintain multiple configuration files in multi-boot scenarios. In addition to this OpenDOS 7.01 and DR-OpenDOS 7.02 will look for file named ODCONFIG.SYS whereas some issues of DR-DOS 7.02 and higher will instead also look for DRCONFIG.SYS. Further under DR DOS 6.0 and higher the SYS /DR ext command can be used to change the default file extensions. For example with SYS /L /DR:703 the written Volume Boot Record would look for renamed and modified IBMBIO.703 system file instead of the default IBMBIO.COM and the IBMBIO.703 would look for IBMDOS.703 and CONFIG.703 instead of IBMDOS.COM and CONFIG.SYS so that multiple parallel sets of files can coexist in the same root directory and be selected via boot-loader like LOADER supplied with Multiuser DOS and DR-DOS 7.02/7.03. The SHELL directive is enhanced to provide means to specify alternative AUTOEXEC.BAT files via /P filename.ext and in this specific scenario COMMAND.COM will accept file extensions other than .BAT as well both features are also supported by 4DOS. Under DR DOS 6.0 and higher the CONFIG.SYS directive CHAIN=filespec can be used to continue processing in the named file which does not necessarily need to reside in the root directory of the boot drive. DR-DOS 7.02 and higher optionally support an additional parameter as in CHAIN=filespec label to jump to specific label in the given file. DR-DOS 7.03 and higher support new SYS /A parameter in order to copy the corresponding CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT files along with the system files.FreeDOS implements similar feature with its FDCONFIG.SYS configuration file. RxDOS 7.24 and higher use RXCONFIG.SYS instead. PTS-DOS uses CONFIG.PTS. Both CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT can be found included in the root folder of Windows 95 and Windows 98 boot drives as they are based on DOS. Typically these files are left empty with no content. Windows ME does not even parse the CONFIG.SYS file during the Windows boot process loading environment variables from the Windows Registry instead HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SessionManager\EnvironmentUnder FlexOS CONFIG.SYS is binary file defining the resource managers and device drivers loaded. Directives. DR DOS 5.0 and higher only Defines labels in CONFIG.SYS as jump targets for CHAIN DRSWITCH GOTO GOSUB and SWITCH directives. DOS 6.0 and DR DOS 6.0 and higher Similar to REM but can be used also for in-line comments following other CONFIG.SYS directives. See COMMENT. Under MS-DOS/PC DOS the inline-comment is not ignored if put in double-quotes. PTS-DOS only Used to lead in in-line comments in addition to the directive. . DR DOS 3.41 and higher Embedded DOS and FreeDOS only Displays Yes/No query and since DR DOS 5.0 optional message to ask the user for confirmation to execute the following CONFIG.SYS directives. FreeDOS does not support optional messages but optional conditions in conjunction with boot menus defined with MENU and MENUDEFAULT. DOS 6.0 and higher supports similar feature by adding. after the corresponding CONFIG.SYS directive f.e. DEVICE. or DEVICE instead of DEVICE. This variant is also supported by DR DOS. . FreeDOS only Unconditionally execute the following CONFIG.SYS directive. A‍–‍C ABORT PTS-DOS only Specifies if programs can be aborted on errors. ACCDATE MS-DOS 7.0 and higher only ignored under DR-DOS 7.02 and higher Configures which drives should store file access date stamps in the reserved area of directory entries in FAT file systems. AT PTS-DOS only Conditional execution on AT-compatible machines only. AUTOCHECK PTS-DOS only Boot manager. AUTOFAIL OS/2 only Configures verbosity of error messages. AUX DR-DOS 7.02 and higher only Changes internal default serial device driver COM1 to COM4 for AUX device. AVAILDEV DOS 2.0-2.1 and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher only Disables the availability of character devices outside phantom \DEV directory. BASEDEV OS/2 only Loads base device driver into memory. BEEP DR-DOS 7.02 and higher only Emits short beep even if audible notifications are disabled via SWITCHES=/Q. BOOTNEXT DRMK only Specifies operating system to be booted. BREAK DOS 2.0 and DR DOS 3.31 and higher OS/2 Sets or clears extended Ctrl+C checking. BUFFERS DOS 2.0 and DR DOS 3.31 and higher OS/2 Specifies the number of disk buffers to allocate. BUFFERSHIGH MS-DOS 7.0 and DR-DOS 7.02 and higher and FreeDOS only Same as BUFFERS but explicitly loads buffers into HMA or UMB like HIBUFFERS under DR DOS 6.0 and higher. CACHESIZE Embedded DOS 6-XL only Maximum number of 512-byte cache blocks dynamically allocated from system pool. CACHETTL Embedded DOS 6-XL only Maximum time in ms before unused cache blocks are returned to system pool. CACHEFLUSH Embedded DOS 6-XL only Maximum time in ms before dirty cache block gets flushed to disk. CALL OS/2 4.0 and higher only Similar to INSTALL under DOS loads programs in CONFIG.SYS. Similar to RUN under OS/2 but runs in foreground and halts CONFIG.SYS processing until return. CAPSLOCK DR-DOS 7.02 and higher only Specifies whether the keyboard Caps Lock status is turned on or off. CDDNAME PTS-DOS only Specifies the name of the CD-ROM hardware driver.

Issues The system can still boot if this file is missing or corrupted. However this file along with AUTOEXEC.BAT is essential for the complete bootup process to occur with the DOS operating system. These files contain information that is used to customize the operating system for personal use. They also contain the requirements of different software application packages. DOS system would require troubleshooting if either of these files became damaged or corrupted. If CONFIG.SYS does not contain SHELL directive or the file is corrupt or missing DOS typically searches for COMMAND.COM in the root directory of the boot drive. If this is not found versions of DOS before 6.0 will not start up. MS-DOS 6.0/PC DOS 6.1 and Novell DOS and higher will instead display prompt to enter the path and filename of command processor. This recovery prompt is also displayed when the primary command processor is aborted due to faults or if it is exited deliberately. In the case of COMMAND.COM the internal EXIT command is disabled only when the shell was started with /P. This also provides limited means to replace the shell at runtime without having to reboot the system. Since the MS-DOS 7.0 and higher COMMAND.COM executable is incompatible with DR-DOS but typically resides in the root of drive in dual-boot scenarios with DR-DOS DR-DOS 7.02 and higher no longer allow to bypass SHELL directives in Ctrl+ F5/F7/F8 skip trace step modes. Some later issues added Ctrl+ F6 to reinvoke the former F5 skip behaviour in order to allow recovery from problems with invalid SHELL arguments as well. Also if no SHELL directive could be found when skipping CONFIG.SYS processing via Ctrl+ F5 and also with Ctrl+ F7/F8 when the default file extension has been changed with SYS /DR ext the user is prompted to enter valid shell file name before trying to load COMMAND.COM from the root. Pressing Enter without specifying file will assume the former default.Depending on the version the size of the CONFIG.SYS file is limited to few kilobytes under MS-DOS/PC DOS up to 64 KB in most recent versions whereas the file 's size is unlimited under DR-DOS. This is because the former operating systems since DOS 3.0 will compile the file into some tokenized in-memory representation before they sort and regroup the directives to be processed in specific order with device drivers always being loaded before TSRs whereas DR-DOS interprets the file and executes most directives line-by-line thereby giving full control over the load order of drivers and TSRs via DEVICE and INSTALL for example to solve load order conflicts or to load program debugger before device driver to be debugged and allowing to adapt the user interaction and change the flow through the file based on conditions like processor types installed any type of keys pressed load or input errors occurring or return codes given by loaded software. This becomes particularly useful since INSTALL can also be used to run non-resident software under DR-DOS so that temporary external programs can be integrated into the CONFIG.SYS control flow.In MS-DOS/PC DOS 2.0 through 4.01 the length of the SHELL line was limited to 31 characters whereas up to 128 characters are possible in later versions. DR-DOS even accepts up to 255 characters. CONFIG.SYS directives do not accept long filenames. Dual booting DOS and Windows 9x When installing Windows 95 over preexisting DOS/Windows install CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT are renamed to CONFIG.DOS and AUTOEXEC.DOS. This is intended to ease dual booting between Windows 9x and DOS. When booting into DOS they are temporarily renamed CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT. Backups of the Windows 95 versions are made as CONFIG.W40 and AUTOEXEC.W40 files. When Caldera DR-DOS 7.02/7.03 is installed on system already containing Windows 95 Windows CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT retain those names. DR-DOS startup files are installed as DCONFIG.SYS name already used in earlier versions of DR DOS and AUTODOS7.BAT. OS/2 Windows NT OS/2 uses the CONFIG.SYS file extensively for setting up its configuration drivers and environment before the graphical part of the system loads. In the OS/2 subsystem of Windows NT what appeared as CONFIG.SYS to OS/2 programs was actually stored in the registry. There are many undocumented or poorly documented CONFIG.SYS directives used by OS/2.CONFIG.SYS continues to be used by the OS/2 derivatives eComStation and ArcaOS.

Tenuis alveolar click,The voiceless or more precisely tenuis post alveolar click is click consonant found primarily among the languages of southern Africa.

The Doke/Beach convention adopted for time by the IPA and still preferred by some linguists is ⟨ʗ⟩.,The voiceless or more precisely tenuis post alveolar click is click consonant found primarily among the languages of southern Africa. The symbol in the International Phonetic Alphabet that represents this sound is ⟨ǃ⟩. The Doke/Beach convention adopted for time by the IPA and still preferred by some linguists is ⟨ʗ⟩. Features Features of the tenuis post alveolar click The airstream mechanism is lingual ingressive also known as velaric ingressive which means pocket of air trapped between two closures is rarefied by sucking action of the tongue rather than being moved by the glottis or the lungs/diaphragm. The release of the forward closure produces the click sound. Voiced and nasal clicks have simultaneous pulmonic egressive airstream. Its place of articulation is alveolar which means it is articulated with either the tip or the blade of the tongue at the alveolar ridge termed respectively apical and laminal. Its phonation is voiceless unaspirated and unglottalized which means it is produced without vibration or constriction of the vocal cords and any following vowel starts without significant delay. It is an oral consonant which means air is allowed to escape through the mouth only. It is central consonant which means it is produced by directing the airstream along the center of the tongue rather than to the sides. Occurrence Tenuis alveolar clicks are found primarily in the various Khoisan language families of southern Africa and in some neighboring Bantu languages. References.

Chess annotation symbols,When annotating chess games commentators frequently use widely recognized annotation symbols. Question marks and exclamation points that denote move as bad or good are ubiquitous in chess literature. Some publications intended for an international audience such as the Chess Informant have wide range of additional symbols that transcend language barriers.The common symbols for evaluating the merits of move are. . . . . and. The chosen symbol is appended to the text describing the move e.g. Re7. or Kh1. see Algebraic chess notation. Use of these annotation symbols is subjective as different annotators use the same symbols differently. Moreover an annotator 's use of symbols is often influenced by the player 's strength for example positional misjudgment that an annotator might give. if played by strong grandmaster might pass unremarked if played by novice. Annotators use of punctuation may also be influenced by the result of the game regardless of the actual quality of the move this tendency is sometimes referred to as annotation by result.,When annotating chess games commentators frequently use widely recognized annotation symbols.

Annotators use of punctuation may also be influenced by the result of the game regardless of the actual quality of the move this tendency is sometimes referred to as annotation by result. Evaluation symbols Moves Move evaluation symbols by increasing effectiveness of the move ====. . Blunder ==== The double question mark. indicates blunder very bad move that severely worsens the player 's position. Typical moves that receive double question marks are those that overlook tactic that wins substantial material or overlook checkmate. . -worthy move usually results in an immediately lost position. Occasionally the sign is used for move that transforms won position into draw perhaps because the annotator feels that the mistake is unworthy of the player 's skill level. Blunders occur at all levels of play to all human competitors. ====. Mistake ==== single question mark. indicates that the annotator thinks that the move is poor one and that it should not have been played. Mistakes often lead to loss of tempo material or otherwise worsening of the player 's position. The nature of mistake may be more strategic than tactical in some cases the move receiving question mark may be one for which it is difficult to find refutation. move that overlooks forthcoming brilliant combination from the opponent would rarely receive more than one question mark for example. Whether single or double question mark is used is subjective and may depend on the player 's strength. For instance if beginner makes serious strategic error for instance accepting gratuitous pawn weaknesses or exchanging into lost endgame or overlooks tactical sequence this might be explained by the beginner 's lack of skill and be given only one question mark. If master were to make the same move some annotators might use the double question mark to indicate that one would never expect player of master strength to make such weak move. ====. . Dubious move ==== This symbol is similar to the. below but usually indicates that the annotator believes the move to be dubious or questionable but to possibly have merits. The. may also indicate that the annotator believes the move is weak/deserving of criticism but not bad enough to warrant. sacrifice leading to dangerous attack that the opponent should be able to defend against if they play well may receive. Alternatively this may denote move that is objectively bad but sets up an attractive trap. ====. . Interesting move ==== The. is one of the more controversial symbols. Different books have slightly varying definitions. Among the definitions are interesting but perhaps not the best move move deserving attention enterprising move and risky move. Usually it indicates that the move leads to exciting or wild play but that the objective evaluation of the move is unclear. It is also often used when player sets cunning trap in lost position. Typical moves receiving. are those involving speculative sacrifices or dangerous attacks that might turn out to be strategically deficient. Andrew Soltis jokingly called. the symbol of the lazy annotator who finds move interesting but can not be bothered to work out whether it is good or bad. ====. Good move ==== An exclamation point. indicates good move—especially one that is surprising or requires particular skill. The symbol may also be interpreted as best move. Annotators are usually somewhat conservative with the use of this symbol. Reasons for awarding the symbol vary widely between annotators among them are strong opening novelties well-timed breakthroughs sound sacrifices moves that set traps in lost positions moves that avoid such traps and good psychological choices in the opening. ====. . Brilliant move ==== The double exclamation point. is used for very strong moves such as sound sacrifices of large amounts of material and counter-intuitive moves that prove very powerful. For example in what is known as the Game of the Century the majority of annotators have awarded double exclamation point to 13-year-old Bobby Fischer 's decision to sacrifice his queen. ==== Others ==== few writers have used three or more exclamation points. for exceptionally brilliant moves. For example when annotating Rotlewi–Rubinstein 1907 Hans Kmoch awarded Rubinstein 's 22 ... Rxc3 three exclamation points. Likewise an exceptionally bad blunder may be awarded three or more question marks. The majority of chess writers and editors consider these symbols unnecessary. few writers have used unusual combinations of question marks and exclamation points e.g. . . . for particularly unusual spectacular or controversial moves but these have no generally accepted meaning and are typically used for humorous or entertainment purposes. Sometimes annotation symbols are put in parentheses e.g. . . Different writers have used these in different ways for example Ludek Pachman used. to indicate move that he considered inferior but that he did not wish to comment on further Simon Webb used it to indicate move that is objectively sound but was in his opinion poor psychological choice and Robert Hübner see below used it to indicate move that is inaccurate and makes the player 's task more difficult. Alternative uses Some writers take less subjective or more formalized approach to these symbols. ==== Nunn 's convention ==== In his 1992 book Secrets of Rook Endings and other books in the series Secrets of Minor-Piece Endings and Secrets of Pawnless Endings John Nunn uses these symbols in more specific way in the context of endgames where the optimal line of play can be determined with certainty This convention has been used in some later works such as Fundamental Chess Endings and Secrets of Pawn Endings by Karsten Müller and Frank Lamprecht but it can be safely assumed the convention is not being used unless there is specific note otherwise. The Nunn convention can not be used to annotate full games because the exact evaluation of position is generally impractical to compute. In 1959 Euwe and Hooper made the same use of the question mark ... decisive error .... ==== Hübner 's approach ==== German grandmaster Robert Hübner prefers an even more specific and restrained use of move evaluation symbols have attached question marks to the moves which change winning position into drawn game or drawn position into losing one according to my judgment move which changes winning game into losing one deserves two question marks .... have distributed question marks in brackets to moves which are obviously inaccurate and significantly increase the difficulty of the player 's task .... There are no exclamation marks as they serve no useful purpose. The best move should be mentioned in the analysis in any case an exclamation mark can only serve to indicate the personal excitement of the commentator. ==== Chess composition ==== When the solution to certain chess problem is given there are also some conventions that have become common practice Key move is marked with at least one. Try move is marked with. Refutation to try move is marked with. When dual avoidance is part of the thematic content of problem avoided duals if listed are marked with. Positions These symbols indicate the strategic balance of the game position Other symbols There are other symbols used by various chess engines and publications such as Chess Informant and Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings when annotating moves or describing positions. Many of the symbols now have Unicode encodings but quite few still require special chess font with appropriated characters.

Although directly computing large factorials using the product formula or recurrence is not efficient faster algorithms are known matching to within constant factor the time for fast multiplication algorithms for numbers with the same number of digits. History The concept of factorials has arisen independently in many cultures In Indian mathematics one of the earliest known descriptions of factorials comes from the Anuyogadvāra-sūtra one of the canonical works of Jain literature which has been assigned dates varying from 300 BCE to 400 CE. It separates out the sorted and reversed order of set of items from the other mixed orders evaluating the number of mixed orders by subtracting two from the usual product formula for the factorial. The product rule for permutations was also described by 6th-century CE Jain monk Jinabhadra. Hindu scholars have been using factorial formulas since at least 1150 when Bhāskara II mentioned factorials in his work Līlāvatī in connection with problem of how many ways Vishnu could hold his four characteristic objects conch shell discus mace and lotus flower in his four hands and similar problem for ten-handed god. In the mathematics of the Middle East the Hebrew mystic book of creation Sefer Yetzirah from the Talmudic period 200 to 500 CE lists factorials up to. as part of an investigation into the number of words that can be formed from the Hebrew alphabet. Factorials were also studied for similar reasons by 8th-century Arab grammarian Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi. Arab mathematician Ibn al-Haytham also known as Alhazen c. 965 c. 1040 was the first to formulate Wilson 's theorem connecting the factorials with the prime numbers. In Europe although Greek mathematics included some combinatorics and Plato famously used 5,040 factorial as the population of an ideal community in part because of its divisibility properties there is no direct evidence of ancient Greek study of factorials. Instead the first work on factorials in Europe was by Jewish scholars such as Shabbethai Donnolo explicating the Sefer Yetzirah passage. In 1677 British author Fabian Stedman described the application of factorials to change ringing musical art involving the ringing of several tuned bells.From the late 15th century onward factorials became the subject of study by western mathematicians. In 1494 treatise Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli calculated factorials up to 11 in connection with problem of dining table arrangements. Christopher Clavius discussed factorials in 1603 commentary on the work of Johannes de Sacrobosco and in the 1640s French polymath Marin Mersenne published large but not entirely correct tables of factorials up to 64 based on the work of Clavius. The power series for the exponential function with the reciprocals of factorials for its coefficients was first formulated in 1676 by Isaac Newton in letter to Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. Other important works of early European mathematics on factorials include extensive coverage in 1685 treatise by John Wallis study of their approximate values for large values of \displaystyle by Abraham de Moivre in 1721 1729 letter from James Stirling to de Moivre stating what became known as Stirling 's approximation and work at the same time by Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler formulating the continuous extension of the factorial function to the gamma function. Adrien-Marie Legendre included Legendre 's formula describing the exponents in the factorization of factorials into prime powers in an 1808 text on number theory.The notation. \displaystyle. for factorials was introduced by the French mathematician Christian Kramp in 1808. Many other notations have also been used. Another later notation in which the argument of the factorial was half-enclosed by the left and bottom sides of box was popular for some time in Britain and America but fell out of use perhaps because it is difficult to typeset. The word factorial originally French factorielle was first used in 1800 by Louis François Antoine Arbogast in the first work on Faà di Bruno 's formula but referring to more general concept of products of arithmetic progressions. The factors that this name refers to are the terms of the product formula for the factorial. Definition The factorial function of positive integer \displaystyle is defined by the product of all positive integers not greater than \displaystyle This may be written more concisely in product notation as If this product formula is changed to keep all but the last term it would define product of the same form for smaller factorial. This leads to recurrence relation according to which each value of the factorial function can be obtained by multiplying the previous value by \displaystyle For example. . 24 120 \displaystyle =5\cdot =5\cdot 24=120. Factorial of zero The factorial of \displaystyle is \displaystyle or in symbols. \displaystyle =1. There are several motivations for this definition For \displaystyle n=0 the definition of. \displaystyle. as product involves the product of no numbers at all and so is an example of the broader convention that the empty product product of no factors is equal to the multiplicative identity. There is exactly one permutation of zero objects with nothing to permute the only rearrangement is to do nothing. This convention makes many identities in combinatorics valid for all valid choices of their parameters. For instance the number of ways to choose all \displaystyle elements from set of \displaystyle is. . . \textstyle \tbinom \tfrac. =1 binomial coefficient identity that would only be valid with. \displaystyle =1. With. \displaystyle =1 the recurrence relation for the factorial remains valid at \displaystyle n=1. Therefore with this convention recursive computation of the factorial needs to have only the value for zero as base case simplifying the computation and avoiding the need for additional special cases. Setting. \displaystyle =1 allows for the compact expression of many formulae such as the exponential function as power series. . \textstyle e^ =\sum n=0 \infty \frac x^. This choice matches the gamma function. \displaystyle =\Gamma 0+1 =1 and the gamma function must have this value to be continuous function. Applications The earliest uses of the factorial function involve counting permutations there are. \displaystyle. different ways of arranging \displaystyle distinct objects into sequence. Factorials appear more broadly in many formulas in combinatorics to account for different orderings of objects. For instance the binomial coefficients \displaystyle \tbinom count the \displaystyle -element combinations subsets of \displaystyle elements from set with \displaystyle elements and can be computed from factorials using the formula The Stirling numbers of the first kind sum to the factorials and count the permutations of \displaystyle grouped into subsets with the same numbers of cycles. Another combinatorial application is in counting derangements permutations that do not leave any element in its original position the number of derangements of \displaystyle items is the nearest integer to. \displaystyle /e. In algebra the factorials arise through the binomial theorem which uses binomial coefficients to expand powers of sums. They also occur in the coefficients used to relate certain families of polynomials to each other for instance in Newton 's identities for symmetric polynomials. Their use in counting permutations can also be restated algebraically the factorials are the orders of finite symmetric groups. In calculus factorials occur in Faà di Bruno 's formula for chaining higher derivatives. In mathematical analysis factorials frequently appear in the denominators of power series most notably in the series for the exponential function and in the coefficients of other Taylor series in particular those of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions where they cancel factors of. \displaystyle. coming from the \displaystyle th derivative of \displaystyle x^. This usage of factorials in power series connects back to analytic combinatorics through the exponential generating function which for combinatorial class with \displaystyle n_ elements of size \displaystyle is defined as the power series In number theory the most salient property of factorials is the divisibility of. \displaystyle. by all positive integers up to \displaystyle described more precisely for prime factors by Legendre 's formula. It follows that arbitrarily large prime numbers can be found as the prime factors of the numbers. \displaystyle \pm leading to proof of Euclid 's theorem that the number of primes is infinite. When. \displaystyle \pm is itself prime it is called factorial prime relatedly Brocard 's problem also posed by Srinivasa Ramanujan concerns the existence of square numbers of the form. \displaystyle +1. In contrast the numbers. . . \displaystyle +2 +3 \dots +n must all be composite proving the existence of arbitrarily large prime gaps. An elementary proof of Bertrand 's postulate on the existence of prime in any interval of the form \displaystyle n,2n one of the first results of Paul Erdős was based on the divisibility properties of factorials. The factorial number system is mixed radix notation for numbers in which the place values of each digit are factorials.Factorials are used extensively in probability theory for instance in the Poisson distribution and in the probabilities of random permutations. In computer science beyond appearing in the analysis of brute-force searches over permutations factorials arise in the lower bound of log. log \displaystyle \log =n\log n-O on the number of comparisons needed to comparison sort set of \displaystyle items and in the analysis of chained hash tables where the distribution of keys per cell can be accurately approximated by Poisson distribution. Moreover factorials naturally appear in formulae from quantum and statistical physics where one often considers all the possible permutations of set of particles. In statistical mechanics calculations of entropy such as Boltzmann 's entropy formula or the Sackur–Tetrode equation must correct the count of microstates by dividing by the factorials of the numbers of each type of indistinguishable particle to avoid the Gibbs paradox. Quantum physics provides the underlying reason for why these corrections are necessary. Properties Growth and approximation As function of \displaystyle the factorial has faster than exponential growth but grows more slowly than double exponential function. Its growth rate is similar to \displaystyle n^ but slower by an exponential factor. One way of approaching this result is by taking the natural logarithm of the factorial which turns its product formula into sum and then estimating the sum by an integral Exponentiating the result and ignoring the negligible \displaystyle +1 term approximates. \displaystyle. as \displaystyle n/e. More carefully bounding the sum both above and below by an integral using the trapezoid rule shows that this estimate needs correction factor proportional to \displaystyle \sqrt. The constant of proportionality for this correction can be found from the Wallis product which expresses \displaystyle \pi as limiting ratio of factorials and powers of two. The result of these corrections is Stirling 's approximation Here the \displaystyle \sim symbol means that as \displaystyle goes to infinity the ratio between the left and right sides approaches one in the limit. Stirling 's formula provides the first term in an asymptotic series that becomes even more accurate when taken to greater numbers of terms An alternative version uses only odd exponents in the correction terms Many other variations of these formulas have also been developed by Srinivasa Ramanujan Bill Gosper and others.The binary logarithm of the factorial used to analyze comparison sorting can be very accurately estimated using Stirling 's approximation. In the formula below the \displaystyle term invokes big notation. Divisibility and digits The product formula for the factorial implies that. \displaystyle. is divisible by all prime numbers that are at most \displaystyle and by no larger prime numbers. More precise information about its divisibility is given by Legendre 's formula which gives the exponent of each prime \displaystyle in the prime factorization of. \displaystyle. as Here \displaystyle s_ denotes the sum of the base- \displaystyle digits of \displaystyle and the exponent given by this formula can also be interpreted in advanced mathematics as the p-adic valuation of the factorial. Applying Legendre 's formula to the product formula for binomial coefficients produces Kummer 's theorem similar result on the exponent of each prime in the factorization of binomial coefficient. Grouping the prime factors of the factorial into prime powers in different ways produces the multiplicative partitions of factorials.The special case of Legendre 's formula for \displaystyle p=5 gives the number of trailing zeros in the decimal representation of the factorials. According to this formula the number of zeros can be obtained by subtracting the base-5 digits of \displaystyle from \displaystyle and dividing the result by four. Legendre 's formula implies that the exponent of the prime \displaystyle p=2 is always larger than the exponent for \displaystyle p=5 so each factor of five can be paired with factor of two to produce one of these trailing zeros. The leading digits of the factorials are distributed according to Benford 's law. Every sequence of digits in any base is the sequence of initial digits of some factorial number in that base.Another result on divisibility of factorials Wilson 's theorem states that. \displaystyle n-1 +1 is divisible by \displaystyle if and only if \displaystyle is prime number. For any given integer \displaystyle the Kempner function of \displaystyle is given by the smallest \displaystyle for which \displaystyle divides. \displaystyle. . For almost all numbers all but subset of exceptions with asymptotic density zero it coincides with the largest prime factor of \displaystyle. The product of two factorials. . \displaystyle \cdot. always evenly divides. \displaystyle m+n. . There are infinitely many factorials that equal the product of other factorials if \displaystyle is itself any product of factorials then. \displaystyle. equals that same product multiplied by one more factorial. \displaystyle n-1. . The only known examples of factorials that are products of other factorials but are not of this trivial form are. . . . . \displaystyle =7 \cdot \cdot \cdot. 10. . . . . . \displaystyle 10 =7 \cdot =7 \cdot \cdot. and 16. 14. . . \displaystyle 16 =14 \cdot \cdot. . It would follow from the abc conjecture that there are only finitely many nontrivial examples.The greatest common divisor of the values of primitive polynomial of degree \displaystyle over the integers evenly divides. \displaystyle. . Continuous interpolation and non-integer generalization There are infinitely many ways to extend the factorials to continuous function. The most widely used of these uses the gamma function which can be defined for positive real numbers as the integral The resulting function is related to the factorial of non-negative integer \displaystyle by the equation which can be used as definition of the factorial for non-integer arguments. At all values \displaystyle for which both \displaystyle \Gamma and \displaystyle \Gamma x-1 are defined the gamma function obeys the functional equation generalizing the recurrence relation for the factorials.The same integral converges more generally for any complex number \displaystyle whose real part is positive. It can be extended to the non-integer points in the rest of the complex plane by solving for Euler 's reflection formula However this formula can not be used at integers because for them the sin \displaystyle \sin \pi term would produce division by zero. The result of this extension process is an analytic function the analytic continuation of the integral formula for the gamma function. It has nonzero value at all complex numbers except for the non-positive integers where it has simple poles. Correspondingly this provides definition for the factorial at all complex numbers other than the negative integers. One property of the gamma function distinguishing it from other continuous interpolations of the factorials is given by the Bohr–Mollerup theorem which states that the gamma function offset by one is the only log-convex function on the positive real numbers that interpolates the factorials and obeys the same functional equation. related uniqueness theorem of Helmut Wielandt states that the complex gamma function and its scalar multiples are the only holomorphic functions on the positive complex half-plane that obey the functional equation and remain bounded for complex numbers with real part between and 2.Other complex functions that interpolate the factorial values include Hadamard 's gamma function which is an entire function over all the complex numbers including the non-positive integers. In the p-adic numbers it is not possible to continuously interpolate the factorial function directly because the factorials of large integers dense subset of the p-adics converge to zero according to Legendre 's formula forcing any continuous function that is close to their values to be zero everywhere. Instead the p-adic gamma function provides continuous interpolation of modified form of the factorial omitting the factors in the factorial that are divisible by p.The digamma function is the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function. Just as the gamma function provides continuous interpolation of the factorials offset by one the digamma function provides continuous interpolation of the harmonic numbers offset by the Euler–Mascheroni constant. Computation The factorial function is common feature in scientific calculators. It is also included in scientific programming libraries such as the Python mathematical functions module and the Boost C++ library. If efficiency is not concern computing factorials is trivial just successively multiply variable initialized to \displaystyle by the integers up to \displaystyle. The simplicity of this computation makes it common example in the use of different computer programming styles and methods.The computation of. \displaystyle. can be expressed in pseudocode using iteration as define factorial for ... return or using recursion based on its recurrence relation as define factorial if return return factorial Other methods suitable for its computation include memoization dynamic programming and functional programming. The computational complexity of these algorithms may be analyzed using the unit-cost random-access machine model of computation in which each arithmetic operation takes constant time and each number uses constant amount of storage space. In this model these methods can compute. \displaystyle. in time \displaystyle and the iterative version uses space \displaystyle. Unless optimized for tail recursion the recursive version takes linear space to store its call stack. However this model of computation is only suitable when \displaystyle is small enough to allow. \displaystyle. to fit into machine word. The values 12. and 20. are the largest factorials that can be stored in respectively the 32-bit and 64-bit integers. Floating point can represent larger factorials but approximately rather than exactly and will still overflow for factorials larger than 170. \displaystyle 170. . The exact computation of larger factorials involves arbitrary-precision arithmetic because of fast growth and integer overflow. Time of computation can be analyzed as function of the number of digits or bits in the result. By Stirling 's formula. \displaystyle. has log \displaystyle b=O n\log bits. The Schönhage–Strassen algorithm can produce \displaystyle -bit product in time log log log \displaystyle b\log b\log \log and faster multiplication algorithms taking time log \displaystyle b\log are known. However computing the factorial involves repeated products rather than single multiplication so these time bounds do not apply directly. In this setting computing. \displaystyle. by multiplying the numbers from to \displaystyle in sequence is inefficient because it involves \displaystyle multiplications constant fraction of which take time log \displaystyle n\log each giving total time log \displaystyle n^ \log. better approach is to perform the multiplications as divide-and-conquer algorithm that multiplies sequence of \displaystyle numbers by splitting it into two subsequences of \displaystyle i/2 numbers multiplies each subsequence and combines the results with one last multiplication. This approach to the factorial takes total time log \displaystyle n\log one logarithm comes from the number of bits in the factorial second comes from the multiplication algorithm and third comes from the divide and conquer.Even better efficiency is obtained by computing. from its prime factorization based on the principle that exponentiation by squaring is faster than expanding an exponent into product. An algorithm for this by Arnold Schönhage begins by finding the list of the primes up to \displaystyle for instance using the sieve of Eratosthenes and uses Legendre 's formula to compute the exponent for each prime. Then it computes the product of the prime powers with these exponents using recursive algorithm as follows Use divide and conquer to compute the product of the primes whose exponents are odd Divide all of the exponents by two rounding down to an integer recursively compute the product of the prime powers with these smaller exponents and square the result Multiply together the results of the two previous stepsThe product of all primes up to \displaystyle is an \displaystyle -bit number by the prime number theorem so the time for the first step is log \displaystyle n\log with one logarithm coming from the divide and conquer and another coming from the multiplication algorithm. In the recursive calls to the algorithm the prime number theorem can again be invoked to prove that the numbers of bits in the corresponding products decrease by constant factor at each level of recursion so the total time for these steps at all levels of recursion adds in geometric series to log \displaystyle n\log. The time for the squaring in the second step and the multiplication in the third step are again log \displaystyle n\log because each is single multiplication of number with log \displaystyle n\log bits. Again at each level of recursion the numbers involved have constant fraction as many bits because otherwise repeatedly squaring them would produce too large final result so again the amounts of time for these steps in the recursive calls add in geometric series to log \displaystyle n\log. Consequentially the whole algorithm takes time log \displaystyle n\log proportional to single multiplication with the same number of bits in its result. Related sequences and functions Several other integer sequences are similar to or related to the factorials Alternating factorial The alternating factorial is the absolute value of the alternating sum of the first \displaystyle factorials. \textstyle \sum i=1 -1 n-i. . These have mainly been studied in connection with their primality only finitely many of them can be prime but complete list of primes of this form is not known. Bhargava factorial The Bhargava factorials are family of integer sequences defined by Manjul Bhargava with similar number-theoretic properties to the factorials including the factorials themselves as special case. Double factorial The product of all the odd integers up to some odd positive integer \displaystyle is called the double factorial of \displaystyle and denoted by. . \displaystyle. . That is For example. 945. Double factorials are used in trigonometric integrals in expressions for the gamma function at half-integers and the volumes of hyperspheres and in counting binary trees and perfect matchings. Exponential factorial Just as triangular numbers sum the numbers from \displaystyle to \displaystyle and factorials take their product the exponential factorial exponentiates. The exponential factorial is defined recursively as \displaystyle a_ =1 a_ =n^ a_ n-1. For example the exponential factorial of is These numbers grow much more quickly than regular factorials. Falling factorial The notations \displaystyle or \displaystyle x^ \underline are sometimes used to represent the product of the \displaystyle integers counting up to and including \displaystyle equal to. . \displaystyle x-n. . This is also known as falling factorial or backward factorial and the \displaystyle notation is Pochhammer symbol. Falling factorials count the number of different sequences of \displaystyle distinct items that can be drawn from universe of \displaystyle items. They occur as coefficients in the higher derivatives of polynomials and in the factorial moments of random variables. Hyperfactorials The hyperfactorial of \displaystyle is the product \displaystyle 1^ \cdot 2^ \cdots n^. These numbers form the discriminants of Hermite polynomials. They can be continuously interpolated by the K-function and obey analogues to Stirling 's formula and Wilson 's theorem. Jordan–Pólya numbers The Jordan–Pólya numbers are the products of factorials allowing repetitions. Every tree has symmetry group whose number of symmetries is Jordan–Pólya number and every Jordan–Pólya number counts the symmetries of some tree. Primorial The primorial \displaystyle n\ is the product of prime numbers less than or equal to \displaystyle this construction gives them some similar divisibility properties to factorials but unlike factorials they are squarefree. As with the factorial primes. \displaystyle \pm researchers have studied primorial primes \displaystyle n\ \pm. Subfactorial The subfactorial yields the number of derangements of set of \displaystyle objects. It is sometimes denoted. \displaystyle and equals the closest integer to. \displaystyle /e. Superfactorial The superfactorial of \displaystyle is the product of the first \displaystyle factorials. The superfactorials are continuously interpolated by the Barnes G-function.

Exclamation mark,The exclamation mark or exclamation point American English is punctuation mark usually used after an interjection or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or to show emphasis. The exclamation mark often marks the end of sentence for example Watch out. Similarly bare exclamation mark with nothing before or after is often used in warning signs. The exclamation mark is often used in writing to make character seem as though they are shouting and/or excited/surprised. Other uses include In mathematics it denotes the factorial operation. Several computer languages use. at the beginning of an expression to denote logical negation. For example means the logical negation of also called not. This usage has spread to ordinary language e.g. clue means no-clue or clueless. Some languages use. to denote click consonant.,The exclamation mark or exclamation point American English is punctuation mark usually used after an interjection or exclamation to indicate strong feelings or to show emphasis.

This usage has spread to ordinary language e.g. clue means no-clue or clueless. Some languages use. to denote click consonant. History Graphically the exclamation mark is represented by variations on the theme of full stop point with vertical line above. One theory of its origin posits derivation from Latin exclamation of joy namely io analogous to hurray copyists wrote the Latin word io at the end of sentence to indicate expression of joy. Over time the moved above the that first became smaller and with time dot.In the 15th century the exclamation mark was introduced into English printing to show emphasis. It was later called by many names including point of admiration 1611 note of exclamation or admiration 1657 sign of admiration or exclamation exclamation point 1824 and finally exclamation mark 1839 .Many older or portable typewriters did not have the exclamation mark. Instead the user typed full stop and then backspaced and overtyped an apostrophe. Slang and other names for the exclamation mark Now obsolete the name ecphoneme was documented in the early 20th century.In the 1950s secretarial dictation and typesetting manuals in America referred to the mark as bang perhaps from comic books where the. appeared in dialogue balloons to represent gun being fired although the nickname probably emerged from letterpress printing. This bang usage is behind the names of the interrobang an unconventional typographic character and shebang feature of Unix computer systems. In the printing world the exclamation mark can be called screamer gasper slammer dog 's cock or startler.In hacker culture the exclamation mark is called bang shriek or in the British slang known as Commonwealth Hackish pling. For example the password communicated in the spoken phrase Your password is em-zero-pee-aitch-bang-en-three em-nought-pee-aitch-pling-en-three in Commonwealth Hackish is m0ph n3. Languages The exclamation mark is common to languages using the Latin alphabet although usage varies slightly between languages. It has also been adopted in languages written in other scripts such as languages written with Cyrillic or Arabic scripts Chinese characters and Devanagari. English sentence ending in an exclamation mark may represent an exclamation or an interjection such as Wow. Boo. or an imperative Stop. or may indicate astonishment or surprise They were the footprints of gigantic hound. Exclamation marks are occasionally placed mid-sentence with function similar to comma for dramatic effect although this usage is obsolete On the walk oh. there was frightful noise. Informally exclamation marks may be repeated for additional emphasis That 's great. but this practice is generally considered unacceptable in formal prose.The exclamation mark is sometimes used in conjunction with the question mark. This can be in protest or astonishment Out of all places the squatter-camp. few writers replace this with single nonstandard punctuation mark the interrobang which is the combination of question mark and an exclamation mark.Overly frequent use of the exclamation mark is generally considered poor writing as it distracts the reader and decreases the mark 's significance. Cut out all these exclamation points ... An exclamation point is like laughing at your own joke. Some authors most notably Tom Wolfe are known for unashamedly liberal use of the exclamation mark. In comic books the very frequent use of exclamation mark is common—see Comics below. For information on the use of spaces after an exclamation mark see the discussion of spacing after full stop. Several studies have shown that women use exclamation marks more than men do. One study suggests that in addition to other uses exclamation marks may also function as markers of friendly interaction for example by making Hi. or Good luck. seem friendlier than simply Hi. or Good luck. with periods. However use of exclamation marks in contexts that are not unambiguously positive can be misinterpreted as indicating hostility. In English writing and often subtitles. symbol an exclamation mark within parentheses implies that character has made an obviously sarcastic comment e.g. Ooh sarcasm detector. That 's really useful invention. It also is used to indicate surprise at one 's own experience or statement. French In French as well as marking exclamations or indicating astonishment the exclamation mark is also commonly used to mark orders or requests Viens ici. English 'Come here. When available 'narrow no-break space espace fine insécable is used between the last word and the exclamation mark in European French. If not regular non-breaking space espace insécable is currently used. In Canadian French either no space is used or small space espace fine insécable is inserted if available. One can also combine an exclamation mark with question mark at the end of sentence where appropriate. Fula in Adlam In Fula written in the Adlam script exclamative sentences start with U+1E95E ADLAM INITIAL EXCLAMATION MARK and end with the ASCII exclamation mark. For example 𞤢𞤤𞤢𞥄 No. German German uses the exclamation mark for several things that English conveys with other punctuation It is used at the end of imperative sentences even when not particularly emphatic Ruf mich morgen an. 'Call me tomorrow. normal full stop as in English is fairly common but is considered substandard. related use is on signs that express command or interdiction Betreten verboten. English 'No trespassing. The exclamation mark may also be used in the salutation line of letter Lieber Hans. English 'Dear Hans. However the use of comma is equally correct and is more common. Cantonese Cantonese has not historically used dedicated punctuation marks rather relying on grammatical markers to denote the end of statement. Usage of exclamation marks is common in written Mandarin and in some Yue speaking regions. The Canton and Hong Kong regions however generally refused to accept the exclamation mark as it was seen as carrying with it unnecessary and confusing Western connotations however an exclamation mark including in some written representations of colloquy in Cantonese can be used informally to indicate strong feeling. Mandarin Chinese It is called 感叹号 in China and 感嘆號 in Taiwan both pronounced Gǎn tàn hào. Greek In Modern Greek the exclamation mark Θαυμαστικό thavmastikó has been introduced from Latin scripts and is used identically although without the reluctance seen in English usage. minor grammatical difference is that while series of interjections each employ an exclamation mark e.g. Ωχ. Αχ Ōch. Ach 'Oops. Oh. an interjection should only be separated from an extended exclamation by comma e.g. Ωχ ξέχασα το μάτι της κουζίνας ανοιχτό Ōch xéchasa to máti tīs kouzínas anoichtó 'Oops. left the stove on. Hungarian In Hungarian an exclamation mark is put at the end of exclamatory imperative or prohibitive sentences and sentences expressing wish e.g. De szép. 'How beautiful. fűre lépni tilos. 'Keep off the grass Bárcsak sikerülne tervem. 'If only my plan would work out. The use of the exclamation mark is also needed when addressing someone and the addressing is separate sentence. typically at the beginning of letters e.g. Kedves Péter. 'Dear Peter. Greetings are also typically terminated with an exclamation mark e.g. Jó estét. 'Good evening. Solomon Islands Pidgin In Solomon Islands Pidgin the phrase may be between admiration marks. Compare Nomoa. No. and Nomoa nao. Certainly not. Spanish In Spanish sentence or clause ending in an exclamation mark must also begin with an inverted exclamation mark the same also applies to the question mark ¿Estás loco. ¡Casi la matas 'Are you crazy. You almost killed her. As in British English bracketed exclamation mark may be used to indicate irony or surprise at statement Dice que esta noche no va salir de fiesta. 'He said that he 's not going to party tonight. Such use is not matched by an inverted opening exclamation mark. Turkish In Turkish an exclamation mark is used after sentence or phrase for emphasis and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example in the Ordular. İlk hedefiniz Akdenizdir ileri. 'Armies. Your first target is the Mediterranean order by Atatürk ordular 'the armies constitute the addressee. It is further used in parentheses. after sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm Çok iyi bir iş yaptın. 'You 've done very good job Not. Limbu In Limbu an exclamation mark is used after Limbu sentence or phrase for emphasis and is common following both commands and the addressees of such commands. For example in the Limbu sentence ᤐᤚᤢ᥄ ᤄᤨᤘᤑ ᤂᤥᤆᤌᤙ Mediterranean ᤚᤦᤛᤅ᥄ Paṡu. Ghōwapha khōcathaśa Mediterranean ṡausaṅa. Armies. Your first target is the Mediterranean. It is further used in parentheses after sentence or phrase to indicate irony or sarcasm ᤖᤥᤂᤌ ᤔᤚᤗ ᤐᤤ ᤊᤇ ᤃᤦᤄ Rōkhatha maṡala pai yancha gaugha. You did very good job Not. Phonetics In Khoisan languages and the International Phonetic Alphabet the exclamation mark is used as letter to indicate the postalveolar click sound represented as in Zulu orthography. In Unicode this letter is properly coded as U+01C3 LATIN LETTER RETROFLEX CLICK and distinguished from the common punctuation symbol U+0021. EXCLAMATION MARK to allow software to deal properly with word breaks. The exclamation mark has sometimes been used as phonetic symbol to indicate that consonant is ejective. More commonly this is represented by an apostrophe or superscript glottal stop symbol U+02C0 MODIFIER LETTER GLOTTAL STOP. Proper names Although not part of dictionary words exclamation marks appear in some brand names and trade names including Yum. Brands parent of fast food chains like Taco Bell and KFC Web services Yahoo. and Joomla and the online game Kahoot. It appears in the titles of stage and screen works especially comedies and musicals examples include the game show Jeopardy. the '60s musical TV show Shindig. musicals Oklahoma Mamma Mia Oliver. and Oh. Calcutta. and movies Airplane. and Moulin Rouge. Writer Elliot. Maggin and cartoonist Scott Shaw. include exclamation marks in their names. In the 2016 United States presidential campaign Republican candidate Jeb Bush used Jeb. as his campaign logo. Place names The English town of Westward Ho named after the novel by Charles Kingsley is the only place name in the United Kingdom that officially contains an exclamation mark. There is town in Quebec called Saint-Louis-du-Ha. Ha which is spelled with two exclamation marks. The city of Hamilton Ohio changed its name to Hamilton. in 1986 but neither the United States Board on Geographic Names nor mapmakers Rand McNally recognised the change. The city of Ostrava Czech Republic changed its logotype to Ostrava. in 2008. Warnings Exclamation marks are used to emphasize precautionary statement. On warning signs an exclamation mark is often used to draw attention to warning of danger hazards and the unexpected. These signs are common in hazardous environments or on potentially dangerous equipment. common type of this warning is yellow triangle with black exclamation mark but white triangle with red border is common on European road warning signs. Use in various fields Mathematics and formal logic In elementary mathematics the symbol represents the factorial operation. The expression. means the product of the integers from to. For example. read four factorial is 24. . is defined as which is neutral element in multiplication not multiplied by anything. Additionally it can also represent the uniqueness quantifier or if used in front of number it can represent subfactorial. In linear logic the exclamation mark denotes one of the modalities that control weakening and contraction. Computing In computing the exclamation mark is ASCII character 33 21 in hexadecimal. Due to its availability on even early computers the character was used for many purposes. The name given to. by programmers varies according to their background though it was very common to give it short name to make reading code aloud easier. Bang is very popular. In the UK the term pling was popular in the earlier days of computing whilst in the United States the term shriek was used. It is claimed that these word usages were invented in the US and shriek is from Stanford or MIT however shriek for the. sign is found in the Oxford English Dictionary dating from the 1860s. Many computer languages using C-style syntax use. for logical negation means not and means is not equal to. This negation principle has spread to ordinary language for example the word clue is used as synonym for no-clue or clueless. The symbol in formal logic for negation is but as this symbol is not present as standard on some keyboards the convention has spread informally to other contexts. Early e-mail systems also used the exclamation mark as separator character between hostnames for routing information usually referred to as bang path notation. In the IRC protocol user 's nickname and ident are separated by an exclamation mark in the hostmask assigned to him or her by the server. In UNIX scripting typically for UNIX shell or Perl. is usually used after in the first line of script the interpreter directive to tell the OS what program to use to run the script. . is usually called hash-bang or shebang. similar convention for PostScript files calls for the first line to begin with called percent-bang .An exclamation mark starts history expansions in many Unix shells such as bash and tcsh where. . executes the previous command and. refers to all of the arguments from the previous command. Acorn RISC OS uses filenames starting with pling to create an application directory for instance file called Run is executed when the folder containing it is double-clicked holding down shift prevents this. There is also Boot executed the first time the application containing it comes into view of the filer Sprites icons Help and others. In APL is used for factorial of backwards from math notation and also for the binomial coefficient means \displaystyle \tbinom or ⁄k n–k. BBC BASIC used pling as an indirection operator equivalent to PEEK and POKE of four bytes at once.BCPL the precursor of used. for pointer and array indirection is equivalent to in and is equivalent to in C. In the Haskell programming language. is used to express strictness. In the Kotlin programming language. double-bang is the not-null assertion operator used to override null safety so as to allow null pointer exception.In the ML programming language including Standard ML and OCaml. is the operator to get the value out of reference data structure. In the Raku programming language the. twigil is used to access private attributes or methods in class like class Person has name or self private-method .In the Scheme Julia and Ruby programming languages. is conventionally the suffix for functions and special forms that mutate their input. In the Swift programming language type followed by. denotes an implicitly unwrapped optional an option type where the compiler does not enforce safe unwrapping. The. operator force unwraps an option type causing an error if it is nil. In Geek Code version. is used before letter to denote that the geek refuses to participate in the topic at hand. In some cases it has an alternate meaning such as. denoting geek of no qualifications denoting not wearing any clothes. denoting not being allowed to use Perl and so on. They all share some negative connotations however. Video games The exclamation mark can be used in video games to signify that character is startled or alarmed. In the Metal Gear and Paper Mario series an exclamation mark appears over enemies heads when they notice the player. In massively multiplayer online MMO games such as World of Warcraft an exclamation mark hovering over character 's head is often used to indicate that they are offering quest for the player to complete. In Dota an exclamation mark is shown above the head of unit if it is killed by means not granting enemies experience or gold if it is denied. In the 2005 arcade dance simulation game In the Groove there is song titled. also referred to as bang by the artist Onyx. Internet culture In Internet culture especially where leet is used multiple exclamation marks may be affixed with the numeral as in. 111. The notation originates from common error when typing multiple exclamation points quickly the typist may fail to hold the Shift1 combination that produces the exclamation mark on many keyboard layouts. This error first used intentionally as joke in the leet linguistic community is now an accepted form of exclamation in leet and derivative dialects such as Lolspeak. Some utterances include further substitutions for example. 111oneeleven .In fandom and fanfiction. is used to signify defining quality in character usually signifying an alternative interpretation of character from canonical work. Examples of this would be Romantic Draco or Vampire Harry from Harry Potter fandom. It is also used to clarify the current persona of character with multiple identities or appearances such as to distinguish Armor Al from Human Al in work based on Fullmetal Alchemist. The origin of this usage is unknown although it is hypothesized to have originated with certain Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles action figures for example Football Player. Leonardo Rockstar. Raphael and Breakdancer. Michelangelo. Comics Some comic books especially superhero comics of the mid-20th century routinely use the exclamation point instead of the period which means the character has just realized something unlike when the question mark appears instead which means the character is confused surprised or they do not know what is happening. This tends to lead to exaggerated speech in line with the other hyperboles common in comic books. portion of the motivation however was simply that period might disappear in the printing process used at the time whereas an exclamation point would likely remain recognizable even if there was printing glitch. For short period Stan Lee as editor-in-chief of Marvel Comics attempted to curb their overuse by short-lived ban on exclamation points altogether which led to an inadvertent lack of ending punctuation on many sentences.Comic book writer Elliot. Maggin once accidentally signed his name with an exclamation due to the habit of using them when writing comic scripts it became his professional name from then on. Similarly comic artist Scott Shaw. has used the exclamation point after his name throughout his career. In comic books and comics in general large exclamation point is often used near or over character 's head to indicate surprise. question mark can similarly be used to indicate confusion. Chess In chess notation. denotes good move. denotes an excellent move. denotes dubious move and. denotes an interesting risky move. In some chess variants such as large-board Shogi variants. is used to record pieces capturing by stationary feeding or burning. Scrabble In Scrabble an exclamation mark written after word is used to indicate its presence in the Official Tournament and Club Word List but its absence from the Official Scrabble Players Dictionary usually because the word has been judged offensive. Baseball Exclamation points or asterisks can be used on scorecards to denote great defensive play. Popular music The band. . pronounced Chk Chk Chk uses exclamation points as its name.In 2008 the pop-punk band Panic. at the Disco dropped the exclamation point in its name this became the most-discussed topic on fan message boards around the world. In 2009 the exclamation mark was re-inserted following the band 's split.The band Bomb the Music Industry. utilizes an exclamation mark in its name as well as several album and song titles and promotional material. Examples include their songs Shut Up The Punx. and the album Adults. Smart. Shithammered. And Excited by Nothing. American musician Pink stylizes her stage name NK and uses three exclamation points in the subtitle of her 2010 release Greatest Hits .... So Far. Television The exclamation mark was included in the title of Dinah Shore 's TV series Dinah. The exclamation mark was later the subject of bitter argument between Elaine Benes and her boyfriend Jake Jarmel in the Seinfeld episode The Sniffing Accountant. Elaine got upset with Jake for not putting an exclamation mark at the end of message about her friend having baby. Jake took extreme exception to the trivial criticism and broke up with Elaine putting an exclamation mark after his parting words 'm leaving. Theatre In musicals an exclamation mark is usually used when the title of the show has the same title of song within the act. Examples of this are shows like Oklahoma. and Mamma Mia.

"They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!",They 're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa. is 1966 novelty record written and performed by Jerry Samuels billed as Napoleon XIV and released on Warner Bros. Records.

Records. The song became an instant success in the United States peaking at No. on the Billboard Hot 100 popular music singles chart on August 13 No. on the Cash Box Top 100 charts No. in Canada and No. on the UK Singles Chart. Lyrics The lyrics consist of man describing his descent into madness after ostensibly being abandoned by his girlfriend and his impending committal to funny farm slang for mental hospital. It is revealed in the third and final verse that he is not being driven insane by the loss of woman but by runaway dog They 'll find you yet and when they do they 'll put you in the ASPCA you mangy mutt. According to Samuels he was concerned the record could be seen as making fun of the mentally ill and intentionally added that line so you realize that the person is talking about dog having left him not human. Said Samuels felt it would cause some people to say 'Well it 's alright. And it did. It worked. Song structure and technical background The song is driven by snare drum bass drum tambourine and hand clap rhythm. The vocal is spoken rhythmically rather than sung melodically while the vocal pitch rises and falls at key points to create an unusual glissando effect augmented by the sound of wailing sirens.According to Samuels the vocal pitch shift was achieved by manipulating the recording speed of his vocal track multitrack variation on the technique used by Ross Bagdasarian in creating the original Chipmunks novelty songs. At the time the song was written Samuels was working as recording engineer at Associated Recording Studios in New York. Samuels used Variable Frequency Oscillator to alter the 60 Hz frequency of the hysteresis motor of multitrack tape recording machine. He first recorded the rhythm track then overdubbed the vocal track while slowing the tape at the end of each chorus and reciting the words in time with the slowing beat so when it was played back at normal speed the tempo would be steady but the pitch of his voice would rise. He came up the idea for song inspired by the rhythm of the old Scottish tune The Campbells Are Coming. Some tracks were treated with intermittent tape-based echo effects created by an Echoplex. Samuels also layered in siren effects that gradually rose and fell with the pitch of his vocals. B-side Continuing the theme of insanity the flip or B-side of the single was simply the A-side played in reverse and given the title aaaH-aH yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT or Ha-Haaa. Away Me Take to Coming They 're and the performer billed as XIV NAPOLEON. Most of the label affixed to the B-side was mirror image of the front label as opposed to simply being spelled backward including the letters in the WB shield logo. Only the label name disclaimer and record and recording master numbers were kept frontward. The reverse version of the song is not included on the original Warner Bros. album although the title is shown on the front cover where the title is actually spelled backward.In his Book of Rock Lists rock music critic Dave Marsh calls the B-side the most obnoxious song ever to appear in jukebox saying the recording once cleared out diner of forty patrons in two minutes flat. Airplay The song charted at No. on the Billboard Hot 100 charts on August 13 No. on the Cash Box Top 100 charts on July 30 No. in Canada and No. on the UK Singles Chart.Warner Bros. Records reissued the original single 7726 in 1973. It entered the Billboard Hot 100 at No. 87 but stalled at No. 101 at the Week Ahead charts which was an addition to the Cash Box Top 100 charts. The reissue featured the Burbank/palm trees label. As with the original release the labels for the reissue 's B-side also included mirror-imaged print except for the disclaimer record catalog and track master numbers. The Burbank motto at the top of the label was also kept frontward as well as the WB letters in the shield logo which had been printed in reverse on the originals. Chart history Sequels 'm Happy They Took You Away Ha-Haaa. was recorded by CBS Radio Mystery Theater cast member Bryna Raeburn credited as Josephine XV and was the closing track on Side Two of the 1966 Warner Bros. album. Josephine was the name of the spouse of the French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte. In 1966 They Took You Away 'm Glad 'm Glad appeared on These Are the Hits You Silly Savages by Teddy Darrel.A variation of They 're Coming to Take Me Away Ha-Haaa. was also done by Jerry Samuels from that same album entitled Where the Nuts hunt the Squirrels where Samuels towards the end of the track repeats the line THEY 'RE TRYING TO DRIVE ME SANE. HA HA before the song 's fade in fast-tracked higher voice.In 1966 KRLA DJ Emperor Bob Hudson recorded similarly styled song titled 'm Normal including the lines They came and took my brother away/The men in white picked him up yesterday/But they 'll never come take me away 'cos 'm O.K./I 'm normal. Another line in the song was eat my peas with tuning fork. The record was credited simply to The Emperor .In 1988 Samuels wrote and recorded They 're Coming To Get Me Again Ha Haaa. sequel to the original record. It was included on single two years later on the Collectables label. It never charted and was combined with the original 1966 recording on side. Both sequels are included on Samuels 1996 Second Coming album. In the song the singer has been released from the mental hospital although he is not completely cured of his insanity and grows paranoid that he will be re-institutionalized. Toward the end of the song he relapses into the funny farm and happy home —until when reality sinks in he cries out at fast tracked double voice with the words OH NO. before the beat ends with door slam indicating that he has been locked up in the insane asylum.The recording appeared on disk releases by Dr. Demento in 1975 as part of Dr. Demento 's Delights then in subsequent Dr. Demento LP records released in 1985 1988 and 1991. Cover versions Many cover versions of the song were recorded following the song 's release in 1966. Kim Fowley released cover of the song as his second single after The Trip. References.

In 2009 survey of 3,000 Venezuelans indicated that 61 of citizens watched or listened to the show regularly.The show was powerful tool in promoting Chavista socialist ideals and achievements of the Bolivarian Revolution to supporters in Venezuela and beyond. Many editions were filmed outdoors before large audiences commonly featuring local farm factory school hospital housing project or other public investment. Although Chávez typically appeared on television several times week Aló Presidente was his opportunity to reach most families on their day off. It has also been broadcast when Chávez has been abroad including in Guatemala Cuba Dominican Republic Brazil and Argentina.The show was criticized for its apparent lack of seriousness due to low production values spontaneous announcements random contributions from audience members colorful informality and often outright tedium.

Live footage of Aló Presidente would occasionally be broadcast simultaneously across all state and private TV and radio in Venezuela for any period determined by Chávez during the broadcast. History Beginning in 1999 Aló Presidente was 1-hour show designed to give citizens voice and put them in direct contact with Chávez. The first broadcast was made on May 23 1999 about three months after Chávez took office on radio. The show did not air between June 2011 and January 2012 while Chávez was receiving cancer treatment in Cuba. total of 378 shows aired.In 2007 Chávez took his desk to the beach and recorded 7-hour episode including his views on what he called European imperialism in the Malvinas. During the March 2008 airing Chávez ordered top general to send ten battalions of troops to the border with Colombia in response to bombing by Colombian forces inside Ecuador which killed Raúl Reyes FARC leader. The battalions were ultimately not deployed but the declaration may have caused the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis. Chávez spent large amount of time on the show denouncing capitalism imperialism and foreign interference.When segments were broadcast as cadena nacional citizens were compelled to either listen in or turn off their TVs or radios. Many Venezuelans tuned in because Chávez was known for unveiling financial assistance packages or other social benefits. The show promoted the Bolivarian Revolution and allied governments blaming Venezuela 's economic and other problems principally on the United States but also internal economic and political enemies. George W. Bush was referred to as Míster Danger the villain character in famous Venezuelan novel Doña Bárbara. Format The format of the show changed over time. At first it was mainly call-in show in which Venezuelans expressed grievances and discussed politics with Chávez. Over time Chávez became the attraction serving as teacher interrogator entertainer and motivator. The show 's content broadened to topics as diverse as geography history philosophy and pedagogy. Musical performances became common as the years went on. Chávez usually broadcast from new location each week.Government ministers were often required to attend in person. They could be questioned by the president about anything and sometimes policy even military policy was apparently decided live on the show. Another topic the show frequently used to discuss was U.S. foreign policy. Once the show sent an interviewer out into the streets stopping passers-by at random to ask if they watched the show without fail they all said they did. Style Rachel Nolan of The New York Times described the show as looking for all the world like 'Daily Show parody because of its cheap and quirky opening titles ribbon in the colors of the Venezuelan flag unfurls with drum roll before the title appears on screen followed by trumpet call with dramatic block letters showing the words humanity struggle and socialism. Nolan also notes the political imagery of Chávez appearance in the title sequences he was commonly dressed in bold red shirt or in military uniform often wearing Che Guevara beret and being swarmed by supporters.Chávez also had catchphrase on the show akin to Donald Trump 's You 're Fired. common activity Chávez was filmed doing for the show was expropriating property owned by rich people which he dramatized by pointing at the building and shouting ¡Exprópiese. Influence Aló Presidente spawned similar programs by leaders in other Latin American countries including Bolivia Ecuador and El Salvador led by Presidents Evo Morales Rafael Correa and Mauricio Funes respectively. Some of these leaders had previously been featured on Aló Presidente. later similar program created by Paraguayan President Mario Abdo Benítez in September 2019 was delivered via WhatsApp. Despite the international copies Nolan opined that with the exception of the logorrheic Fidel Castro it 's hard to imagine another political figure with the combination of manic exhibitionism and entertainer 's stamina required to star in this sort of show .It was suggested by historian Enrique Krauze that the show was somewhat enjoyed by Venezuelans because it gave them at least the appearance of contact with power through Chávez verbal and visual presence which may be welcomed by people who have spent most of their lives being ignored.

James Keast served as editor in chief until 2020.

Panhole,panhole is depression or basin eroded into flat or gently sloping cohesive rock. Similar terms for this feature are gnamma or rock holes Australia armchair hollows weathering pans or pits and solution pans or pits .Some authors refer to panholes also as potholes which is term typically used for similarly shaped riverine landforms. In fluvial geomorphology the term pothole is typically used for smooth bowl-shaped or cylindrical hollow generally deeper than wide found developed in the rocky bed of stream. This type of feature is created by the grinding action either of stone or stones or of coarse sediment whirled around and kept in motion by eddies or the force of the stream current in given spot.,panhole is depression or basin eroded into flat or gently sloping cohesive rock.

This type of feature is created by the grinding action either of stone or stones or of coarse sediment whirled around and kept in motion by eddies or the force of the stream current in given spot. Description of panholes Panholes are erosional or destructional features that are developed in variety of climatic environments and in wide range of rock types. These shallow basins or closed depressions are quite commonly well developed in surfaces of granitic rocks and sandstone. They are generally characterized by flat bottoms and sometimes by overhanging sides. The initial form may be closed hollow created by patch of humus. Diameters are rarely greater than ft 1.8. Some panholes were at one time thought to be man-made because their roundness was so perfect they were argued not be natural and must have been shaped by humans.Panholes are most commonly found in desert environments such as the Colorado Plateau. few well-known panholes are found developed in sandstone surfaces in Canyonlands National Park Capitol Reef National Park and Moab. Panholes are capable of collecting water when it rains freezing over when the weather gets cold dry out in hotter weather and can even contain some species of bacteria lichens mosses and blue-green algae. Panholes range in size from few centimeters to many meters in diameter. The cavities can be shallow or more than 15 meters 49 ft deep containing hundreds of liters of water. The Australian Aboriginal term gnamma in particular implies depression capable of holding water in arid areas forming an important water resource for Aboriginal people that needed to be carefully maintained.Within the potholes is varied eco-system that contains bacteria such as cyanobacteria fungi and algae which can be referred as biofilm. Potholes do not contain predators like fish or aquatic insect. The biofilm breaks down some of the siliceous minerals in the pothole for nutrients resulting in furthering the weathering the pothole. The organisms that live in the potholes have to tolerate rapid change in water temperature pH oxygen carbon dioxide concentration and ion concentration. Origin of panholes In the Sierra Nevada California these features were termed weathering pits by François E. Matthes where they are thought to indicate rock surfaces that are unglaciated or escaped more recent glaciations. In Sierra Nevada granitic rocks these features have characteristic shape such that they expand more rapidly in width than they grow in depth. One explanation for their conformation is because the most active environment for weathering is the zone of alternate wetting and drying along the margins of the pools that collect in the pits the margins tend to deepen and enlarge until all points of the bottom are equally wet or dry at the same time thus producing their characteristic shape. Potholes can expand from weathering and erosion but the main activity of how potholes expand is from biological weathering. At one time the belief was that the only agents involved with the expansion of potholes were physical weathering. Terminology Australia In Australia the terms gnamma and rock hole or rockhole are used. Gnamma is an anglicization of Nyoongar language word used by that Aboriginal people of Western Australia to describe naturally formed rock hole as well as its retained rainwater. The term gnamma hole is also widely used but is incorrect being tautology.

This separation can improve content accessibility provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting. Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods such as on-screen in print by voice via speech-based browser or screen reader and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on mobile device.The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches particular element. This cascading priority scheme is predictable. The CSS specifications are maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium W3C. Internet media type MIME type text/css is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318 March 1998. The W3C operates free CSS validation service for CSS documents.In addition to HTML other markup languages support the use of CSS including XHTML plain XML SVG and XUL. Syntax CSS has simple syntax and uses number of English keywords to specify the names of various style properties. style sheet consists of list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors and declaration block. Selector In CSS selectors declare which part of the markup style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself. Selectors may apply to the following all elements of specific type e.g. the second-level headers h2 elements specified by attribute in particular id an identifier unique within the document denoted in the selector language by hash prefix e.g. id class an identifier that can annotate multiple elements in document denoted by dot prefix e.g. .classname the phrase CSS class although sometimes used is misnomer as element classes—specified with the HTML class attribute—is markup feature that is distinct from browsers CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standards work on document styles see RDF and microformats for the origins of the class system of the Web content model elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.Classes and IDs are case-sensitive start with letters and can include alphanumeric characters hyphens and underscores. class may apply to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to single element. Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree. One example of widely used pseudo-class is hover which identifies content only when the user points to the visible element usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to selector as in hover or elementid hover. pseudo-class classifies document elements such as link or visited whereas pseudo-element makes selection that may consist of partial elements such as :first-line or :first-letter. Note the double-colon notation for pseudo-elements versus single-colon notation for pseudo-class. Selectors may be combined in many ways to achieve great specificity and flexibility. Multiple selectors may be joined in spaced list to specify elements by location element type id class or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example div .myClass color red applies to all elements of class myClass that are inside div elements whereas .myClass div color red applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass color red which applies to div elements of class myClass. The following table provides summary of selector syntax indicating usage and the version of CSS that introduced it. Declaration block declaration block consists of list of declarations in braces. Each declaration itself consists of property colon and value. If there are multiple declarations in block semi-colon must be inserted to separate each declaration. An optional semi-colon after the last or single declaration may be used.Properties are specified in the CSS standard. Each property has set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of element and others apply only to particular groups of elements.Values may be keywords such as center or inherit or numerical values such as 200px 200 pixels 50vw 50 percent of the viewport width or 80 80 percent of the parent element 's width. Color values can be specified with keywords e.g. red hexadecimal values e.g. FF0000 also abbreviated as F00 RGB values on to 255 scale e.g. rgb 255 RGBA values that specify both color and alpha transparency e.g. rgba 255 0.8 or HSL or HSLA values e.g. hsl 000 100 50 hsla 000 100 50 80. ==== Length units ==== Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include length unit which is either an alphabetic code or abbreviation as in 200px or 50vw or percentage sign as in 80. Some units cm centimetre in inch mm millimetre pc pica and pt point are absolute which means that the rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page others em em ex ex and px pixel are relative which means that factors such as the font size of parent element can affect the rendered measurement. These eight units were feature of CSS and retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level will if adopted as W3C Recommendation provide seven further length units ch rem vh vmax vmin and vw. Use Before CSS nearly all presentational attributes of HTML documents were contained within the HTML markup. All font colors background styles element alignments borders and sizes had to be explicitly described often repeatedly within the HTML. CSS lets authors move much of that information to another file the style sheet resulting in considerably simpler HTML. For example headings h1 elements sub-headings h2 sub-sub-headings h3 etc. are defined structurally using HTML. In print and on the screen choice of font size color and emphasis for these elements is presentational. Before CSS document authors who wanted to assign such typographic characteristics to say all h2 headings had to repeat HTML presentational markup for each occurrence of that heading type. This made documents more complex larger and more error-prone and difficult to maintain. CSS allows the separation of presentation from structure. CSS can define color font text alignment size borders spacing layout and many other typographic characteristics and can do so independently for on-screen and printed views. CSS also defines non-visual styles such as reading speed and emphasis for aural text readers. The W3C has now deprecated the use of all presentational HTML markup.For example under pre-CSS HTML heading element defined with red text would be written as Using CSS the same element can be coded using style properties instead of HTML presentational attributes The advantages of this may not be immediately clear but the power of CSS becomes more apparent when the style properties are placed in an internal style element or even better an external CSS file. For example suppose the document contains the style element All h1 elements in the document will then automatically become red without requiring any explicit code. If the author later wanted to make h1 elements blue instead this could be done by changing the style element to rather than by laboriously going through the document and changing the color for each individual h1 element. The styles can also be placed in an external CSS file as described below and loaded using syntax similar to This further decouples the styling from the HTML document and makes it possible to restyle multiple documents by simply editing shared external CSS file. Sources CSS information can be provided from various sources. These sources can be the web browser the user and the author. The information from the author can be further classified into inline media type importance selector specificity rule order inheritance and property definition. CSS style information can be in separate document or it can be embedded into an HTML document. Multiple style sheets can be imported. Different styles can be applied depending on the output device being used for example the screen version can be quite different from the printed version so authors can tailor the presentation appropriately for each medium. The style sheet with the highest priority controls the content display. Declarations not set in the highest priority source are passed on to source of lower priority such as the user agent style. The process is called cascading. One of the goals of CSS is to allow users greater control over presentation. Someone who finds red italic headings difficult to read may apply different style sheet. Depending on the browser and the website user may choose from various style sheets provided by the designers or may remove all added styles and view the site using the browser 's default styling or may override just the red italic heading style without altering other attributes. Browser extensions like Stylish and Stylus have been created to facilitate the management of such user style sheets. Specificity Specificity refers to the relative weights of various rules. It determines which styles apply to an element when more than one rule could apply. Based on the specification simple selector e.g. H1 has specificity of class selectors have specificity of 1,0 and ID selectors have specificity of 1,0,0. Because the specificity values do not carry over as in the decimal system commas are used to separate the digits CSS rule having 11 elements and 11 classes would have specificity of 11,11 not 121. Thus the selectors of the following rule result in the indicated specificity ==== Examples ==== Consider this HTML fragment In the above example the declaration in the style attribute overrides the one in the style element because it has higher specificity and thus the paragraph appears green Inheritance Inheritance is key feature in CSS it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanism by which properties are applied not only to specified element but also to its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree which is the hierarchy of XHTML elements in page based on nesting. Descendant elements may inherit CSS property values from any ancestor element enclosing them. In general descendant elements inherit text-related properties but their box-related properties are not inherited. Properties that can be inherited are color font letter spacing line-height list-style text-align text-indent text-transform visibility white-space and word-spacing. Properties that can not be inherited are background border display float and clear height and width margin min- and max-height and -width outline overflow padding position text-decoration vertical-align and z-index. Inheritance can be used to avoid declaring certain properties over and over again in style sheet allowing for shorter CSS. Inheritance in CSS is not the same as inheritance in class-based programming languages where it is possible to define class as like class but with modifications. With CSS it is possible to style an element with class but with modifications. However it is not possible to define CSS class like that which could then be used to style multiple elements without having to repeat the modifications. ==== Example ==== Given the following style sheet Suppose there is element with an emphasizing element em inside If no color is assigned to the em element the emphasized word illustrate inherits the color of the parent element p. The style sheet has the color pink hence the em element is likewise pink Whitespace The whitespace between properties and selectors is ignored. This code snippet is functionally equivalent to this one One common way to format CSS for readability is to indent each property and give it its own line. In addition to formatting CSS for readability shorthand properties can be used to write out the code faster which also gets processed more quickly when being rendered Sometimes multiple property values are indented onto their own line Positioning CSS 2.1 defines three positioning schemes Normal flow Inline items are laid out in the same way as the letters in words in the text one after the other across the available space until there is no more room then starting new line below. Block items stack vertically like paragraphs and like the items in bulleted list. Normal flow also includes the relative positioning of block or inline items and run-in boxes. Floats floated item is taken out of the normal flow and shifted to the left or right as far as possible in the space available. Other content then flows alongside the floated item. Absolute positioning An absolutely positioned item has no place in and no effect on the normal flow of other items. It occupies its assigned position in its container independently of other items. ==== Position property ==== There are five possible values of the position property. If an item is positioned in any way other than static then the further properties top bottom left and right are used to specify offsets and positions.The element having position static is not affected by the top bottom left or right properties. Static The default value places the item in the normal flow Relative The item is placed in the normal flow and then shifted or offset from that position. Subsequent flow items are laid out as if the item had not been moved. Absolute Specifies absolute positioning. The element is positioned in relation to its nearest non-static ancestor. Fixed The item is absolutely positioned in fixed position on the screen even as the rest of the document is scrolled ==== Float and clear ==== The float property may have one of three values. Absolutely positioned or fixed items can not be floated. Other elements normally flow around floated items unless they are prevented from doing so by their clear property. left The item floats to the left of the line that it would have appeared in other items may flow around its right side. right The item floats to the right of the line that it would have appeared in other items may flow around its left side. clear Forces the element to appear underneath 'clear floated elements to the left clear left right clear right or both sides clear both. History CSS was first proposed by Håkon Wium Lie on 10 October 1994. At the time Lie was working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for the web were proposed around the same time and discussions on public mailing lists and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation CSS1 being released in 1996. In particular proposal by Bert Bos was influential he became co-author of CSS1 and is regarded as co-creator of CSS.Style sheets have existed in one form or another since the beginnings of Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML in the 1980s and CSS was developed to provide style sheets for the web. One requirement for web style sheet language was for style sheets to come from different sources on the web. Therefore existing style sheet languages like DSSSL and FOSI were not suitable. CSS on the other hand let document 's style be influenced by multiple style sheets by way of cascading styles.As HTML grew it came to encompass wider variety of stylistic capabilities to meet the demands of web developers. This evolution gave the designer more control over site appearance at the cost of more complex HTML. Variations in web browser implementations such as ViolaWWW and WorldWideWeb made consistent site appearance difficult and users had less control over how web content was displayed. The browser/editor developed by Tim Berners-Lee had style sheets that were hard-coded into the program. The style sheets could therefore not be linked to documents on the web. Robert Cailliau also of CERN wanted to separate the structure from the presentation so that different style sheets could describe different presentation for printing screen-based presentations and editors.Improving web presentation capabilities was topic of interest to many in the web community and nine different style sheet languages were proposed on the www-style mailing list. Of these nine proposals two were especially influential on what became CSS Cascading HTML Style Sheets and Stream-based Style Sheet Proposal SSP. Two browsers served as testbeds for the initial proposals Lie worked with Yves Lafon to implement CSS in Dave Raggett 's Arena browser. Bert Bos implemented his own SSP proposal in the Argo browser. Thereafter Lie and Bos worked together to develop the CSS standard the was removed from the name because these style sheets could also be applied to other markup languages besides HTML .Lie 's proposal was presented at the Mosaic and the Web conference later called WWW2 in Chicago Illinois in 1994 and again with Bert Bos in 1995. Around this time the W3C was already being established and took an interest in the development of CSS. It organized workshop toward that end chaired by Steven Pemberton. This resulted in W3C adding work on CSS to the deliverables of the HTML editorial review board ERB. Lie and Bos were the primary technical staff on this aspect of the project with additional members including Thomas Reardon of Microsoft participating as well. In August 1996 Netscape Communication Corporation presented an alternative style sheet language called JavaScript Style Sheets JSSS. The spec was never finished and is deprecated. By the end of 1996 CSS was ready to become official and the CSS level Recommendation was published in December. Development of HTML CSS and the DOM had all been taking place in one group the HTML Editorial Review Board ERB. Early in 1997 the ERB was split into three working groups HTML Working group chaired by Dan Connolly of W3C DOM Working group chaired by Lauren Wood of SoftQuad and CSS Working group chaired by Chris Lilley of W3C. The CSS Working Group began tackling issues that had not been addressed with CSS level resulting in the creation of CSS level on November 1997. It was published as W3C Recommendation on May 12 1998. CSS level which was started in 1998 is still under development as of 2014. In 2005 the CSS Working Groups decided to enforce the requirements for standards more strictly. This meant that already published standards like CSS 2.1 CSS Selectors and CSS Text were pulled back from Candidate Recommendation to Working Draft level. Difficulty with adoption The CSS specification was completed in 1996. Microsoft 's Internet Explorer was released that year featuring some limited support for CSS. IE and Netscape 4.x added more support but it was typically incomplete and had many bugs that prevented CSS from being usefully adopted. It was more than three years before any web browser achieved near-full implementation of the specification. Internet Explorer 5.0 for the Macintosh shipped in March 2000 was the first browser to have full better than 99 percent CSS support surpassing Opera which had been the leader since its introduction of CSS support fifteen months earlier. Other browsers followed soon afterward and many of them additionally implemented parts of CSS 2.However even when later version web browsers began to offer fairly full implementation of CSS they were still incorrect in certain areas. They were fraught with inconsistencies bugs and other quirks. Microsoft Internet Explorer 5. for Windows as opposed to the very different IE for Macintosh had flawed implementation of the CSS box model as compared with the CSS standards. Such inconsistencies and variation in feature support made it difficult for designers to achieve consistent appearance across browsers and platforms without the use of workarounds termed CSS hacks and filters. The IE Windows box model bugs were so serious that when Internet Explorer was released Microsoft introduced backward-compatible mode of CSS interpretation quirks mode alongside an alternative corrected standards mode. Other non-Microsoft browsers also provided mode-switch capabilities. It therefore became necessary for authors of HTML files to ensure they contained special distinctive standards-compliant CSS intended marker to show that the authors intended CSS to be interpreted correctly in compliance with standards as opposed to being intended for the now long-obsolete IE5/Windows browser. Without this marker web browsers with the quirks mode -switching capability will size objects in web pages as IE on Windows would rather than following CSS standards.Problems with the patchy adoption of CSS and errata in the original specification led the W3C to revise the CSS standards into CSS 2.1 which moved nearer to working snapshot of current CSS support in HTML browsers. Some CSS properties that no browser successfully implemented were dropped and in few cases defined behaviors were changed to bring the standard into line with the predominant existing implementations. CSS 2.1 became Candidate Recommendation on February 25 2004 but CSS 2.1 was pulled back to Working Draft status on June 13 2005 and only returned to Candidate Recommendation status on July 19 2007.In addition to these problems the .css extension was used by software product used to convert PowerPoint files into Compact Slide Show files so some web servers served all .css as MIME type application/x-pointplus rather than text/css. Vendor prefixes Individual browser vendors occasionally introduced new parameters ahead of standardization and universalization. To prevent interfering with future implementations vendors prepended unique names to the parameters such as -moz- for Mozilla Firefox -webkit- named after the browsing engine of Apple Safari -o- for Opera Browser and -ms- for Microsoft Internet Explorer and early versions of Microsoft Edge that use EdgeHTML. Occasionally the parameters with vendor prefixes such as -moz-radial-gradient and -webkit-linear-gradient have slightly different syntax as compared to their non-vendor-prefix counterparts.Prefixed properties are rendered obsolete by the time of standardization. Programs are available to automatically add prefixes for older browsers and to point out standardized versions of prefixed parameters. Since prefixes are limited to small subset of browsers removing the prefix allows other browsers to see the functionality. An exception is certain obsolete -webkit- prefixed properties which are so common and persistent on the web that other families of browsers have decided to support them for compatibility. Variations CSS has various levels and profiles. Each level of CSS builds upon the last typically adding new features and typically denoted as CSS CSS CSS and CSS. Profiles are typically subset of one or more levels of CSS built for particular device or user interface. Currently there are profiles for mobile devices printers and television sets. Profiles should not be confused with media types which were added in CSS. ==== CSS ==== The first CSS specification to become an official W3C Recommendation is CSS level published on 17 December 1996. Håkon Wium Lie and Bert Bos are credited as the original developers. Among its capabilities are support for Font properties such as typeface and emphasis Color of text backgrounds and other elements Text attributes such as spacing between words letters and lines of text Alignment of text images tables and other elements Margin border padding and positioning for most elements Unique identification and generic classification of groups of attributesThe W3C no longer maintains the CSS Recommendation. ==== CSS ==== CSS level specification was developed by the W3C and published as recommendation in May 1998. superset of CSS CSS includes number of new capabilities like absolute relative and fixed positioning of elements and z-index the concept of media types support for aural style sheets which were later replaced by the CSS speech modules and bidirectional text and new font properties such as shadows. The W3C no longer maintains the CSS recommendation. ==== CSS 2.1 ==== CSS level revision often referred to as CSS 2.1 fixes errors in CSS removes poorly supported or not fully interoperable features and adds already implemented browser extensions to the specification. To comply with the W3C Process for standardizing technical specifications CSS 2.1 went back and forth between Working Draft status and Candidate Recommendation status for many years. CSS 2.1 first became Candidate Recommendation on 25 February 2004 but it was reverted to Working Draft on 13 June 2005 for further review. It returned to Candidate Recommendation on 19 July 2007 and then updated twice in 2009. However because changes and clarifications were made it again went back to Last Call Working Draft on December 2010. CSS 2.1 went to Proposed Recommendation on 12 April 2011. After being reviewed by the W3C Advisory Committee it was finally published as W3C Recommendation on June 2011.CSS 2.1 was planned as the first and final revision of level 2—but low-priority work on CSS 2.2 began in 2015. ==== CSS ==== Unlike CSS which is large single specification defining various features CSS is divided into several separate documents called modules. Each module adds new capabilities or extends features defined in CSS preserving backward compatibility. Work on CSS level started around the time of publication of the original CSS recommendation. The earliest CSS drafts were published in June 1999.Due to the modularization different modules have different stability and statuses.Some modules have Candidate Recommendation CR status and are considered moderately stable. At CR stage implementations are advised to drop vendor prefixes. ==== CSS ==== There is no single integrated CSS4 specification because the specification has been split into many separate modules which level independently. Modules that build on things from CSS Level started at Level. Some of them have already reached Level or are already approaching Level. Other modules that define entirely new functionality such as Flexbox have been designated as Level and some of them are approaching Level. The CSS Working Group sometimes publishes Snapshots collection of whole modules and parts of other drafts that are considered stable enough to be implemented by browser developers. So far five such best current practices documents have been published as Notes in 2007 2010 2015 2017 and 2018.Since these specification snapshots are primarily intended for developers there has been growing demand for similar versioned reference document targeted at authors which would present the state of interoperable implementations as meanwhile documented by sites like Can Use ... and the MDN Web Docs. W3C Community Group has been established in early 2020 in order to discuss and define such resource. The actual kind of versioning is also up to debate which means that the document once produced might not be called CSS4. Browser support Each web browser uses layout engine to render web pages and support for CSS functionality is not consistent between them. Because browsers do not parse CSS perfectly multiple coding techniques have been developed to target specific browsers with workarounds commonly known as CSS hacks or CSS filters. The adoption of new functionality in CSS can be hindered by lack of support in major browsers. For example Internet Explorer was slow to add support for many CSS features which slowed the adoption of those features and damaged the browser 's reputation among developers. Additionally proprietary syntax for the non-vendor-prefixed filter property was used in some versions. In order to ensure consistent experience for their users web developers often test their sites across multiple operating systems browsers and browser versions increasing development time and complexity. Tools such as BrowserStack have been built to reduce the complexity of maintaining these environments. In addition to these testing tools many sites maintain lists of browser support for specific CSS properties including CanIUse and the MDN Web Docs. Additionally CSS defines feature queries which provide an supports directive that will allow developers to target browsers with support for certain functionality directly within their CSS. CSS that is not supported by older browsers can also sometimes be patched in using JavaScript polyfills which are pieces of JavaScript code designed to make browsers behave consistently. These workarounds—and the need to support fallback functionality—can add complexity to development projects and consequently companies frequently define list of browser versions that they will and will not support. As websites adopt newer code standards that are incompatible with older browsers these browsers can be cut off from accessing many of the resources on the web sometimes intentionally. Many of the most popular sites on the internet are not just visually degraded on older browsers due to poor CSS support but do not work at all in large part due to the evolution of JavaScript and other web technologies. Limitations Some noted limitations of the current capabilities of CSS include Can not explicitly declare new scope independently of position Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with position absolute or position relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. For example it is impossible to avoid declaring new scope when one is forced to adjust an element 's position preventing one from using the desired scope of parent element. Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class hover is dynamic equivalent of JavaScript onmouseover and has potential for misuse e.g. implementing cursor-proximity popups but CSS has no ability for client to disable it no disable -like property or limit its effects no nochange -like values for each property. Can not name rules There is no way to name CSS rule which would allow for example client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes. Can not include styles from rule into another rule CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to achieve the desired effect causing additional maintenance and requiring more thorough testing. Some new CSS features were proposed to solve this but were abandoned afterward. Instead authors may gain this ability by using more sophisticated stylesheet languages which compile to CSS such as Sass Less or Stylus. Can not target specific text without altering markup Besides the first-letter pseudo-element one can not target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize place-holder elements. Advantages Separation of content from presentation CSS facilitates the publication of content in multiple presentation formats based on nominal parameters. Nominal parameters include explicit user preferences different web browsers the type of device being used to view the content desktop computer or mobile device the geographic location of the user and many other variables. Site-wide consistency When CSS is used effectively in terms of inheritance and cascading global style sheet can be used to affect and style elements site-wide. If the situation arises that the styling of the elements should be changed or adjusted these changes can be made by editing rules in the global style sheet. Before CSS this sort of maintenance was more difficult expensive and time-consuming. Bandwidth stylesheet internal or external specifies the style once for range of HTML elements selected by class type or relationship to others. This is much more efficient than repeating style information inline for each occurrence of the element. An external stylesheet is usually stored in the browser cache and can therefore be used on multiple pages without being reloaded further reducing data transfer over network. Page reformatting With simple change of one line different style sheet can be used for the same page. This has advantages for accessibility as well as providing the ability to tailor page or site to different target devices. Furthermore devices not able to understand the styling still display the content. Accessibility Without CSS web designers must typically lay out their pages with techniques such as HTML tables that hinder accessibility for vision-impaired users see Tableless web design Accessibility. Standardization Frameworks CSS frameworks are pre-prepared libraries that are meant to allow for easier more standards-compliant styling of web pages using the Cascading Style Sheets language. CSS frameworks include Blueprint Bootstrap Foundation and Materialize. Like programming and scripting language libraries CSS frameworks are usually incorporated as external .css sheets referenced in the HTML head. They provide number of ready-made options for designing and laying out the web page. Although many of these frameworks have been published some authors use them mostly for rapid prototyping or for learning from and prefer to 'handcraft CSS that is appropriate to each published site without the design maintenance and download overhead of having many unused features in the site 's styling. Design methodologies As the size of CSS resources used in project increases development team often needs to decide on common design methodology to keep them organized. The goals are ease of development ease of collaboration during development and performance of the deployed stylesheets in the browser. Popular methodologies include OOCSS object-oriented CSS ACSS atomic CSS CSS organic Cascade Style Sheet SMACSS scalable and modular architecture for CSS and BEM block element modifier.

ǃKung people,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers.,The ǃKung are one of the San peoples who live mostly on the western edge of the Kalahari desert Ovamboland northern Namibia and southern Angola and Botswana. The names ǃKung ǃXun and Ju are variant words for 'people preferred by different ǃKung groups. This band level society used traditional methods of hunting and gathering for subsistence up until the 1970s. Today the great majority of ǃKung people live in the villages of Bantu pastoralists and European ranchers. Beliefs The ǃKung people of Southern Africa recognize Supreme Being ǃXu who is the Creator and Upholder of life. Like other African High Gods he also punishes man by means of the weather and the Otjimpolo-ǃKung know him as Erob who knows everything. They also have animistic and animatistic beliefs which means they believe in both personifications and impersonal forces. For example they recall culture hero named Prishiboro whose wife was an elephant. Prishiboro 's older brother tricked him into killing his wife and eating her flesh. Her herd tried to kill Prishiboro in revenge but his brother defeated them.Amongst the ǃKung there is strong belief in the existence of spirits of the dead llgauwasi who live immortally in the sky. The llgauwasi can come to the earth and interact with humans. There is no particular connection to personal ancestors but the ǃKung fear the llgauwasi pray to them for sympathy and mercy as well as call on them in anger.The ǃKung practice shamanism to communicate with the spirit world and to cure what they call Star Sickness. The communication with the spirit world is done by natural healer entering trance state and running through fire thereby chasing away bad spirits. Star Sickness is cured by laying hands on the diseased. Nisa ǃKung woman reported through anthropologist Marjorie Shostak that healer in training is given root to help induce trance. Nisa said drank it number of times and threw up again and again. Finally started to tremble. People rubbed my body as sat there feeling the effect getting stronger and stronger. ... Trance-medicine really hurts. As you begin to trance the n/um power to heal slowly heats inside you and pulls at you. It rises until it grabs your insides and takes your thoughts away. Healing rites Healing rites are primary part of the ǃKung culture. In the ǃKung state of mind having health is equivalent to having social harmony meaning that relationships within the group are stable and open between other people. Any ǃKung can become healer because it is status accessible to all but it is grand aspiration of many members because of its importance. Even though there is no restriction of the power nearly half the men and one-third of the women are acknowledged of having the power to heal but with the responsibility comes great pain and hardship. To become healer aspirants must become an apprentice and learn from older healers. Their training includes the older healer having to go into trance to teach the novices rubbing their own sweat onto the pupils centers their bellies backs foreheads and spines. Most of the apprentices have the intentions of becoming healer but then become frightened or have lack of ambition and discontinue. The ǃKung term for this powerful healing force is n/um. This force resides in the bellies of men and women who have gone through the training and have become healer. Healing can be transmitted through the ǃkia dance that begins at sundown and continues through the night. The ǃkia can be translated as trance which can give physical image of sleeping enchantment. While they dance in preparation for entering trance state to effect cure the substance the n/um heats up and boiling travels up the healer 's spine to explode with therapeutic power in the brain. While the healers are in the trance they propel themselves in journey to seek out the sickness and argue with the spirits. Women on the other hand have special medicine called the gwah which starts in the stomachs and kidneys. During the Drum Dance they enter the ǃkia state and the gwah travels up the spine and lodges in the neck. In order to obtain the gwah power the women chop up the root of short shrub boil it into tea and drink it. They do not need to drink the tea every time because the power they obtain lasts lifetime.The community of the ǃKung fully supports the healers and depends heavily on them. They have trust in the healers and the teachers to guide them psychologically and spiritually through life. The ǃKung have saying Healing makes their hearts happy and happy heart is one that reflects sense of community. Because of their longing to keep the peace between people their community is tranquil. Childbirth ǃKung women usually experience their first menstruation at the age of 16½ their first birth at 19½ and their last birth by their late 30s. ǃKung women often give birth unassisted walking away from the village camp as far as mile during labour and bearing the child alone delivering it into small leaf-lined hole dug into the warm sand. The child 's cord is not clamped or cut form of Lotus birth or umbilical nonseverance and the placenta is delivered and put next to the child as guardian. Shortly thereafter the baby-placenta is lightly covered with another large leaf and the new mother walks short way to verbally alert the older women of the completed birth at which time they join the mother and child in ritual welcoming. If laboring woman is delayed in returning to the village once she has left to give birth the older women will come looking for her to assist however it is said to be rare occurrence.Time between the births of children is traditionally about 3–5 years. Children are nursed for 3–5 years ending when the mother is pregnant with another child. This long period of time between children makes traveling long distances on foot like to gathering site or new settlement easier since fewer children require carrying and population numbers remain controlled.During times of deprivation infanticide was permitted to preserve resources. The ǃKung people do not use contraceptives and generally do not practice abstinence yet experience low fertility rates. Gender roles Traditionally especially among Juǀʼhoansi ǃKung women generally collect plant foods and water while men hunt. However these gender roles are not strict and people do all jobs as needed with little or no stigma. Women generally take care of children and prepare food. However this does restrict them to their homes since these activities are generally done with or close to others so women can socialize and help each other. Men are also engaged in these activities.Children are raised in village groups of other children of wide age range. Sexual activities amongst children are seen as natural play for both sexes.ǃKung women often share an intimate sociability and spend many hours together discussing their lives enjoying each other 's company and children. In the short documentary film Group of Women ǃKung women rest talk and nurse their babies while lying in the shade of baobab tree. This illustrates collective mothering where several women support each other and share the nurturing role. Marriage Marriage is the major focus of alliance formation between groups of ǃKung. When woman starts to develop she is considered ready for marriage. Every first marriage is arranged. The culture of the ǃKung is being directed at marriage itself rather than at specific man. Even though it does not matter who the man is the woman 's family is looking for specific type of man. The man should not be too much older than the woman should preferably be unmarried rather than divorced should be able to hunt and should be willing to take on the responsibilities of the wife 's family. The latter is because woman 's family depends heavily on her husband 's family particularly through trade when there are times of scarcity.On the marriage day the tradition is the marriage-by-capture ceremony in which the bride is forcibly removed from her hut and presented to her groom. During the ceremony the bride has her head covered and is carried and then laid down in the hut while the groom is led to the hut and sits beside the door. The couple stay respectfully apart from each other and do not join the wedding festivities. After the party is over they spend the night together and the next morning they are ceremonially rubbed with oil by the husband 's mother.Marriage is generally between man in his twenties and girl in her teens 14–18 years old. Newlyweds live in the same village as the wife 's family so she has family support during her new life. Often young wives return to their parents houses to sleep until they become comfortable with their husbands. During this time the husband will hunt for his wife 's family form of bridewealth. If the couple never becomes comfortable separation is acceptable prompted by either partner. If they do become stable couple they can reside with either partner 's family settling with whichever is beneficial at the time. Divorce remains possible throughout marriage. Extramarital sex is not condoned but is equally acceptable for each spouse. Domestic violence is prevented because villages are small and close and houses are open so that neighbors and relatives can intervene as needed. Divorce Girls who are displeased with their parents selection may violently protest against the marriage by kicking and screaming and running away at the end of the ceremony. After she has run away this may result in the dissolution of the arrangement.Half of all first-time marriages end in divorce but because it is common the divorce process is not long. Anthropologist Marjorie Shostak generalizes that Everyone in the village expresses point of view on the marriage and if the couple should be divorced or not. After the village weighs in they are divorced and can live in their separate huts with their family. Relations between divorced individuals are usually quite amicable with former partners living near one another and maintaining cordial relationship. After woman 's first divorce she is free to marry man of her choosing or stay single and live on her own. Social structure and hierarchy Unlike other complex food-foraging groups it is unusual for the ǃKung to have chieftain or headman in position of power over the other members. These San are not devoid of leadership but neither are they dependent on it. San groups of the Southern Kalahari have had chieftains in the past however there is somewhat complicated process to gain that position. Chieftainship within these San groups is not position with the greatest power as they have the same social status as those members of aged years. Becoming chieftain is mostly nominal though there are some responsibilities the chieftain assumes such as becoming the group 's logical head. This duty entails such roles as dividing up the meat from hunters kills these leaders do not receive larger portion than any other member of the village. The Kung people have given name to the Theory of Regal and Kungic Societal Structures due to their peacefulness and egalitarian social structure. Use of kinship terms Kinship is one of the central organizing principles for societies like the ǃKung. Richard Borshay Lee breaks ǃKung kinship principles down into three different sets Kinship Kinship II and Kinship III or wi. Kinship follows conventional kin terms father mother brother sister and is based on genealogical position. Kinship II applies to name relationships meaning that people who share the same name ǃkunǃa are treated as though they are kin of the same family and are assigned the same kinship term. This is common occurrence as there are limited number of ǃKung names. Kung names are also strictly gendered meaning that men and women can not share the same name. Names are passed down from ancestors according to strict set of rules though parents are never allowed to name their children after themselves.There is principle of alternating generations in terms of joking ai and avoidance kwa relations. One 's own generation and the second generation up and down are considered joking relations and are treated with relaxed affection. The first generations above and below one are avoidance relations and are treated in respectful and reserved manner. Every member of ǃKung society fits into one of these categories there are no neutral people.Kinship III or wi has to do with the principles of relative age status. In situations where there are two people trying to decide what kin terms to use the older person makes the ultimate decision. This is especially important in cultures like the ǃKung as there are not many status distinctions. Hunting rites Hunting can take days of tracking attacking and following wounded beast. The Juǀʼhoansi have rites to prevent arrogance amongst male hunters. When man kills beast he does not take it directly into the settlement but leaves the body and returns as if he was unsuccessful. An older man will inquire about his hunt and remark upon his failure to which the hunter must avoid credit and accept humility. The next day group will go see if some small animal was nicked by an arrow. Upon finding the quarry the hunter will be reassured of the little value of the kill which is finally returned. Additionally the kill may belong not to him but to the person who gave him arrows man or woman who then follows rules on how to distribute the meat to everyone in the group. Upon returning from successful hunt if the kill is transportable it will be brought back to the village. The ǃKung promote the belief of community well-being and so the village elders or those of mature years will allot meat to the members of the group. The ǃKung also believe in the betterment of their neighbors so if the kill is too large to move or there is surplus of meat word will be spread to villages that are close by to come collect meat for themselves. Language The ǃKung language commonly called Ju is one of the larger click languages and belongs to the Kxʼa language family loosely categorised in the Khoisan language group no longer seen as one family. The ǃKung people often communicate only by high-pitched clicks when sneaking up on prey in order to stay undetected. Recent history Since the 1950s the Juǀʼhoan population has increased. Cattle ranches have brought cows to their traditional lands. Cows eat the sparse vegetation which the Juǀʼhoansi and their game animals need as well as dirty the Juǀʼhoansi water holes. This water pollution along with the disappearance of native vegetation has made disease more prevalent.In addition to the problems involved in sharing water with cows the Juǀʼhoansi are less mobile than in the past. The current governments of Namibia and Botswana where the Juǀʼhoansi live encourage permanent settlements with European style houses. With urban employment and industrialization indigenous people are changing their nomadic lifestyle. European-descended settlers have encouraged wage-paid agricultural labour especially for men. Due to increased dependence on them and their access to wealth men are valued more. Women who traditionally prepared food have taken up the preparation of millet. Millet is more difficult to process than traditional Joǀʼhoan foods and therefore women must spend more time preparing food for their household leaving less time for employment outside the home. The changing gender roles growing inequality between the sexes and transformation from wandering hunter-gatherer life-style to life in village have contributed to more domestic violence as women are more dependent on men and increasingly restricted from outside intervention through changing housing styles and arrangements. Houses that are less open and the collection of wealth also challenges traditional sharing ideology.The ǃKung also face problems since their traditional lands are sought after by cattle ranchers wildlife reserves and state governments. In popular culture The protagonist in the film The Gods Must Be Crazy 1980 is caricature of ǃKung man. The American rock band Phish sometimes performs song called Kung during their live performances. Ivy Dickens talks about the ǃKung people in Season of Gossip Girl. Carl Sagan draws on the ǃKung 's way of life in relation to science in his 1995 book The Demon-Haunted World. He also referred to them in his 1994 lecture The Age of Exploration based primarily on anthropologist Richard Borshay Lee 's 1979 field study of the Kung San in the Botswanan part of the Kalahari Desert. 8:41–14:49 Sebastian Junger refers to one study in the 1960s that found that the ǃKung people only needed to work as little as 12 hours week to survive which is nearly one quarter the amount of time people need to work in modern society in his book Tribe.

Episodes of Impossible are also seen in the United States on the over-the-top internet television services Plex Xumo and The Roku Channel with each looping episodes 24 hours day on its own dedicated streaming channel.","Impossible stylised as mpossible is British television quiz show created by Hugh Rycroft and produced by Mighty Productions for BBC One. Hosted by Rick Edwards the show has maximum prize of £10,000 and features questions in which some answer choices are impossible or inconsistent with the given category. Episodes of Impossible are also seen in the United States on the over-the-top internet television services Plex Xumo and The Roku Channel with each looping episodes 24 hours day on its own dedicated streaming channel. Gameplay With the exception of Round see below all questions used on the show are multiple-choice with at least one answer each of three different types correct wrong and impossible. The impossible answers are distinguished by being inconsistent with the premise of the question. For example if the question were Seoul is the capital of which Asian country. the choices could be North Korea wrong its capital is Pyongyang South Korea correct West Korea impossible this country does not exist On each episode pool of contestants competes through two rounds until one is left to play for either the £10,000 jackpot or smaller daily prize pot built up during the course of the game. Contestants leave the show after playing the final once whether they win or not. With the exception of the last episode of each series players who fail to reach the final for any reason return on the next episode as long as they have not reached the end of their eligibility. The size of the pool and the contestants time on the show have occasionally changed. In the first series 30 contestants competed across all 15 episodes. The entire pool was replaced after every ten episodes in the second and third series and after every five from the fourth series onward. The pool was 24 contestants in the second through fourth series and 21 in the fifth. Also in the first series contestants left the game after they had reached the final twice rather than once as in all subsequent series the eighth series had 12 contestants instead of 21 due the coronavirus pandemic social distancing guidelines. During the first three series contestants who left the show were replaced by new ones to keep the pool at constant size. Starting with the fourth series though the departing contestant is not replaced leaving their seat empty. The Qualifier The Grid This round is played three times with each playing split into two halves qualifier and the grid to choose contestant for the final. The scores are set to zero at the beginning of each qualifier. In the qualifier the host asks five multiple-choice questions each with three answer options. Contestants secretly lock in their guesses and earn one point for each correct answer. Wrong answers leave the score unaffected but an impossible answer or failure to lock in response eliminates the contestant from the game. However if all remaining contestants are eliminated on single question the entire pool is brought back into play. After the fifth question the high scorer advances to the second half in the event of tie the contestant who locked in their answers in the shortest total time advances to play grid. For the grid the high scorer chooses one of four categories and is shown nine answers one correct three wrong five impossible. After hearing the first half of question they choose five answers they believe to be impossible each successful choice adds £100 to the daily prize pot and is removed from the board. The host then reads the second half of the question with all chosen non-impossible answers returned to play and the contestant must choose the correct answer in order to advance to the final. Choosing wrong answer gives the runner-up/last player who was eliminated from the first half chance to find the right answer and advance. However if this contestant chooses wrong or impossible answer the high scorer moves ahead. If any impossible answers remain on the board and the high scorer chooses one they are eliminated and the runner-up gets turn if they fail to choose the correct answer the host begins working down through the next-highest scorers until one of them does so. Categories are removed from the list of four as they are chosen leaving three options in the second playing and two in the third. The maximum daily prize pot is £1,500 accumulated by eliminating all five impossible answers in every playing of the grid. Contestants who advance to the final sit out all subsequent playings of the qualifier and grid. If qualifier begins with only one contestant left in the pool they must still give correct answer in order to advance to the grid. The Final The three remaining contestants compete directly against one another answering series of open-ended questions on the buzzer. Each is given 10 lives to start the round correct answer takes one life from both opponents while miss takes one from the contestant who buzzed-in. Some of the questions are themselves impossible e.g. In which decade of the 20th century was Pablo Picasso born. he was born in 1881 during the 19th century. Correctly identifying an impossible question costs both opponents two lives. However if contestant either tries to answer an impossible question or falsely identifies question as impossible they lose two lives. Contestants who lose all their lives are eliminated from the game the last one remaining advances to the £10,000 question. The £10,000 Question The last remaining contestant is asked one question in randomly chosen category and shown nine answers three each of correct wrong and impossible. The contestant has 10 seconds to choose three answers and wins the £10,000 jackpot if all three are correct. They win the daily prize pot if any of their choices are wrong but none are impossible and nothing at all if they choose an impossible answer. During the first series contestants who missed the question were asked second one under the same rules. This format was dropped at the start of the second series giving only one chance to win any money. The format was further altered in series in that the departing contestant was no longer replaced leaving that seat empty for subsequent episodes. The batch of contestants would also stay for week instead of two as in previous series. The jackpot is presented onstage as giant exclamation mark containing 10,000 £1 coins. When contestant wins it hatch in the bottom opens and the coins drain into hopper underneath. Impossible Celebrities On 20 February 2018 it was announced that Impossible would be launching primetime celebrity series which began to air in August that year. This version follows the same rules as the regular show with two changes The pool consists of 18 celebrities each playing for charity of their choice. If celebrity gives an impossible answer during the final the daily prize pot is cut in half and donated to their charity. Transmissions Regular editions Celebrity editions Merchandise The official Impossible app for iOS and Android was released by Barnstorm Games on 28 August 2019.

Acanthosicyos horridus,Acanthosicyos horridus is an unusual melon that is endemic to the Namib desert.

In English it is known as Nara butter-nuts or butterpips in one of the Khoisan languages it is locally called ǃnaras or ǃnara. is pronounced with click somewhat like the tsk when English people are tutting tsk-tsk. Description It is dioecious leafless phreatophyte meaning its roots penetrate deep down to water near the water table that is found in sandy deserts but not stony plains in areas with access to ground water such as ephemeral rivers and paleochannels where sand accumulating in the shelter of its stems can form hummocks up to 1000–1500 m2 in area and meters in height. Its stems may rise more than meter above the hummocks while its system of thick taproots can extend up to 50 downward. The plant is leafless so modified stems and spines 2–3 centimetres long serve as the photosynthetic organs of the plant. The plant can survive many years without water. Ecology Its sand-binding characteristics also help nara form microclimate within the desert dunes. These microclimates provide food and shelter for variety of vertebrates. Presence of the nara plant is associated with significantly increased soil microdiversity likely due to the shade it provides and the attraction of foraging mammals which contribute to organic matter.Acanthosicyos horridus typically occurs in the absence of other vegetation due to the harshness of the climate though Eragrostis spinosa and Stipagrostis sabulicola grasses may grow between its hummocks. It is regarded as keystone species because its melons seeds shoots and flowers are food sources for beetles gemsbok and ostrich while small rodents such as Rhabdomys pumilio Desmodillus auricularis and Thallomys nigricauda take shelter amid the spiny tangle of its stems. The katydid Acanthoproctus diadematus feeds on the plant moving between different bushes at night. Uses The melon fruits average kg and are pale green and spiny. Within it has sweet aromatic watery yellow-orange pulp. The large edible seeds white to cream in color are known as butter-nuts or butterpips. These have been exported for use in baked goods.The fruit serves as food source for Nama people from February to April and August to September.

In June 2014 Reisman said the company was headed into new phase selling much higher percentage of non-book items.In late 2017 it was announced that it would expand to the United States with its first location opening in The Mall at Short Hills in October 2018.In September 2022 Reisman stepped down as CEO and became executive chair with Peter Ruis being named CEO.In February 2023 Indigo was the victim of cyberattack that made them unable to process credit card transactions accept returns and process gift cards and rewards points. Their website remained unavailable for several days replaced by message explaining the situation. Operations The company sells books magazines gifts and toys through its website and in its stores. Its banners currently include Indigo Books Music Chapters Coles SmithBooks IndigoSpirit and The Book Company small format. Indigo began partnership with Apple and iUniverse publishing in the 2010s. Indigo also manufactures its own brand of products called IndigoLife. In addition the chain 's Indigo Trusted Advisor Program offers book recommendations from experts in health finance and the environment such as David Bach and David Suzuki. Charitable activities In 2004 Indigo started the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation program that helps provide new books and learning materials to high-needs elementary schools. Indigo commits 1.5 million annually to schools across Canada. The money is raised by Indigo itself customers staff suppliers and proceeds from Love of Reading fundraising products i.e. gift card sleeves. Only 80 of customer donations have been granted to over 1800 schools since the Love of Reading Foundation 's inception with Indigo covering all of the operating costs of the foundation. The funding given to the schools is split across 90 credit to spend at Indigo and 10 cash to be spent anywhere as long as it contributes to advancement of literacy.In addition to the regularly collected funds the annual Adopt School program has increased the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation 's donations up to total of CAD 26 million given to more than 3,000 school libraries in Canada since 2004. During the month-long Adopt School program each retail store selects local school to be the recipient of the donations the store collects during that time period.In 2007 the Indigo Love of Reading Foundation produced documentary chronicling the issue of funding for books in Canadian elementary schools. The documentary Writing on the Wall recounts the establishment of the foundation while revealing the current conditions of school libraries and literacy in Canada. follow up documentary was created in 2017 titled Read Between the Lines. Kobo Inc. Kobo Inc. an e-reader platform and manufacturer was founded and spun off of Indigo in November 2009. By August 2011 the Kobo e-reading platform had become the dominant player in Canada with research firm Ipsos Reid estimating that it represented 36 of the Canadian market as of that date.In November 2011 Japanese ecommerce company Rakuten purchased the company for US 315 million in cash. Around 58 of Kobo was owned by Indigo at the time of the purchase. Employee programs Indigo was listed as one of Canada 's Top 20 Employer Brands in the 2018 survey by Randstad Holding. This is due in part to staff rewards program which includes benefits eligibility for both full-time and part-time employees. Indigo also offers company-matched RRSP program and yearly employee scholarships. Criticism and controversies Product removal In 2001 Indigo removed Adolf Hitler 's Mein Kampf from the shelves. In 2006 Indigo decided not to sell the June issue of Harper 's Magazine which reprinted the controversial cartoons of the Muslim prophet Muhammad that had led to violent demonstrations around the world. Indigo also did not distribute the issue of Western Standard which reprinted and discussed those same cartoons. The company has also reportedly refused to stock several titles by David Icke and firearms magazines. Support of Israel by owners In the summer of 2006 the company was targeted by social activists from NION and the Coalition Against Israeli Apartheid. According to report in This Magazine CAIA advocated the boycott of Chapters/Indigo stores due to principals Reisman and Schwartz forming the Heseg Foundation for soldiers serving in the Israeli army that have no family living in the state of Israel. The article claimed Reisman and Schwartz donate million year to the Foundation. Competitive position The Indigo/Chapters chain has been criticized over what some perceive as virtual monopoly over retail-based book sales in Canada. In 2002 the company strongly opposed the entry of Amazon into the Canadian marketplace with accusations the U.S.-based company was skirting regulations about foreign ownership of Canadian booksellers.Indigo 's expansion has been blamed among other factors for the financial difficulties of some independent booksellers in Canada. In particular its rise coincided with the bankruptcy of Lichtman 's once Canada 's largest independent bookseller.

History The company was founded in 1996 by Heather Reisman who is married to Gerry Schwartz majority owner and CEO of Onex Corporation. The company 's first big-box bookstore initially called Indigo Books Music More was opened in Burlington Ontario on September 1997. With financing from Onex Corporation Indigo bought Chapters their largest Canadian competitor in 2001 and continues to operate many stores under the Chapters banner.

On Unix-like systems in particular this causes it to stand out both because lowercase filenames are more common and because the ls command commonly sorts and displays files in ASCII-code order in which uppercase filenames will appear first. Contents README file typically encompasses Configuration instructions Installation instructions Operating instructions file manifest list of files in the directory or archive Copyright and licensing information Contact information for the distributor or author list of known bugs Troubleshooting instructions Credits and acknowledgments changelog usually aimed at fellow programmers news section usually aimed at end users History It is unclear when the convention of including README file began but examples dating to the mid-1970s have been found. Early Macintosh system software installed Read Me on the Startup Disk and README files commonly accompanied third-party software. In particular there is long history of free software and open-source software including README file the GNU Coding Standards encourage including one to provide general overview of the package .Since the advent of the web as de facto standard platform for software distribution many software packages have moved or occasionally copied some of the above ancillary files and pieces of information to website or wiki sometimes including the README itself or sometimes leaving behind only brief README file without all of the information required by new user of the software. The popular source code hosting website GitHub strongly encourages the creation of README file if one exists in the main top-level directory of repository it is automatically presented on the repository 's front page. In addition to plain text various other formats and file extensions are also supported and HTML conversion takes extensions into account in particular README.md is treated as GitHub Flavored Markdown. As generic term The expression readme file is also sometimes used generically for other files with similar purpose. For example the source-code distributions of many free software packages especially those following the Gnits Standards or those produced with GNU Autotools include standard set of readme files Also commonly distributed with software packages are an FAQ file and TODO file which lists planned improvements.

Negation,In logic negation also called the logical complement is an operation that takes proposition \displaystyle to another proposition not \displaystyle written \displaystyle \neg \displaystyle \mathord \sim or \displaystyle \overline. It is interpreted intuitively as being true when \displaystyle is false and false when \displaystyle is true. Negation is thus unary logical connective. It may be applied as an operation on notions propositions truth values or semantic values more generally. In classical logic negation is normally identified with the truth function that takes truth to falsity and vice versa. In intuitionistic logic according to the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation the negation of proposition \displaystyle is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of \displaystyle.,"In logic negation also called the logical complement is an operation that takes proposition \displaystyle to another proposition not \displaystyle written \displaystyle \neg \displaystyle \mathord \sim or \displaystyle \overline. It is interpreted intuitively as being true when \displaystyle is false and false when \displaystyle is true. Negation is thus unary logical connective. It may be applied as an operation on notions propositions truth values or semantic values more generally. In classical logic negation is normally identified with the truth function that takes truth to falsity and vice versa. In intuitionistic logic according to the Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation the negation of proposition \displaystyle is the proposition whose proofs are the refutations of \displaystyle. Definition Classical negation is an operation on one logical value typically the value of proposition that produces value of true when its operand is false and value of false when its operand is true. Thus if statement is true then \displaystyle \neg pronounced not would then be false and conversely if \displaystyle \neg is false then would be true. The truth table of \displaystyle \neg is as follows Negation can be defined in terms of other logical operations. For example \displaystyle \neg can be defined as \displaystyle P\rightarrow \bot where \displaystyle \rightarrow is logical consequence and \displaystyle \bot is absolute falsehood. Conversely one can define \displaystyle \bot as \displaystyle Q\land \neg for any proposition where \displaystyle \land is logical conjunction. The idea here is that any contradiction is false and while these ideas work in both classical and intuitionistic logic they do not work in paraconsistent logic where contradictions are not necessarily false. In classical logic we also get further identity \displaystyle P\rightarrow can be defined as \displaystyle \neg P\lor where \displaystyle \lor is logical disjunction. Algebraically classical negation corresponds to complementation in Boolean algebra and intuitionistic negation to pseudocomplementation in Heyting algebra. These algebras provide semantics for classical and intuitionistic logic respectively. Notation The negation of proposition is notated in different ways in various contexts of discussion and fields of application. The following table documents some of these variants The notation Np is Łukasiewicz notation. In set theory \displaystyle \setminus is also used to indicate 'not in the set of \displaystyle U\setminus is the set of all members of that are not members of. Regardless how it is notated or symbolized the negation \displaystyle \neg can be read as it is not the case that not that or usually more simply as not. Properties Double negation Within system of classical logic double negation that is the negation of the negation of proposition \displaystyle is logically equivalent to \displaystyle. Expressed in symbolic terms \displaystyle \neg \neg P\equiv. In intuitionistic logic proposition implies its double negation but not conversely. This marks one important difference between classical and intuitionistic negation. Algebraically classical negation is called an involution of period two. However in intuitionistic logic the weaker equivalence \displaystyle \neg \neg \neg P\equiv \neg does hold. This is because in intuitionistic logic \displaystyle \neg is just shorthand for \displaystyle P\rightarrow \bot and we also have \displaystyle P\rightarrow \neg \neg. Composing that last implication with triple negation \displaystyle \neg \neg P\rightarrow \bot implies that \displaystyle P\rightarrow \bot. As result in the propositional case sentence is classically provable if its double negation is intuitionistically provable. This result is known as Glivenko 's theorem. Distributivity De Morgan 's laws provide way of distributing negation over disjunction and conjunction \displaystyle \neg P\lor \equiv \neg P\land \neg and \displaystyle \neg P\land \equiv \neg P\lor \neg. Linearity Let \displaystyle \oplus denote the logical xor operation. In Boolean algebra linear function is one such that If there exists \displaystyle a_ a_ \dots a_ \in 0,1\ \displaystyle b_ b_ \dots b_ =a_ \oplus a_ \land b_ \oplus \dots \oplus a_ \land b_ for all \displaystyle b_ b_ \dots b_ \in 0,1\. Another way to express this is that each variable always makes difference in the truth-value of the operation or it never makes difference. Negation is linear logical operator. Self dual In Boolean algebra self dual function is function such that \displaystyle a_ \dots a_ =\neg \neg a_ \dots \neg a_ for all \displaystyle a_ \dots a_ \in 0,1\. Negation is self dual logical operator. Negations of quantifiers In first-order logic there are two quantifiers one is the universal quantifier \displaystyle \forall means for all and the other is the existential quantifier \displaystyle \exists means there exists. The negation of one quantifier is the other quantifier \displaystyle \neg \forall xP \equiv \exists x\neg and \displaystyle \neg \exists xP \equiv \forall x\neg. For example with the predicate as is mortal and the domain of as the collection of all humans \displaystyle \forall xP means person in all humans is mortal or all humans are mortal. The negation of it is \displaystyle \neg \forall xP \equiv \exists x\neg meaning there exists person in all humans who is not mortal or there exists someone who lives forever. Rules of inference There are number of equivalent ways to formulate rules for negation. One usual way to formulate classical negation in natural deduction setting is to take as primitive rules of inference negation introduction from derivation of \displaystyle to both \displaystyle and \displaystyle \neg infer \displaystyle \neg this rule also being called reductio ad absurdum negation elimination from \displaystyle and \displaystyle \neg infer \displaystyle this rule also being called ex falso quodlibet and double negation elimination from \displaystyle \neg \neg infer \displaystyle. One obtains the rules for intuitionistic negation the same way but by excluding double negation elimination. Negation introduction states that if an absurdity can be drawn as conclusion from \displaystyle then \displaystyle must not be the case i.e. \displaystyle is false classically or refutable intuitionistically or etc. Negation elimination states that anything follows from an absurdity. Sometimes negation elimination is formulated using primitive absurdity sign \displaystyle \bot. In this case the rule says that from \displaystyle and \displaystyle \neg follows an absurdity. Together with double negation elimination one may infer our originally formulated rule namely that anything follows from an absurdity. Typically the intuitionistic negation \displaystyle \neg of \displaystyle is defined as \displaystyle P\rightarrow \bot. Then negation introduction and elimination are just special cases of implication introduction conditional proof and elimination modus ponens. In this case one must also add as primitive rule ex falso quodlibet. Programming language and ordinary language As in mathematics negation is used in computer science to construct logical statements. The exclamation mark. signifies logical NOT in and languages with C-inspired syntax such as C++ Java JavaScript Perl and PHP. NOT is the operator used in ALGOL 60 BASIC and languages with an ALGOL- or BASIC-inspired syntax such as Pascal Ada Eiffel and Seed7. Some languages C++ Perl etc. provide more than one operator for negation. few languages like PL/I and Ratfor use for negation. Most modern languages allow the above statement to be shortened from if. to if which allows sometimes when the compiler/interpreter is not able to optimize it faster programs. In computer science there is also bitwise negation. This takes the value given and switches all the binary 1s to 0s and 0s to 1s. See bitwise operation. This is often used to create ones complement or in or C++ and two 's complement just simplified to or the negative sign since this is equivalent to taking the arithmetic negative value of the number as it basically creates the opposite negative value equivalent or mathematical complement of the value where both values are added together they create whole. To get the absolute positive equivalent value of given integer the following would work as the changes it from negative to positive it is negative because yields true To demonstrate logical negation Inverting the condition and reversing the outcomes produces code that is logically equivalent to the original code i.e. will have identical results for any input note that depending on the compiler used the actual instructions performed by the computer may differ. This convention occasionally surfaces in ordinary written speech as computer-related slang for not. For example the phrase voting means not voting. Another example is the phrase clue which is used as synonym for no-clue or clueless. Kripke semantics In Kripke semantics where the semantic values of formulae are sets of possible worlds negation can be taken to mean set-theoretic complementation see also possible world semantics for more.

Taa language,Taa also known as ǃXóõ also spelled ǃKhong and ǃXoon Taa pronunciation ǃ͡χɔ̃ː˦ is Tuu language notable for its large number of phonemes perhaps the largest in the world. It is also notable for having perhaps the heaviest functional load of click consonants with one count finding that 82 of basic vocabulary items started with click. Most speakers live in Botswana but few hundred live in Namibia. The people call themselves ǃXoon pl. ǃXooŋake or ʼNǀohan pl. Nǀumde depending on the dialect they speak.

Most living Taa speakers are ethnic ǃXoon plural ǃXooŋake or 'Nǀohan plural Nǀumde .Taa shares number of characteristic features with West ǂʼAmkoe and Gǀui which together are considered part of the Kalahari Basin sprachbund. Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length.

To pronounce ǃXuun pronounced ǃ͡χũː˦˥ in Western ǃKung/ǃXuun one makes click sound before the sound which is like Scottish or German ch followed by long nasal vowel with high rising tone. Names The term ǃKung or variants thereof is typically used when considering the dialects to constitute single language Ju tends to be used when considering them as small language family. ǃKung is also sometimes used for the northern/northwestern dialects as opposed to the well documented Juǀʼhoan dialects in the south east however speakers of nearly all dialects call themselves ǃKung. The spellings ǃXun and ǃXuun seen in recent literature are related to the Juǀʼhoan form spelled ǃXʼu in the 1975 orthography or ǃKu in current orthography. Additional spellings are ǃHu ǃKhung ǃKu Kung Qxü ǃung ǃXo Xû ǃXû Xun ǃXung ǃXũũ ǃXun ʗhũ and additional spellings of Ju are Dzu Juu Zhu. Speakers If the ǃKung dialects are counted together they would make the third-most-populous click language after Khoekhoe and Sandawe. The most populous ǃKung variety Juǀʼhoan is perhaps tied for third place with Naro. Estimates vary but there are probably around 15,000 speakers. Counting is difficult because speakers are scattered on farms interspersed with speakers of other languages but Brenzinger 2011 counts 9,000 in Namibia 2,000 in Botswana 3,700 in South Africa and 1,000 in Angola down from perhaps 8,000 in 1975. Until the mid–late twentieth century the northern dialects were widespread in southern and central Angola. However most ǃKung fled the Angolan Civil War to Namibia primarily to the Caprivi Strip where they were recruited into the South African Defence Force special forces against the Angolan Army and SWAPO. At the end of the Border War more than one thousand fighters and their families were relocated to Schmidtsdrift in South Africa amid uncertainty over their future in Namibia. After more than decade living in precarious conditions the post-Apartheid government bought and donated land for permanent settlement at Platfontein near Schmidtsdrift.Only Juǀʼhoan is written and it is not sufficiently intelligible with the Northwestern dialects for the same literature to be used for both. Varieties The better-known ǃKung dialects are Tsumkwe Juǀʼhoan Ekoka ǃKung ǃʼOǃKung and ǂKxʼauǁʼein. Scholars distinguish between eleven and fifteen dialects but the boundaries are unclear. There is clear distinction between North/Northwest vs South/Southeast but also diverse Central group that is poorly attested. Heine Honken 2010 Heine Honken 2010 classify the 11 traditionally numbered dialects into three branches of what they consider single language Northern–Western ǃXunNorthern ǃXun N1 Maligo ǃxuun kúándò ǃxuun Kwando ǃXuun SE Angola N2 ǃʼOǃKung ǃʼo ǃuŋ Forest ǃXuun eastern Angola Western ǃXun W1 ǃxūún ǃʼālè ǃxòān Valley ǃXuun Eenhana district Namibia W2 ǀʼAkhwe ǃxūún ǀʼākhòè ǃxòān Kwanyama ǃXuun Eenhana Namibia W3 Tsintsabis ǃxūún Tsintsabis Tsumeb district Namibia Kavango ǃXuun ǃxūún known as dom ǃxūún River ǃXuun in Ekoka Western Rundu district Namibia Angola adjacent Central ǃXun C1 Gaub Tsumeb district Namibia C2 Neitsas Grootfontein district Namibia tentatively also the Tsintsabis Leeunes and Mangetti different from Mangetti Dune dialectsSoutheastern ǃXun E1 Juǀʼhoan ju-ǀʼhoan -si Tsumkwe district Namibia Bots adjacent E2 Dikundu ǃxun ju-ǀʼhoa si Dikundu Caprivi E3 ǂKxʼauǁʼein ju-ǀʼhoan -si ǃxun ǂxʼāōǁʼàèn Northern people Gobabis district Namibia Heine König 2015 p. 324 state that speakers of all Northwestern dialects understand one another to quite some extent but that they do not understand any of the Southeastern dialects. Sands 2010 Sands 2010 classifies ǃKung dialects into four clusters with the first two being quite close Northern ǃKung Southern Angola around the Cunene Cubango Cuito and Cuando rivers but with many refugees now in Namibia ǃʼOǃKung MaligoNorth-Central ǃKung Namibia between the Ovambo River and the Angolan border around the tributaries of the Okavango River east of Rundu to the Etosha Pan Tsintsabis Okongo Ovambo Mpunguvlei ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka Central ǃKung The area around Grootfontein Namibia west of the central Omatako River and south of the Ovambo River Southeastern ǃKung Botswana east of the Okavango Delta and northeast Namibia from near Windhoek to Rundu Gobabis and the Caprivi Strip Tsumkwe Omatako Kameeldoring Epukiro.ǂKxʼauǁʼein was too poorly attested to classify at the time. Snyman 1997 preliminary classification of the Xũũ and Žuǀ'hõasi dialects by Snyman 1997 Southern Žuǀʼhõansi Epukiro Žuǀʼhõansi is bounded by the Omuramba Otjozondjou stretching along the Omuramba Epukiro and north of the Sandfontein Omuramba up to Ghanzi in Botswana. Tsumkwe Žuǀʼhõansi is spoken east of 20° longitude from the Omuramba Otjozondjou up to the Kaudom Omuramba and extending to Samagaigai in the west and 22° longitude in Botswana. Rundu Žuǀʼhõansi presumably occurs south of the Okavango river from Rupara south-eastward to Ncaute and then north of the Omuramba Kaudom. Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi consists of northern dialect probably stretching from Ncaute southwards up to ca. 100km South of Karakuwisa and southern dialect extending southwards to include the tributaries of the Omatako viz. the Omambonde Klein Omatako and Gunib. The dialects are probably spoken in an area about 40 km wide along the river. According to the map in Westhpal 1956 the upper reaches of the Gunib Omuramba as well as the Omuramba Otjozondjou i.e. the area between Okozonduzu Omazera and Blignaut was Haillom territory. This area roughly lies on the watershed between the Omatako and the Otjozondjou which served as natural boundary between the Epukiro and Omatako Žuǀʼhõansi. Central Xũũ Grootfontein Xũũ is found in the district to the north-east east and south-east of the town of Grootfontein. Tsintsabis Xũũ is restricted to the North-eastern part of the Tsumeb district and adjacent areas in the western and eastern Mangetti. Okongo Xũũ is found in the Okongo Olokula Ekoka and Otyolo area of Northeastern Owambo. Northern Xũũ Mpungu Xũũ occurs in the Tondoro and Mpungu area of the north-western Kavango and presumably in adjacent areas in Angola. This dialect clearly forms transition from Okongo Xũũ to the other dialects of the Northern dialect cluster. Cuando/Quito Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Quilo/Cubango Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Cubango/Cunene Xũũ presumably belonged in the area between these rivers. Proto-language The ancestral language Proto-Juu or Proto-ǃXuun had five places of click articulation Dental alveolar palatal alveolar lateral and retroflex. The retroflex clicks have dropped out of Southeastern dialects such as Juǀʼhoan but remain in Central ǃKung. In ǀʼAkhwe Ekoka the palatal click has become fricated alveolar.

Classification Until the rediscovery of few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family. Dialects There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as dialect continuum than single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups suggesting historical spread from west to east West Taa Anthony Traill 's West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen East Taa ǃAma Western Eastern East ǃXoon Lone Tree Tsaasi–ǂHuan Tsaasi ǂHuanTraill worked primarily with East ǃXoon and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan in East Taa and West ǃXoon. ǀʼAuni and Kiǀhazi previously considered dialects of Taa were more divergent than the dialects here and are now classified as distinct language Lower Nossob. Alternate names The various dialects and social groups of the Taa their many names the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified has resulted in great deal of confusion. Traill 1974 for example spent two chapters of his Compleat Guide to the Koon sic disentangling names and dialects.The name ǃXoon more precisely ǃXóõ is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked and at Dzutshwa Botswana. It is however used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled ǃxō ǃkɔ̃ː ǃko/ǃkõ Khong and the fully anglicized Koon. Bleek 's Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled ǀNuǁen ǀNuǁe꞉n Ngǀuǁen Nguen Nǀhuǁéi ŋǀuǁẽin ŋǀuǁẽi ŋǀuǁen ǀuǁen. It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term Nǀusan Nǀu-san Nǀūsā Nǀuusaa Nǀhusi sometimes rendered Nusan or Noosan which has been used for other languages in the area. subgroup was known as Koon kɔ̃ː. This dialect is apparently extinct. Westphal studied ǂHuan ǂhũa dialect or ǂHũa-ʘwani and used this name for the entire language. However the term is ambiguous between Taa Western ǂHũa and ǂʼAmkoe Eastern ǂHũa and for this reason Traill chose to call the language ǃXóõ. Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan and like ǂHuan the name is used ambiguously for dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is Tswana name variously rendered Tshasi Tshase Tʃase Tsase Sasi and Sase. The Tswana term for Bushmen Masarwa is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are Magon Magong and the Tshasi mentioned above. The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in plain people river people etc. and also by direction. Traill reports the following ǃama ʘʔâni westerners ǂhūã ʘʔâni southerners ʘqhōa ʘʔâni in-betweeners tùu ʔʘnāhnsā̂ pure people Heinz reports that ǃxóõ is an exonym given by other Bushmen and that the Taa call themselves ǃxoia. The Taa refer to their language as tâa ǂâã people 's language. Westphal 1971 adopted the word tâa person as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family which is now called Tuu. The East ǃXoon term for the language is ǃxóɲa ǂâã IPA ǃ͡χɔ˦ ɲa˧ ǂãː˧˩. Phonology Taa has at least 58 consonants 31 vowels and four tones Traill 1985 1994 on East ǃXoon or at least 87 consonants 20 vowels and two tones DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon by many counts the most of any known language if non-oral vowel qualities are counted as different from corresponding oral vowels. These include 20 Traill or 43 DoBeS click consonants and several vowel phonations though opinions vary as to which of the 130 Traill or 164 DoBeS consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters. Tones Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect high mid low and mid-falling. Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high mid-mid mid-mid-falling and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes high and low for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic Traill 's four tones are mapped onto áá àá àà and áà. Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Unlike Traill Naumann does not find four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.In addition to lexical tone Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs either level Tone Class or falling Tone Class II. Transitive object nouns from Tone Class trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs while Tone Class objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect. Vowels Taa has five vowel qualities. The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels it is not clear if this reflects dialectal difference or difference of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain ⟨a⟩ murmured ⟨ah⟩ or glottalized ⟨aʼ⟩. may also be both glottalized and murmured ⟨aʼh⟩ as well as pharyngealized ⟨a̰⟩/⟨aq⟩ or strident 'sphincteric ⟨a̰h⟩/⟨aqh⟩. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized ⟨a̰ʼ⟩ for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length. Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation. Vowels may be long or short but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation are ai ae ao au oi oe oa ou ui ue ua. All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of sequence long vowel or diphthong. These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally kǃxóŋ and this in turn may be phonemically /kǃxóɲ/ since does not occur word-finally. However this can not explain the short nasal vowels so Taa has at least 31 vowels. long glottalized murmured nasalized with falling tone is written ⟨ôʼhõ⟩. long strident nasalized with low tone is written ⟨òqhõ⟩ since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain nasalized an en in on un epiglottalized or pharyngealized aq eq iq oq uq strident aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh and glottalized or 'tense aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ. Consonants Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic as in dt such clusters are listed in the chart below. Taa consonants are complex and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis. ==== East ǃXoon Traill ==== Consonants in parentheses are rare. The nasal only occurs between vowels and only word finally and then only in some dialects for what are nasal vowels elsewhere so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position except that the last is an allophone of rare initial. dʒ and not in the table occur in loans mostly English. Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa has mixed voicing in d͡tʰ d͡tʃʰ d͡tsʼ .Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However there is some debate whether these are actually clusters all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like as in English tree sleep quick cue and this does not occur in Taa. There are five click articulations bilabial dental lateral alveolar and palatal. There are nineteen series differing in phonation manner and complexity see airstream contour. These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position. The DoBeS project takes Traill 's cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis voiced nasal and voiceless nasal clicks are basic with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with kxʼ qʰ ɢqʰ qʼ and either mˀ or nˀ. Work on Taa 's sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have uvular or rear articulation and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the 'prevoiced consonants of Taa including prevoiced clicks can also be analyzed as contour consonants in this case with voicing contours. DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill as the Ʞkʰ–Ʞqʰ and Ʞkʼ–Ʞqʼ distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS ⟨Ʞh⟩ and ⟨Ʞqh⟩ respectively correspond to the former pair while ⟨Ʞʼ⟩ and ⟨Ʞʼʼ⟩ presumably in that order as uvular clicks tend to have delayed release correspond to the latter pair. Traill 's account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon which uses voicing for morphological derivation to greater extent than East ǃXoon does has four additional series written nꞰʼʼ gꞰʼ gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill Ʞˀ ᵑꞰˀ Ʞkʼ Ʞqʼ. If Traill 's ɡꞰh series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated Ʞʰ rather than delayed aspirated that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration. All nasal clicks have twin airstreams since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However the ↓ŋ̊Ʞh series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic ingressive nasal airflow. Ladefoged Maddieson 1996:268 state that This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world 's languages that even in the middle of sentence it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow. Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated i.e. delayed aspirated clicks Miller 2011. ==== West ǃXoon DoBeS ==== West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in strict unit analysis including 111 clicks in 23 series which under cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants including 43 clicks. These are written in the practical orthography Naumann 2008. Marginal consonants are not marked as such. Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora in CCVV etc. syllables as it is phonetic effect of the ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks on the first mora. The ⟨nꞰhh⟩ clicks do not make the following vowel breathy maintaining contrast between ⟨nǂhha⟩ and ⟨nǂhhah⟩. Likewise while ⟨gꞰʼ⟩ clicks do make the following vowel creaky there is delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of ⟨gǂʼaʼ⟩ is less than that of ⟨gǂaʼ⟩ with phonemically creaky vowel. In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks ʼnꞰ which Traill had analyzed as /Ʞ/ /ʼn/ and the voiced aspirated clicks gꞰh which Traill had analyzed as /ɡꞰ/ /qʰ/. The expectation from the morphology of ǃXoon for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on. These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all namely nꞰʼʼ nꞰhh gꞰʼ and gꞰqʼ. It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series Ʞqh and Ʞh for Trail 's Ʞqh and Ʞkh as well as Ʞʼʼ and Ʞʼ for Traill 's Ʞqʼ and Ʞkʼ or perhaps vice versa. If Traill 's Ʞkh series is to be analyzed as kꞰ then that would require different assessment of Traill 's delayed-aspiration series. Under the contour analysis of Miller 2009 the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters apart from the last four rows Ʞʼʼ nꞰʼʼ Ʞhh nꞰhh which are considered to be simple clicks. Phonotactics The Taa syllable structure as described by DoBeS may be one of the following CVV CCVV CVC2V CCVC2V CVN CCVNwhere is consonant is vowel and is nasal stop. There is very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second C2 position and only certain vowel sequences VV and V…V occur. The possible consonant clusters CC is covered above C2 may be b~β̞ dʲ~j. Grammar Taa is subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives adjectives relative clauses and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns transitive verbs with the object adjectives prepositions and some particles. Numbers Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi. ǂʔûã ǂnûm ǁâe Phrases The phrases from Eastern ǃXóõ were compiled by Anthony Traill References Traill Anthony 1985.

Quotation mark,Quotation marks also known as quotes quote marks speech marks inverted commas or talking marks are punctuation marks used in pairs in various writing systems to set off direct speech quotation or phrase. The pair consists of an opening quotation mark and closing quotation mark which may or may not be the same character.Quotation marks have variety of forms in different languages and in different media.,Quotation marks also known as quotes quote marks speech marks inverted commas or talking marks are punctuation marks used in pairs in various writing systems to set off direct speech quotation or phrase. The pair consists of an opening quotation mark and closing quotation mark which may or may not be the same character.Quotation marks have variety of forms in different languages and in different media. History The single quotation mark is traced to Ancient Greek practice adopted and adapted by monastic copyists. Isidore of Seville in his seventh century encyclopedia Etymologiae described their use of the Greek diplé chevron 13 Diple. Hanc scriptores nostri adponunt in libris ecclesiasticorum virorum ad separanda vel ad demonstranda testimonia sanctarum Scripturarum. 13 Diplé. Our copyists place this sign in the books of the people of the Church to separate or to indicate the quotations drawn from the Holy Scriptures. The double quotation mark derives from marginal notation used in fifteenth-century manuscript annotations to indicate passage of particular importance not necessarily quotation the notation was placed in the outside margin of the page and was repeated alongside each line of the passage. In his edition of the works of Aristotle which appeared in 1483 or 1484 the Milanese Renaissance humanist Francesco Filelfo marked literal and appropriate quotes with oblique double dashes on the left margin of each line. Until then literal quotations had been highlighted or not at the author 's discretion. Non-verbal loans were marked on the edge. After the publication of Filelfo 's edition the quotation marks for literal quotations prevailed. During the seventeenth century this treatment became specific to quoted material and it grew common especially in Britain to print quotation marks now in the modern opening and closing forms at the beginning and end of the quotation as well as in the margin the French usage see under Specific language features below is remnant of this. In most other languages including English the marginal marks dropped out of use in the last years of the eighteenth century. The usage of pair of marks opening and closing at the level of lower case letters was generalized. By the nineteenth century the design and usage began to be specific to each region. In Western Europe the custom became to use the quotation mark pairs with the convexity of each mark aimed outward. In Britain those marks were elevated to the same height as the top of capital letters. In France by the end of the nineteenth century the marks were modified to an angular shape. Some authors claim that the reason for this was practical one in order to get character that was clearly distinguishable from the apostrophes the commas and the parentheses. Also in other scripts the angular quotation marks are distinguishable from other punctuation characters the Greek breathing marks the Armenian emphasis and apostrophe the Arabic comma the decimal separator the thousands separator etc. Other authors claim that the reason for this was an aesthetic one. The elevated quotation marks created an extra white space before and after the word which was considered aesthetically unpleasing while the in-line quotation marks helped to maintain the typographical color since the quotation marks had the same height and were aligned with the lower case letters. Nevertheless while other languages do not insert space between the quotation marks and the word the French usage does insert them even if it is narrow space. The curved quotation marks 66-99 usage was exported to some non-Latin scripts notably where there was some English influence for instance in Native American scripts and Indic scripts. On the other hand Greek Cyrillic Arabic and Ethiopic adopted the French angular quotation marks. The Far East angle bracket quotation marks 《…》 are also development of the in-line angular quotation marks.In Central Europe the practice was to use the quotation mark pairs with the convexity aimed inward. The German tradition preferred the curved quotation marks the first one at the level of the commas the second one at the level of the apostrophes. Alternatively these marks could be angular and in-line with lower case letters but still pointing inward. Some neighboring regions adopted the German curved marks tradition with lower–upper alignment while some adopted variant with the convexity of the closing mark aimed rightward like the opening one. Sweden and Finland choose convention where the convexity of both marks was aimed to the right but lined up both at the top level. In Eastern Europe there was hesitation between the French tradition and the German tradition. The French tradition prevailed in Eastern Europe Russia Ukraine and Belarus whereas the German tradition or its modified version with the convexity of the closing mark aimed rightward has become dominant in Southeastern Europe e.g. in the Balkan countries. The reemergence of single quotation marks around 1800 came about as means of indicating secondary level of quotation. In some languages using the angular quotation marks the usage of the single guillemet ‹…› became obsolete being replaced by double curved ones though the single ones still survive for instance in Switzerland. In Russia Ukraine and Belarus the curved quotation marks are used as secondary level when the angular marks are used as primary level. In English In English writing quotation marks are placed in pairs around word or phrase to indicate Quotation or direct speech Carol said Go ahead when asked her if the launcher was ready. Mention in another work of the title of short or subsidiary work such as chapter or an episode Encounter at Farpoint was the pilot episode of Star Trek The Next Generation. Scare quotes used to mean so-called or to express irony The fresh bread was all dried up.In American writing quotation marks are normally the double kind the primary style. If quotation marks are used inside another pair of quotation marks then single quotation marks are used. For example Did n't she say like red best when asked her wine preferences. he asked his guests. If another set of quotation marks is nested inside single quotation marks double quotation marks are used again and they continue to alternate as necessary though this is rarely done. British publishing is regarded as more flexible about whether double or single quotation marks should be used. tendency to use single quotation marks in British writing is thought to have arisen after the mid-19th century invention of steam-powered presses and the consequent rise of London and New York as distinct industrialized publishing centers whose publishing houses adhered to separate norms. The King 's English in 1908 noted that the prevailing British practice was to use double marks for most purposes and single ones for quotations within quotations. Different media now follow different conventions in the United Kingdom. Different varieties and styles of English have different conventions regarding whether terminal punctuation should be written inside or outside the quotation marks. North American printing usually puts full stops and commas but not colons semicolons exclamation or question marks inside the closing quotation mark whether it is part of the original quoted material or not. Styles elsewhere vary widely and have different rationales for placing it inside or outside often matter of house style. Regarding their appearance there are two types of quotation marks '… and are known as neutral vertical straight typewriter dumb or ASCII quotation marks. The left and right marks are identical. These are found on typical English typewriters and computer keyboards although they are sometimes automatically converted to the other type by software. and are known as typographic curly curved book or smart quotation marks. The doubled ones are more informally known as 66 and 99. The beginning marks are commas raised to the top of the line and rotated 180 degrees. The ending marks are commas raised to the top of the line. Curved quotation marks are used mainly in manuscript printing and typesetting. Type cases of any language generally have the curved quotation mark metal types for the respective language and may lack the vertical quotation mark metal types. Because most computer keyboards lack keys to enter typographic quotation marks directly much that is written using word-processing programs has vertical quotation marks. The smart quotes feature in some computer software can convert vertical quotation marks to curly ones although sometimes imperfectly.The closing single quotation mark is identical in form to the apostrophe and similar to the prime symbol. The double quotation mark is identical to the ditto mark in English-language usage. It is also similar to—and often used to represent—the double prime symbol. These all serve different purposes. Summary table Other languages have similar conventions to English but use different symbols or different placement. Specific language features Bulgarian Contemporary Bulgarian employs em dash or quotation horizontal bar followed by space characer at the beginning of each direct-speech segment by different character in order to mark direct speech in prose and in most journalistic question and answer interviews in such cases the use of standard quotation marks is left for in-text citations or to mark the names of institutions companies and sometimes also brand or model names.Air quotes are also widely used in face-to-face communication in contemporary Bulgarian but usually resemble ... secondary ... unlike written Bulgarian quotation marks. Dutch The standard form in the preceding table is taught in schools and used in handwriting. Most large newspapers have kept these low-high quotation marks and otherwise the alternative form with single or double English-style quotes is now often the only form seen in printed matter. Neutral straight quotation marks and are used widely especially in texts typed on computers and on websites.Although not generally common in the Netherlands any more double angle guillemet quotation marks are still sometimes used in Belgium. Examples include the Flemish HUMO magazine and the Metro newspaper in Brussels. German The symbol used as the left typographical quote in English is used as the right quote in Germany and Austria and low double comma not used in English is used for the left quote. Its single quote form looks like comma. Some fonts e.g. Verdana were not designed with the flexibility to use an English left quote as German right quote. Such fonts are therefore typographically incompatible with this German usage. Double quotes are standard for denoting speech in German. Andreas fragte mich Hast du den Artikel ‚EU-Erweiterung gelesen Andreas asked me Have you read the 'EU Expansion article. This style of quoting is also used in Bulgarian Czech Danish Estonian Georgian Icelandic Latvian Lithuanian Russian Serbo-Croatian Slovak Slovene and in Ukrainian. In Bulgarian Icelandic Estonian Lithuanian and Russian single quotation marks are not used.Sometimes especially in novels guillemets angle quotation mark sets are used in Germany and Austria albeit in reversed order compared to French ›B‹ Andreas fragte mich Hast du den Artikel ›EU-Erweiterung‹ gelesen Andreas asked me Have you read the 'EU Expansion article. In Switzerland the French-style angle quotation mark sets are also used for German printed text ‹B› Andreas fragte mich Hast du den Artikel ‹EU-Erweiterung› gelesen Andreas asked me 'Have you read the EU Expansion article. Finnish and Swedish In Finnish and Swedish right quotes called citation marks are used to mark both the beginning and the end of quote. Double right-pointing angular quotes can also be used. Alternatively an en-dash followed by non-breaking space can be used to denote the beginning of quoted speech in which case the end of the quotation is not specifically denoted see section Quotation dash below. line-break should not be allowed between the en-dash and the first word of the quotation. French French uses angle quotation marks guillemets or duck-foot quotes adding 'quarter-em space within the quotes. Many people now use the non-breaking space because the difference between non-breaking space and four-per-em is virtually imperceptible but also because the Unicode quarter-em space is breakable and the quarter-em glyph is omitted from many fonts. Even more commonly many people just put normal breaking space between the quotation marks because the non-breaking space can not be accessed easily from the keyboard furthermore many are simply not aware of this typographical refinement. Using the wrong type of space often results in quotation mark appearing alone at the beginning of line since the quotation mark is treated as an independent word. Voulez-vous un sandwich Henri. Would you like sandwich Henri Sometimes for instance on several French news sites such as Libération Les Échos or Le Figaro no space is used around the quotation marks. This parallels normal usage in other languages e.g. Catalan Polish Portuguese Ukrainian or in German French and Italian as written in Switzerland Dies ist ein Zitat. Swiss Standard German To jest cytat. Polish Це цитата. Ukrainian This is quote. Initially the French guillemet characters were not angle shaped but also used the comma 6/9 shape. They were different from English quotes because they were standing like today 's guillemets on the baseline like lowercase letters and not above it like apostrophes and English quotation marks or hanging down from it like commas. At the beginning of the nineteenth century this shape evolved to look like small parentheses. The angle shape appeared later to increase the distinction and avoid confusions with apostrophes commas and parentheses in handwritten manuscripts submitted to publishers. Unicode currently does not provide alternate codes for these 6/9 guillemets on the baseline as they are considered to be form variants of guillemets implemented in older French typography such as the Didot font design. Also there was not necessarily any distinction of shape between the opening and closing guillemets with both types pointing to the right like today 's French closing guillemets. They must be used with non-breaking spaces preferably narrow if available i.e. U+202F narrow no-break space which is present in all up-to-date general-purpose fonts but still missing in some computer fonts from the early years of Unicode due to the belated encoding of U+202F 1999 after the flaw of not giving U+2008 punctuation space non-breakable property as it was given to the related U+2007 figure space. Legacy support of narrow non-breakable spaces was done at rendering level only without interoperability as provided by Unicode support. High-end renderers as found in Desktop Publishing software should therefore be able to render this space using the same glyph as the breaking thin space U+2009 handling the non-breaking property internally in the text renderer/layout engine because line-breaking properties are never defined in fonts themselves such renderers should also be able to infer any width of space and make them available as application controls as is done with justifying/non-justifying. In old-style printed books when quotations span multiple lines of text including multiple paragraphs an additional closing quotation sign is traditionally used at the beginning of each line continuing quotation any right-pointing guillemet at the beginning of line does not close the current quotation. This convention has been consistently used since the beginning of the 19th century by most book printers but is no longer in use today. Such insertion of continuation quotation marks occurred even if there is word hyphenation break. Given this feature has been obsoleted there is no support for automatic insertion of these continuation guillemets in HTML or CSS nor in word-processors. Old-style typesetting is emulated by breaking up the final layout with manual line breaks and inserting the quotation marks at line start much like pointy brackets before quoted plain text e-mail est une belle journée pour les Montréalais soutient le ministre. Ces investissements stimuleront la crois- sance économique. Unlike English French does not set off unquoted material within quotation by using second set of quotation marks. Compare est une belle journée pour les Montréalais soutient le ministre. Ces investissements stimuleront la croissance économique. This is great day for Montrealers the minister maintained. These investments will stimulate economic growth. For clarity some newspapers put the quoted material in italics est une belle journée pour les Montréalais soutient le ministre. Ces investissements stimuleront la croissance économique. The French Imprimerie nationale cf. Lexique des règles typographiques en usage l'Imprimerie nationale presses de l'Imprimerie nationale Paris 2002 does not use different quotation marks for nesting quotes Son explication est qu un mensonge indigna le député. His 'explanation is just lie the deputy protested.In this case when there should be two adjacent opening or closing marks only one is written Il répondit Ce est qu un gadget. . He answered It 's only 'gizmo. The use of English quotation marks is increasing in French and usually follows English rules for instance in situations when the keyboard or the software context does n't allow the use of guillemets. The French news site L'Humanité uses straight quotation marks along with angle ones. English quotes are also used sometimes for nested quotations Son explication est qu un mensonge indigna le député. His 'explanation is just lie the deputy protested.But the most frequent convention used in printed books for nested quotations is to style them in italics. Single quotation marks are much more rarely used and multiple levels of quotations using the same marks is often considered confusing for readers Son explication est qu un mensonge indigna le député. Il répondit Ce est qu un gadget. .Further running speech does not use quotation marks beyond the first sentence as changes in speaker are indicated by dash as opposed to the English use of closing and re-opening the quotation. For other languages employing dashes see section Quotation dash below. The dashes may be used entirely without quotation marks as well. In general quotation marks are extended to encompass as much speech as possible including not just nonverbal text such as he said as previously noted but also as long as the conversion extends. The quotation marks end at the last spoken text rather than extending to the end of paragraphs when the final part is not spoken. Dumas Les trois mousquetaires am not speaking to you sir he said. But am speaking to you. cried the young man exasperated by this combination of insolence and good manners of protocol and disdain. Greek Greek uses angled quotation marks εισαγωγικά isagogiká Μιλάει σοβαρά ρώτησε την Μαρία.

When quotations are nested double and then single quotation marks are used. Hungarian According to current recommendation by the Hungarian Academy of Sciences the main Hungarian quotation marks are comma-shaped double quotation marks set on the base-line at the beginning of the quote and at apostrophe-height at the end of it for first level Quote reversed French quotes without space the German tradition for the second level and thus the following nested quotation pattern emerges Quote inside quote ... and with third level Quote inside inside of inside inside quote In Hungarian linguistic tradition the meaning of word is signified by uniform unpaired apostrophe-shaped quotation marks die Biene méh quotation dash is also used and is predominant in belletristic literature.

Polish According to current PN-83/P-55366 standard from 1983 but not dictionaries see below Typesetting rules for composing Polish text Zasady składania tekstów języku polskim one can use either ordinary Polish quotes or French quotes without space for first level and ‚single Polish quotes or French quotes for second level which gives three styles of nested quotes Quote ‚inside quote Quote inside quote Quote ‚inside quote There is no space on the internal side of quote marks with the exception of 1⁄4 firet 1⁄4 em space between two quotation marks when there are no other characters between them e.g. and. The above rules have not changed since at least the previous BN-76/7440-02 standard from 1976 and are probably much older. The rules on the use of guillemets conflict with the Polish punctuation standard as given by dictionaries including the Wielki Słownik Ortograficzny PWN recommended by the Polish Language Council. The PWN rules state In specific uses guillemets also appear. Guillemet marks pointing inwards are used for highlights and in case quotation occurs inside quotation. Guillemet marks pointing outwards are used for definitions mainly in scientific publications and dictionaries as well as for enclosing spoken lines and indirect speech especially in poetic texts. In Polish books and publications this style for use of guillemets also known as German quotes is used almost exclusively. In addition to being standard for second level quotes guillemet quotes are sometimes used as first level quotes in headings and titles but almost never in ordinary text in paragraphs. Another style of quoting is to use an em-dash to open quote this is used almost exclusively to quote dialogues and is virtually the only convention used in works of fiction. Mag skłonił się. Biały kot śpiący obok paleniska ocknął się nagle spojrzał na niego badawczo. Jak się nazywa ta wieś panie. zapytał przybysz. Kowal wzruszył ramionami. Głupi Osioł. Głupi .... Osioł powtórzył kowal takim tonem jakby wyzywał gościa żeby spróbował sobie niego zażartować. Mag zamyślił się. Ta nazwa ma pewnie swoją historię stwierdził końcu. innych okolicznościach chętnie bym jej wysłuchał. Ale chciałbym porozmawiać tobą kowalu twoim synu.The wizard bowed. white cat that had been sleeping by the furnace woke up and watched him carefully. What is the name of this place sir said the wizard. The blacksmith shrugged. Stupid Donkey he said. original English version is Bad Ass but that 's not common phrase in Polish Stupid— Donkey repeated the blacksmith his tone defying anyone to make something of it. The wizard considered this. name with story behind it he said at last which were circumstances otherwise would be pleased to hear. But would like to speak to you smith about your son. Terry Pratchett Equal Rites An en-dash is sometimes used in place of the em-dash especially so in newspaper texts. Portuguese Neither the Portuguese language regulator nor the Brazilian prescribe what is the shape for quotation marks they only prescribe when and how they should be used. In Portugal the angular quotation marks ex. quote are traditionally used. They are the Latin tradition quotation marks used normally by typographers. It is that also the chosen representation for displaying quotation marks in reference sources and it is also the chosen representation from some sites dedicated to the Portuguese Language.The Código de Redação for Portuguese-language documents published in the European Union prescribes three levels of quotation marks representation estava escrito Alguém perguntou Quem foi que gritou Meu Deus na folha de papel.And it was written Someone asked Who shouted My God. on the sheet of paper.in black main sentence which contains the quotations in green 1st level quotation in red 2nd level quotation in blue 3rd level quotation The usage of curved quotation marks ex. quote and quote is growing in Portugal. That is probably due to the omnipresence of the English language and to the corresponding difficulty or even inability of some machines mobile phones cash registers calculators etc. to enter the angular quotation marks. In Brazil angular quotation marks are rare and curved quotation marks quote and quote are almost always used. This can be verified by the difference between Portuguese keyboard which possesses specific key for and for and Brazilian keyboard. The Portuguese-speaking African countries tend to follow Portugal 's conventions not the Brazilian ones. Other usages of quotation marks quote for double ‹quote› for single are obsolete .. Belarusian Russian and Ukrainian In Belarusian Russian and Ukrainian the angled quotation Belarusian двукоссе Russian кавычки Ukrainian лапки marks are used without spaces. In case of quoted material inside quotation rules and most noted style manuals prescribe the use of different kinds of quotation marks. Example in Russian Пушкин писал Дельвигу Жду Цыганов тотчас тисну. Pushkin wrote to Delvig Waiting for 'Gypsies and publish at once. Example in Ukrainian звісно не обійтись без користування словником. Один мій знайомий поет літературознавець якось жартуючи сказав волію читати словники ніж поеми. словнику ті самі слова що поемі але подані систематизованому порядку. Це сказано жартома але читати словники не така вже дивовижна дивацька річ як може здатися. And of course you ca n't avoid using dictionary. One of my acquaintances poet and literary critic once jokingly said prefer to read dictionaries than poems. The dictionary has the same words as in the poem but is presented in systematic way. It 's joke but 'reading dictionaries is not as amazing and bizarre as it may seem. Spanish Spanish uses angled quotation marks comillas latinas or angulares as well but always without the spaces. Esto es un ejemplo de cómo se suele hacer una cita literal en español. This is an example of how literal quotation is usually written in Spanish. And when quotations are nested in more levels than inner and outer quotation the system is Antonio me dijo Vaya cacharro que se ha comprado Julián. Antonio told me 'What piece of junk Julián has purchased for himself .The use of English quotation marks is increasing in Spanish and the El País style guide which is widely followed in Spain recommends them. Hispanic Americans often use them owing to influence from the United States. Chinese Japanese and Korean Corner brackets are well-suited for Chinese Japanese and Korean languages which are written in both vertical and horizontal orientations. China South Korea and Japan all use corner brackets when writing vertically. Usage differs when writing horizontally In Japan corner brackets are used. In South Korea corner brackets and English-style quotes are used. In North Korea angle quotes are used. In Mainland China English-style quotes full width are official and prevalent corner brackets are rare today. The Unicode codepoints used are the English quotes rendered as fullwidth by the font not the fullwidth forms. In Taiwan Hong Kong and Macau where Traditional Chinese is used corner brackets are prevalent although English-style quotes are also used. In the Chinese language double angle brackets are placed around titles of books documents movies pieces of art or music magazines newspapers laws etc. When nested single angle brackets are used inside double angle brackets. With some exceptions this usage parallels the usage of italics in English 「你看過《三國演義》嗎？」他問我。 Have you read Romance of the Three Kingdoms. he asked me.White corner brackets are used to mark quote-within-quote segments in case corner brackets are used. Quotation dash Another typographical style is to omit quotation marks for lines of dialogue replacing them with an initial dash as in lines from James Joyce 's Ulysses saints above. Miss Douce said sighed above her jumping rose. wished had n't laughed so much. feel all wet. Miss Douce. Miss Kennedy protested. You horrid thing This style is particularly common in Bulgarian French Greek Hungarian Polish Portuguese Romanian Russian Spanish Swedish Turkish and Vietnamese. James Joyce always insisted on this style although his publishers did not always respect his preference. Alan Paton used this style in Cry the Beloved Country and no quotation marks at all in some of his later work. Charles Frazier used this style for his novel Cold Mountain as well. Details for individual languages are given above. The dash is often combined with ordinary quotation marks. For example in French guillemet may be used to initiate running speech with dash to indicate each change in speaker and closing guillemet to mark the end of the quotation. Dashes are also used in many modern English novels especially those written in nonstandard dialects. Some examples include James Joyce 's prose William Gaddis prose Trainspotting by Irvine Welsh M/F by Anthony Burgess The Book of Dave by Will Self which alternates between standard English chapters with standard quotation marks and dialect chapters with quotation dashes Scanner Darkly by Philip K. Dick not written in dialect The Ægypt Sequence by John Crowley in extracts from the fictional writings of the character Fellowes Kraft historical novelist. According to another character Kraft used dashes to indicate imaginary dialogue that was not documented in the original sources. The Van by Roddy Doyle You Shall Know Our Velocity by Dave Eggers in which spoken dialogues are written with the typical English quotation marks but dialogues imagined by the main character which feature prominently are written with quotation dashes Winter in the Hills by John Wain in which conversations in English are indicated by ordinary quotation marks and in Welsh by quotation dashesIn Italian Catalan Portuguese Spanish Ukrainian Russian Polish Bulgarian Georgian Romanian Lithuanian and Hungarian the reporting clause in the middle of quotation is separated with two additional dashes also note that the initial quotation dash is followed by single whitespace character as well as the fact that the additional quotation dashes for the middle main clause after the initial quotation dash are all with single whitespace character on both of their sides Ай ай ай. вскрикнул Левин. ведь кажется уже лет девять не говел. не подумал. Хорош. смеясь сказал Степан Аркадьевич меня же называешь нигилистом. Однако ведь это нельзя. Тебе надо говеть. Oh dear. exclaimed Levin. think it is nine years since went to communion. have n't thought about it. You are good one. remarked Oblonsky laughing. And you call me Nihilist. But it wo n't do you know you must confess and receive the sacrament. from Leo Tolstoy Anna Karenina Louise and Aylmer Maude translation Nem hagyják magukat mozgásban maradnak mondta Ron. Ahogy mi is. Well they keep on the move do n't they. said Ron. Like us. From J. K. Rowling 's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and its Hungarian translation by Tóth Tamás Boldizsár.In Finnish on the other hand second dash is added when the quote continues after reporting clause Et sinä ole paljon minkään näköinen sanoi Korkala melkein surullisesti mutta ei auta. You do n't seem to be anything special said Korkala almost sadly but there 's no help to it. Frakki älähti Huikari. Missä on frakki. Räätälissä sanoi Joonas rauhallisesti. Tailcoat yelped Huikari. Where is the tailcoat. At the tailor 's said Joonas calmly.The Unicode standard introduced separate character U+2015 HORIZONTAL BAR to be used as quotation dash. It may be the same length as an em-dash which is often used instead. Some software will insert line break after an em-dash but not after quotation dash. Both are displayed in the following table. Electronic documents Different typefaces character encodings and computer languages use various encodings and glyphs for quotation marks. Typewriters and early computers 'Ambidextrous or 'straight quotation marks were introduced on typewriters to minimise the number of keys on the keyboard and were inherited by computer keyboards and character sets. The ASCII character set which has been used on wide variety of computers since the 1960s only contains straight single quote U+0027 APOSTROPHE and double quote U+0022 QUOTATION MARK. Many systems such as the personal computers of the 1980s and early 1990s actually drew these ASCII quotes like closing quotes on-screen and in printouts so text would appear like this approximately These same systems often drew the backtick the free standing character U+0060 GRAVE ACCENT as an 'open quote glyph usually mirror image so it still sloped in the direction of grave accent. Using this character as the opening quote gave typographic approximation of curved single quotes. Nothing similar was available for the double quote so many people resorted to using two single quotes for double quotes which would look approximately like the following The typesetting application TeX uses this convention for input files. The following is an example of TeX input which yields proper curly quotation marks. Good morning Dave said HAL. Good morning Dave said HAL.The Unicode standard added codepoints for slanted or curved quotes U+201C LEFT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK and U+201D RIGHT DOUBLE QUOTATION MARK described further below shown here for comparison The Unicode mapping for PostScript Standard Encoding preserves the typographic approximation convention by mapping its equivalent of ASCII grave and single-quote to the Unicode curly quotation mark characters. Keyboard layouts Typographical quotation marks are almost absent on keyboards. In typewriter keyboards the curved quotation marks were not implemented. Instead to save space the straight quotation marks were invented as compromise. Even in countries that did not use curved quotation marks angular quotation marks were not implemented either. Computer keyboards followed the steps of typewriter keyboards. Most computer keyboards do not have specific keys for curved quotation marks or angled quotation marks. This may also have to do with computer character sets IBM character sets generally do not have curved quotation mark characters therefore keys for the curved quotation marks are absent in most IBM computer keyboards. Microsoft followed the example of IBM in its character set and keyboard design. Curved quotation marks were implemented later in Windows character sets but most Microsoft computer keyboards do not have dedicated key for the curved quotation mark characters. On keyboards with the Alt Gr key or both the Alt key and the numeric keypad they are accessible through series of keystrokes that involve these keys. Also techniques using their Unicode code points are available see Unicode input. Macintosh character sets have always had curved quotation marks available. Nevertheless these are mostly accessible through series of keystrokes involving the Opt key.In languages that use the curved ... quotation marks they are available in noneIn languages that use the angular ... quotation marks they are available in Macintosh Arabic keyboard Armenian keyboard Canadian keyboard French BÉPO keyboard Greek keyboard Khmer keyboard Latvian ergonomic keyboard Pashto keyboard Persian keyboard Portuguese keyboard Syriac keyboard Uyghur keyboardIn languages that use the corner bracket ... quotation marks they are available in Japanese keyboardIn languages that use the angle bracket ... they are available in Mongolian keyboard New Tai Lue keyboardIn languages that use the curved ... quotation marks they are available in Bulgarian keyboard Georgian keyboard Macedonian keyboardIn languages that use the curved ... quotation marks they are available in Romanian Standard SR 13392:2004 keyboardIn languages that use the curved ... quotation marks they are available in none Curved quotes within and across applications Historically support for curved quotes was problem in information technology primarily because the widely used ASCII character set did not include representation for them.The term smart quotes is from the name in several word processors of function aimed this problem automatically converting straight quotes typed by the user into curved quotes the feature attempts to be smart enough to determine whether the punctuation marked opening or closing. Since curved quotes are the typographically correct ones word processors have traditionally offered curved quotes to users at minimum as available characters. Before Unicode was widely accepted and supported this meant representing the curved quotes in whatever 8-bit encoding the software and underlying operating system was using. The character sets for Windows and Macintosh used two different pairs of values for curved quotes while ISO 8859-1 historically the default character set for the Unixes and older Linux systems has no curved quotes making cross-platform and -application compatibility difficult. Performance by these smart quotes features was far from perfect overall variance potential by e.g. subject matter formatting/style convention user typing habits. As many word processors including Microsoft Word and OpenOffice.org have the function enabled by default users may not have realized that the ASCII-compatible straight quotes they were typing on their keyboards ended up as something different conversely users could incorrectly assume its functioning in other applications e.g. composing emails. The curved apostrophe is the same character as the closing single quote. Smart quotes features wrongly convert initial apostrophes as in 't is 'em 'til and '89 into opening single quotes. An example of this error appears in the advertisements for the television show 'Til Death. The two very different functions of this character can cause confusion particularly in British styles in which single quotes are the standard primary. Unicode support has since become the norm for operating systems. Thus in at least some cases transferring content containing curved quotes or any other non-ASCII characters from word processor to another application or platform has been less troublesome provided all steps in the process including the clipboard if applicable are Unicode-aware. But there are still applications which still use the older character sets or output data using them and thus problems still occur. There are other considerations for including curved quotes in the widely used markup languages HTML XML and SGML. If the encoding of the document supports direct representation of the characters they can be used but doing so can cause difficulties if the document needs to be edited by someone who is using an editor that can not support the encoding. For example many simple text editors only handle few encodings or assume that the encoding of any file opened is platform default so the quote characters may appear as the generic replacement character or mojibake gibberish. HTML includes set of entities for curved quotes lsquo left single rsquo right single or apostrophe sbquo low single ldquo left double rdquo right double and bdquo low double. XML does not define these by default but specifications based on it can do so and XHTML does. In addition while the HTML XHTML and XML specifications allow specifying numeric character references in either hexadecimal or decimal SGML and older versions of HTML and many old implementations only support decimal references. Thus to represent curly quotes in XML and SGML it is safest to use the decimal numeric character references. That is to represent the double curly quotes use 8220 and 8221 and to represent single curly quotes use 8216 and 8217. Both numeric and named references function correctly in almost every modern browser. While using numeric references can make page more compatible with outdated browsers using named references are safer for systems that handle multiple character encodings i.e. RSS aggregators and search results. In Windows file and folder names the straight double quotation mark is prohibited as it is reserved character. The curved quotation marks as well as the straight single quotation mark are permitted. Usenet and email The style of quoting known as Usenet quoting uses the greater-than sign prepended to line of text to mark it as quote. This convention was later standardized in RFC 3676 and was adopted subsequently by many email clients when automatically including quoted text from previous messages in plain text mode. Unicode code point table In Unicode 30 characters are marked Quotation Mark=Yes by character property. They all have general category Punctuation and subcategory Open Close Initial Final or Other Ps Pe Pi Pf Po. Several other Unicode characters with quotation mark semantics lack the character property.

Empty string,In formal language theory the empty string or empty word is the unique string of length zero.,In formal language theory the empty string or empty word is the unique string of length zero. Formal theory Formally string is finite ordered sequence of characters such as letters digits or spaces. The empty string is the special case where the sequence has length zero so there are no symbols in the string. There is only one empty string because two strings are only different if they have different lengths or different sequence of symbols. In formal treatments the empty string is denoted with or sometimes or. The empty string should not be confused with the empty language which is formal language i.e. set of strings that contains no strings not even the empty string. The empty string has several properties |ε|. Its string length is zero. s. The empty string is the identity element of the concatenation operation. The set of all strings forms free monoid with respect to and ε. εR. Reversal of the empty string produces the empty string. The empty string precedes any other string under lexicographical order because it is the shortest of all strings.In context-free grammars production rule that allows symbol to produce the empty string is known as an ε-production and the symbol is said to be nullable. Use in programming languages In most programming languages strings are data type. Strings are typically stored at distinct memory addresses locations. Thus the same string for example the empty string may be stored in two or more places in memory. In this way there could be multiple empty strings in memory in contrast with the formal theory definition for which there is only one possible empty string. However string comparison function would indicate that all of these empty strings are equal to each other. Even string of length zero can require memory to store it depending on the format being used. In most programming languages the empty string is distinct from null reference or null pointer because null reference points to no string at all not even the empty string. The empty string is legitimate string upon which most string operations should work. Some languages treat some or all of the following in similar ways empty strings null references the integer the floating point number the Boolean value false the ASCII character NUL or other such values. The empty string is usually represented similarly to other strings. In implementations with string terminating character null-terminated strings or plain text lines the empty string is indicated by the immediate use of this terminating character. Examples of empty strings The empty string is syntactically valid representation of zero in positional notation in any base which does not contain leading zeros. Since the empty string does not have standard visual representation outside of formal language theory the number zero is traditionally represented by single decimal digit instead. Zero-filled memory area interpreted as null-terminated string is an empty string. Empty lines of text show the empty string. This can occur from two consecutive EOLs as often occur in text files and this is sometimes used in text processing to separate paragraphs e.g. in MediaWiki.

String literal,string literal or anonymous string is literal for string value in the source code of computer program. Modern programming languages commonly use quoted sequence of characters formally bracketed delimiters as in foo where foo is string literal with value foo. Methods such as escape sequences can be used to avoid the problem of delimiter collision issues with brackets and allow the delimiters to be embedded in string. There are many alternate notations for specifying string literals especially in complicated cases. The exact notation depends on the programming language in question. Nevertheless there are general guidelines that most modern programming languages follow.,string literal or anonymous string is literal for string value in the source code of computer program.

Nevertheless there are general guidelines that most modern programming languages follow. Syntax Bracketed delimiters Most modern programming languages use bracket delimiters also balanced delimiters to specify string literals. Double quotations are the most common quoting delimiters used Hi There. An empty string is literally written by pair of quotes with no character at all in between Some languages either allow or mandate the use of single quotations instead of double quotations the string must begin and end with the same kind of quotation mark and the type of quotation mark may or may not give slightly different semantics 'Hi There. These quotation marks are unpaired the same character is used as an opener and closer which is hangover from the typewriter technology which was the precursor of the earliest computer input and output devices. In terms of regular expressions basic quoted string literal is given as This means that string literal is written as quote followed by zero one or more non-quote characters followed by quote. In practice this is often complicated by escaping other delimiters and excluding newlines. ==== Paired delimiters ==== number of languages provide for paired delimiters where the opening and closing delimiters are different. These also often allow nested strings so delimiters can be embedded so long as they are paired but still result in delimiter collision for embedding an unpaired closing delimiter. Examples include PostScript which uses parentheses as in The quick brown fox and m4 which uses the backtick as the starting delimiter and the apostrophe as the ending delimiter. Tcl allows both quotes for interpolated strings and braces for raw strings as in The quick brown fox or The quick brown fox this derives from the single quotations in Unix shells and the use of braces in for compound statements since blocks of code is in Tcl syntactically the same thing as string literals that the delimiters are paired is essential for making this feasible. The Unicode character set includes paired separate opening and closing versions of both single and double quotations Hi There Hi There Hi There Hi There These however are rarely used as many programming languages will not register them one exception is the paired double quotations which can be used in Visual Basic .NET. Unpaired marks are preferred for compatibility as they are easier to type on wide range of keyboards and so even in languages where they are permitted many projects forbid their use for source code. Whitespace delimiters String literals might be ended by newlines. One example is MediaWiki template parameters. Navbox |name=Nulls |title= wikt Null|Nulls in computing There might be special syntax for multi-line strings. In YAML string literals may be specified by the relative positioning of whitespace and indentation. No delimiters Some programming languages such as Perl and PHP allow string literals without any delimiters in some contexts. In the following Perl program for example red green and blue are string literals but are unquoted Perl treats non-reserved sequences of alphanumeric characters as string literals in most contexts. For example the following two lines of Perl are equivalent Declarative notation In the original FORTRAN programming language for example string literals were written in so-called Hollerith notation where decimal count of the number of characters was followed by the letter and then the characters of the string This declarative notation style is contrasted with bracketed delimiter quoting because it does not require the use of balanced bracketed characters on either side of the string. Advantages eliminates text searching for the delimiter character and therefore requires significantly less overhead avoids the problem of delimiter collision enables the inclusion of metacharacters that might otherwise be mistaken as commands can be used for quite effective data compression of plain text stringsDrawbacks this type of notation is error-prone if used as manual entry by programmers special care is needed in case of multi byte encodingsThis is however not drawback when the prefix is generated by an algorithm as is most likely the case. Constructor functions C++ has two styles of string one inherited from delimited by and the safer std :string in the C++ Standard Library. The std :string class is frequently used in the same way string literal would be used in other languages and is often preferred to C-style strings for its greater flexibility and safety. But it comes with performance penalty for string literals as std :string usually allocates memory dynamically and must copy the C-style string literal to it at run time. Before C++11 there was no literal for C++ strings C++11 allows this is C++ string with the at the end of the literal so the normal constructor syntax was used for example std :string str initializer syntax std :string str converting constructor syntax std :string str string explicit constructor syntax all of which have the same interpretation. Since C++11 there is also new constructor syntax std :string str uniform initializer syntax auto str constexpr literal syntax Delimiter collision When using quoting if one wishes to represent the delimiter itself in string literal one runs into the problem of delimiter collision. For example if the delimiter is double quote one can not simply represent double quote itself by the literal as the second quote is interpreted as the end of the string literal not as the value of the string and similarly one can not write This is in quotes but invalid. as the middle quoted portion is instead interpreted as outside of quotes. There are various solutions the most general-purpose of which is using escape sequences such as or This is in quotes\ and properly escaped. but there are many other solutions. Paired quotes such as braces in Tcl allow nested strings such as foo bar zork but do not otherwise solve the problem of delimiter collision since an unbalanced closing delimiter can not simply be included as in. Doubling up number of languages including Pascal BASIC DCL Smalltalk SQL and Fortran avoid delimiter collision by doubling up on the quotation marks that are intended to be part of the string literal itself Dual quoting Some languages such as Fortran Modula-2 JavaScript Python and PHP allow more than one quoting delimiter in the case of two possible delimiters this is known as dual quoting. Typically this consists of allowing the programmer to use either single quotations or double quotations interchangeably each literal must use one or the other. This does not allow having single literal with both delimiters in it however. This can be worked around by using several literals and using string concatenation Python has string literal concatenation so consecutive string literals are concatenated even without an operator so this can be reduced to supports few quoting delimiters with such strings starting with and ending with or similarly for other delimiter character any of or. also supports here document-style strings via similar syntax. In some programming languages such as sh and Perl there are different delimiters that are treated differently such as doing string interpolation or not and thus care must be taken when choosing which delimiter to use see different kinds of strings below. Multiple quoting further extension is the use of multiple quoting which allows the author to choose which characters should specify the bounds of string literal. For example in Perl all produce the desired result. Although this notation is more flexible few languages support it other than Perl Ruby influenced by Perl and C++11 also support these. In C++11 raw strings can have various delimiters beginning with delimiter and end with delimiter. The delimiter can be from zero to 16 characters long and may contain any member of the basic source character set except whitespace characters parentheses or backslash. variant of multiple quoting is the use of here document-style strings. Lua as of 5.1 provides limited form of multiple quoting particularly to allow nesting of long comments or embedded strings. Normally one uses and to delimit literal strings initial newline stripped otherwise raw but the opening brackets can include any number of equal signs and only closing brackets with the same number of signs close the string. For example Multiple quoting is particularly useful with regular expressions that contain usual delimiters such as quotes as this avoids needing to escape them. An early example is sed where in the substitution command s/regex/replacement/ the default slash delimiters can be replaced by another character as in regex replacement. Constructor functions Another option which is rarely used in modern languages is to use function to construct string rather than representing it via literal. This is generally not used in modern languages because the computation is done at run time rather than at parse time. For example early forms of BASIC did not include escape sequences or any other workarounds listed here and thus one instead was required to use the CHR function which returns string containing the character corresponding to its argument. In ASCII the quotation mark has the value 34 so to represent string with quotes on an ASCII system one would write In similar facility is available via sprintf and the character format specifier though in the presence of other workarounds this is generally not used These constructor functions can also be used to represent nonprinting characters though escape sequences are generally used instead. similar technique can be used in C++ with the std :string stringification operator. Escape sequences Escape sequences are general technique for representing characters that are otherwise difficult to represent directly including delimiters nonprinting characters such as backspaces newlines and whitespace characters which are otherwise impossible to distinguish visually and have long history. They are accordingly widely used in string literals and adding an escape sequence either to single character or throughout string is known as escaping. One character is chosen as prefix to give encodings for characters that are difficult or impossible to include directly. Most commonly this is backslash in addition to other characters key point is that backslash itself can be encoded as double backslash \\ and for delimited strings the delimiter itself can be encoded by escaping say by for. regular expression for such escaped strings can be given as follows as found in the ANSI specification \\.| ^\\ meaning quote followed by zero or more of either an escaped character backslash followed by something possibly backslash or quote or non-escape non-quote character ending in quote the only issue is distinguishing the terminating quote from quote preceded by backslash which may itself be escaped. Multiple characters can follow the backslash such as \uFFFF depending on the escaping scheme. An escaped string must then itself be lexically analyzed converting the escaped string into the unescaped string that it represents. This is done during the evaluation phase of the overall lexing of the computer language the evaluator of the lexer of the overall language executes its own lexer for escaped string literals. Among other things it must be possible to encode the character that normally terminates the string constant plus there must be some way to specify the escape character itself. Escape sequences are not always pretty or easy to use so many compilers also offer other means of solving the common problems. Escape sequences however solve every delimiter problem and most compilers interpret escape sequences. When an escape character is inside string literal it means this is the start of the escape sequence. Every escape sequence specifies one character which is to be placed directly into the string. The actual number of characters required in an escape sequence varies. The escape character is on the top/left of the keyboard but the editor will translate it therefore it is not directly tapeable into string. The backslash is used to represent the escape character in string literal. Many languages support the use of metacharacters inside string literals. Metacharacters have varying interpretations depending on the context and language but are generally kind of 'processing command for representing printing or nonprinting characters. For instance in string literal if the backslash is followed by letter such as or then this represents nonprinting backspace newline or tab character respectively. Or if the backslash is followed by 1-3 octal digits then this sequence is interpreted as representing the arbitrary character with the specified ASCII code. This was later extended to allow more modern hexadecimal character code notation Note Not all sequences in the list are supported by all parsers and there may be other escape sequences which are not in the list. Nested escaping When code in one programming language is embedded inside another embedded strings may require multiple levels of escaping. This is particularly common in regular expressions and SQL query within other languages or other languages inside shell scripts. This double-escaping is often difficult to read and author. Incorrect quoting of nested strings can present security vulnerability. Use of untrusted data as in data fields of an SQL query should use prepared statements to prevent code injection attack. In PHP through 5.3 there was feature called magic quotes which automatically escaped strings for convenience and security but due to problems was removed from version 5.4 onward. Raw strings few languages provide method of specifying that literal is to be processed without any language-specific interpretation. This avoids the need for escaping and yields more legible strings. Raw strings are particularly useful when common character needs to be escaped notably in regular expressions nested as string literals where backslash is widely used and in DOS/Windows paths where backslash is used as path separator. The profusion of backslashes is known as leaning toothpick syndrome and can be reduced by using raw strings. Compare escaped and raw pathnames in Extreme examples occur when these are combined Uniform Naming Convention paths begin with \\ and thus an escaped regular expression matching UNC name begins with backslashes \\\\\\\\ due to needing to escape the string and the regular expression. Using raw strings reduces this to escaping in the regular expression as in \\\\. In XML documents CDATA sections allows use of characters such as and without an XML parser attempting to interpret them as part of the structure of the document itself. This can be useful when including literal text and scripting code to keep the document well formed. Multiline string literals In many languages string literals can contain literal newlines spanning several lines. Alternatively newlines can be escaped most often as \n. For example and are both valid bash producing foo bar Languages that allow literal newlines include bash Lua Perl PHP and Tcl. In some other languages string literals can not include newlines. Two issues with multiline string literals are leading and trailing newlines and indentation. If the initial or final delimiters are on separate lines there are extra newlines while if they are not the delimiter makes the string harder to read particularly for the first line which is often indented differently from the rest. Further the literal must be unindented as leading whitespace is preserved this breaks the flow of the code if the literal occurs within indented code. The most common solution for these problems is here document-style string literals. Formally speaking here document is not string literal but instead stream literal or file literal. These originate in shell scripts and allow literal to be fed as input to an external command. The opening delimiter is END where END can be any word and the closing delimiter is END on line by itself serving as content boundary the is due to redirecting stdin from the literal. Due to the delimiter being arbitrary these also avoid the problem of delimiter collision. These also allow initial tabs to be stripped via the variant syntax -END though leading spaces are not stripped. The same syntax has since been adopted for multiline string literals in number of languages most notably Perl and are also referred to as here documents and retain the syntax despite being strings and not involving redirection. As with other string literals these can sometimes have different behavior specified such as variable interpolation. Python whose usual string literals do not allow literal newlines instead has special form of string designed for multiline literals called triple quoting. These use tripled delimiter either or. These literals are especially used for inline documentation known as docstrings. Tcl allows literal newlines in strings and has no special syntax to assist with multiline strings though delimiters can be placed on lines by themselves and leading and trailing newlines stripped via string trim while string map can be used to strip indentation. String literal concatenation few languages provide string literal concatenation where adjacent string literals are implicitly joined into single literal at compile time. This is feature of C++ Ruby and Python which copied it from C. Notably this concatenation happens at compile time during lexical analysis as phase following initial tokenization and is contrasted with both run time string concatenation generally with the operator and concatenation during constant folding which occurs at compile time but in later phase after phrase analysis or parsing. Most languages such as Java and Perl do not support implicit string literal concatenation and instead require explicit concatenation such as with the operator this is also possible in and Python but illegal in C/C++ see below in this case concatenation may happen at compile time via constant folding or may be deferred to run time. Motivation In where the concept and term originate string literal concatenation was introduced for two reasons To allow long strings to span multiple lines with proper indentation in contrast to line continuation which destroys the indentation scheme and To allow the construction of string literals by macros via stringizing .In practical terms this allows string concatenation in early phases of compilation translation specifically as part of lexical analysis without requiring phrase analysis or constant folding. For example the following are valid C/C++ However the following are invalid This is because string literals have array type char or const char C++ which can not be added this is not restriction in most other languages. This is particularly important when used in combination with the preprocessor to allow strings to be computed following preprocessing particularly in macros. As simple example will if the file is called a.c expand to which is then concatenated being equivalent to common use case is in constructing printf or scanf format strings where format specifiers are given by macros.A more complex example uses stringification of integers by the preprocessor to define macro that expands to sequence of string literals which are then concatenated to single string literal with the file name and line number Beyond syntactic requirements of C/C++ implicit concatenation is form of syntactic sugar making it simpler to split string literals across several lines avoiding the need for line continuation via backslashes and allowing one to add comments to parts of strings. For example in Python one can comment regular expression in this way Problems Implicit string concatenation is not required by modern compilers which implement constant folding and causes hard-to-spot errors due to unintentional concatenation from omitting comma particularly in vertical lists of strings as in Accordingly it is not used in most languages and it has been proposed for deprecation from and Python. However removing the feature breaks backwards compatibility and replacing it with concatenation operator introduces issues of precedence string literal concatenation occurs during lexing prior to operator evaluation but concatenation via an explicit operator occurs at the same time as other operators hence precedence is an issue potentially requiring parentheses to ensure desired evaluation order. subtler issue is that in and C++ there are different types of string literals and concatenation of these has implementation-defined behavior which poses potential security risk. Different kinds of strings Some languages provide more than one kind of literal which have different behavior. This is particularly used to indicate raw strings no escaping or to disable or enable variable interpolation but has other uses such as distinguishing character sets. Most often this is done by changing the quoting character or adding prefix or suffix. This is comparable to prefixes and suffixes to integer literals such as to indicate hexadecimal numbers or long integers. One of the oldest examples is in shell scripts where single quotes indicate raw string or literal string while double quotes have escape sequences and variable interpolation. For example in Python raw strings are preceded by an or compare \\Windows with \Windows though Python raw string can not end in an odd number of backslashes. Python also distinguishes two types of strings 8-bit ASCII bytes strings the default explicitly indicated with or prefix and Unicode strings indicated with or prefix. while in Python strings are Unicode by default and bytes are separate bytes type that when initialized with quotes must be prefixed with b. 's notation for raw strings is called -quoting. While this disables escaping it allows double-up quotes which allow one to represent quotes within the string C++11 allows raw strings unicode strings UTF-8 UTF-16 and UTF-32 and wide character strings determined by prefixes. It also adds literals for the existing C++ string which is generally preferred to the existing C-style strings. In Tcl brace-delimited strings are literal while quote-delimited strings have escaping and interpolation. Perl has wide variety of strings which are more formally considered operators and are known as quote and quote-like operators. These include both usual syntax fixed delimiters and generic syntax which allows choice of delimiters these include REXX uses suffix characters to specify characters or strings using their hexadecimal or binary code. E.g. all yield the space character avoiding the function call X2C 20. String interpolation In some languages string literals may contain placeholders referring to variables or expressions in the current context which are evaluated usually at run time. This is referred to as variable interpolation or more generally string interpolation. Languages that support interpolation generally distinguish strings literals that are interpolated from ones that are not. For example in sh-compatible Unix shells as well as Perl and Ruby double-quoted quotation-delimited strings are interpolated while single-quoted apostrophe-delimited strings are not. Non-interpolated string literals are sometimes referred to as raw strings but this is distinct from raw string in the sense of escaping. For example in Python string prefixed with or has no escaping or interpolation normal string no prefix has escaping but no interpolation and string prefixed with or has escaping and interpolation. For example the following Perl code produces the output Nancy said Hello World to the crowd of people. In this case the metacharacter character not to be confused with the sigil in the variable assignment statement is interpreted to indicate variable interpolation and requires some escaping if it needs to be outputted literally. This should be contrasted with the printf function which produces the same output using notation such as but does not perform interpolation the is placeholder in printf format string but the variables themselves are outside the string. This is contrasted with raw strings which produce output like name said greeting to the crowd of people. Here the characters are not metacharacters and are not interpreted to have any meaning other than plain text. Embedding source code in string literals Languages that lack flexibility in specifying string literals make it particularly cumbersome to write programming code that generates other programming code. This is particularly true when the generation language is the same or similar to the output language. For example writing code to produce quines generating an output language from within web template using XSLT to generate XSLT or SQL to generate more SQL generating PostScript representation of document for printing purposes from within document-processing application written in or some other language. writing shadersNevertheless some languages are particularly well-adapted to produce this sort of self-similar output especially those that support multiple options for avoiding delimiter collision. Using string literals as code that generates other code may have adverse security implications especially if the output is based at least partially on untrusted user input. This is particularly acute in the case of Web-based applications where malicious users can take advantage of such weaknesses to subvert the operation of the application for example by mounting an SQL injection attack.

The film is primarily two-hander with the only other characters appearing incidentally or offscreen. Reception Critical response James Hadfield of The Japan Times praised the actors convincing chemistry and found the film managed to be explicit without being gratuitous with welcome frankness in the film depictions of sex noting common theme of people surrendering to private passion in the face of more momentous events beyond their control with Arai 's previous work. James Marsh of the South China Morning Post was less kind calling the film an interminable bore and stating Nothing remotely arousing is created during the numerous sex scenes which are interspersed with dollops of pseudointellectual gibberish.

The unusual title of the story which includes both the quotation marks and dashes shown above is quotation from sentence near the end of the story the quotation is taken from the middle of the sentence hence the dashes indicating elided text before and after the title. Plot '—All You Zombies— chronicles young man later revealed to be intersex taken back in time and tricked into impregnating his younger female self before he underwent sexual reassignment surgery he turns out to be the offspring of that union with the paradoxical result that he is his own mother and father. As the story unfolds all the major characters are revealed to be the same person at different stages of their life. Narrative order of events The story involves an intricate series of time-travel journeys see diagram. It begins with young man speaking to the narrator the Bartender in 1970. The two of them relate in that both of them are from unmarried parents. The Bartender remarks that no one in his family ever gets married including him. He wears an Ouroboros ring. The young man is called the Unmarried Mother because he writes stories for confession magazines many of them presumably from the point of view of an unmarried mother. Cajoled by the Bartender the Unmarried Mother explains why he understands the female viewpoint so well he was born girl in 1945 and raised in an orphanage. While fairly ugly teenager in 1963 she was seduced impregnated and abandoned by an older man. During the delivery of her child doctors discovered she was intersex with internalized male sex organs as well as female sex organs. Complications during delivery by Caesarean section rendered the female organs unviable and the physicians gave her gender reassignment. The baby was kidnapped by mysterious older gentleman and not seen again. The Unmarried Mother then had to adjust to life as man despite an upbringing that left him unqualified for men 's jobs he had planned to get into space as sex worker for male workers and colonists. Instead he used his secretarial skills to type manuscripts and eventually began writing. Professing sympathy the Bartender offers to take him to the abandoning seducer whom the Unmarried Mother wishes revenge on. The Bartender guides him into back room where he Bartender uses time machine to take them to 1963 and sets the young man loose. The Bartender goes forward eleven months kidnaps one-month-old baby and takes her to 1945 leaving her at an orphanage. He returns to 1963 one month later and picks up the Unmarried Mother who was instinctively attracted to his younger female self and has seduced and impregnated her. The Bartender nudges him to connect the dots and realize that the seducer the young woman the baby and the time traveler are all him. The Bartender then drops the Unmarried Mother in 1985 at an outpost of the Temporal Bureau time-traveling secret police force that manipulates events in history to protect the human race. He has just created and recruited himself. Finally the Bartender returns to 1970 arriving short time after he left the bar. He allows customer to play 'm My Own Grandpa on the jukebox having yelled at the customer for playing the song before he left. Closing the bar he time travels again to his home base in 1993. As he beds down for much-deserved rest he contemplates the scar left over from the Caesarean section performed when he gave birth to his daughter father mother and entire history. He thinks know where came from—but where did all you zombies come from. Chronological order of events As the story is told as disjointed point of view reference by several other points thereafter this is the actual chronological history of Jane according to the story although the story itself is still classic example of time paradox. On September 20 1945 the Bartender drops off baby Jane at an orphanage. She grows up there. She dreams of joining one of the comfort organizations dedicated to providing for spacemen. Nearly 18 years later the man who refers to himself as an unmarried mother is dropped off on April 1963 by the Bartender. He meets and after some weeks of dating seduces and impregnates the 17-year-old Jane who has an intersex condition. From Jane 's point of view he then disappears. Actually he has been retrieved by the Bartender and taken to 1985 see sixth bullet point. Jane learns that she is pregnant by the now-missing unknown man. On waking after giving birth by C-section she is told she is intersex and has two full sets of reproductive organs of which the female organs have developed fully allowing her to have child. She is told the female organs have been severely damaged by the pregnancy and birth she learns that she has been subjected without her consent to sex change using her male reproductive set which reassigns her sex to male. On March 10 1964 the Bartender kidnaps the baby and takes it back in time to the orphanage see first bullet point. Jane now male becomes stenographer and then writer. Whenever he is asked his occupation he replies somewhat truculently 'm an unmarried mother—at four cents word. write confession stories. He becomes regular at the bar where the narrator the Bartender works but does not interact with him significantly for six years. On November 1970 the Bartender meets the Unmarried Mother yells at the customer playing 'm My Own Grandpa conducts the Unmarried Mother into the back office and takes him back to 1963 to find and ostensibly get revenge upon the man who got him pregnant see second bullet point. He returns to the bar seconds after going into the back room and allows the customer to play the song. From his own point of view he has carried out his mission of ensuring his own existence. On August 12 1985 the Bartender travels to 1963 and retrieves the Unmarried Mother -- whom he had left there then. during the events of the fifth and second bullet point -- to the Rockies base and enlists him actually younger version of himself in the Temporal Bureau. On January 12 1993 the Bartender who is also Jane/mother/father/Unmarried Mother arrives back at his base from 1970 to think about his life. Reception Philosopher David Lewis considered '—All You Zombies—' and By His Bootstraps to be examples of perfectly consistent time travel stories. Stating that it and other Heinlein time-travel stories force the reader into contemplations of the nature of causality and the arrow of time Carl Sagan listed All You Zombies as an example of how science fiction can convey bits and pieces hints and phrases of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader.

The story is about mathematically inclined architect named Quintus Teal who has what he thinks is brilliant idea to save on real estate costs by building house shaped like the unfolded net of tesseract. The title is paraphrased from the nursery rhyme There Was Crooked Man. Plot summary Quintus Teal Graduate Architect in the Los Angeles area wants architects to be inspired by topology and the Picard–Vessiot theory. During conversation with friend Homer Bailey he shows models made of toothpicks and clay representing projections of four-dimensional tesseract the equivalent of cube and convinces Bailey to build one. The house is quickly constructed in an inverted double cross shape having eight cubical rooms arranged as stack of four cubes with further four cubes surrounding the second cube up on the stack. The night before Teal is to show Bailey and his wife Matilda around the house an earthquake occurs. The three of them arrive the next morning to find what appears to be just single cubical room. Inside they find the upper floors completely intact but the stairs seem to form closed loop. As all the doors and windows lead directly into other spaces there seems to be no way to get back out. At one point they look down hallway and are shocked to see their own backs. Teal realizes that the earthquake caused the house to fold into an actual tesseract. In attempting to move from one room to another by way of French window Teal falls outside and lands in shrubbery. Exploring further they find that the windows of the original top room do not connect where they mathematically should. One gives dizzying view from above the Empire State Building another an upside-down view of seascape. third window looks out on place of no-space with no color not even black. The fourth window looks out on an unearthly desert scene. Just then another earthquake hits and so they exit in panic through the open window. They find themselves in desert with twisted tree-like vegetation around them with no sign of the house or the window they just jumped through. They are relieved when they discover from passing truck driver that they are in Joshua Tree National Park. Returning to the house they find it has vanished. Teal remarks that it must 've fell through into another section of space on the last earthquake and that he should 've anchored it at the foundations. The story ends with Teal rejoicing that he 's now got great new revolutionary idea for house and Mr. Bailey attempting to punch him out of frustration which Teal quickly evades as he was always man of action. Address The story gives Quintus Teal 's address as 8775 Lookout Mountain Avenue in Hollywood 34°06′33″N 118°23′05″W across the street from the Hermit the original Hermit of Hollywood. That address is across the street from Heinlein 's own house at the time the story was written. Reception Stating that it was for many readers the first introduction to four-dimensional geometry that held any promise of comprehensibility Carl Sagan in 1978 listed —And He Built Crooked House— as an example of how science fiction can convey bits and pieces hints and phrases of knowledge unknown or inaccessible to the reader.

Helen Hooven Santmyer,Helen Hooven Santmyer November 25 1895 February 21 1986 was an American writer educator and librarian. She is primarily known for her best-selling epic ... And Ladies of the Club published when she was in her 80s.,Helen Hooven Santmyer November 25 1895 February 21 1986 was an American writer educator and librarian. She is primarily known for her best-selling epic ... And Ladies of the Club published when she was in her 80s. Life and career Early life and education Santmyer was born on November 25 1895 in Cincinnati Ohio the oldest child of Joseph Wright and Bertha Hooven Santmyer. Her father had been medical student in Cincinnati but in 1900 switched to business and moved to the Hooven family home in Xenia Ohio taking position with the R.A. Kelly Company rope manufacturer. Inspired by Louisa May Alcott Santmyer was determined to become writer and kept diary from age 10. She also derived inspiration from her grandfathers both were veterans of the American Civil War and would relate stories of their service. She furthermore derived negative inspiration from her mother who she felt sacrificed promising career as an artist for the sake of marriage and children and was determined never to marry.As child Santmyer had severe case of undulant fever. She recovered but was left weakened for life and sometimes subject to bed confinement with fevers or heart flutter. She would always find it difficult to work and write at the same time.She was brought up Presbyterian. Her mother and grandmother were regular church attendees. In later years she no longer believed in doctrine and did not attend services.She attended Wellesley College 1914–18 and was active in the struggle for women 's rights she began publishing her poetry as an undergraduate. The 1916 Alfred Noyes edited collection Book of Princeton Verse poems by Princeton students was widely read in Santmyer 's circle and strongly influenced her. She quit her clubs and committees and wrote manifesto that appeared in The Wellesley College Magazine May 1917 criticizing women who do not dedicate themselves to their art the way she presumed men did.After graduation Santmeyer took job as an editorial secretary with Scribner 's in New York City for two years. She returned to Xenia teaching locally and at Wellesley College during which time she wrote her first novel Herbs and Apples based on her life in Xenia college and working for Scribner 's. After Wellesley Santmyer attended Oxford University in England for three years 1924–27. During her time there she met and befriended fellow Xenian the poet Ridgely Torrence. She wrote thesis on British women writers focusing largely on Clara Reeve who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries. Culminating her studies at Oxford Santmyer was awarded B.Litt. degree.After finishing at Oxford Santmyer returned to Xenia. In 1927 she befriended Mildred Sandoe librarian who would become her literary assistant and later her life partner until Mildred 's death almost fifty years later. In 1928 she joined the Xenia Woman 's Club. During this time she wrote her second novel The Fierce Dispute published in 1929. In the summer of 1930 Santmyer became MacDowell colonist. There she wrote her third novel Farewell Summer published posthumously and befriended actor and playwright Daniel Reed and novelist Thornton Wilder.The Depression forced the closure of the rope factory where Santmyer 's father worked. He found employment in Orange County California the house was sold and the family relocated to the West Coast. While in California Santmyer started writing Ohio Town and Ladies. But after three years her father retired due to failing health. Santmyer and her parents returned to near Xenia. Main career In 1935 she accepted the positions as Dean of Women and English department head at Cedarville College in Cedarville Ohio then chartered as Reformed Presbyterian college. During this time her writing continued but because of her health very slowly. In 1953 Cedarville College was purchased by Baptist association which demanded faculty to adhere to their Biblical literalism and did not permit smoking or drinking. Santmyer resigned from the faculty.Santmyer and her parents moved back to the former Hooven family home which had been repurchased by her brother-in-law. Santmyer 's friend Sandoe then working at the Dayton Public Library found position there for Santmyer as research librarian and provided the daily commute. Santmyer 's father died in 1954 and her mother died in 1955. Sandoe then moved into the Santmyer house. Retirement and main writing Upon retirement in 1959 Santmyer returned to full-time writing publishing Ohio Town reminiscences of Xenia in 1962 with Ohio State University Press. The director of OSU Press encouraged her to publish with them again. Santmyer then wrote the bulk of Ladies submitting it to OSU Press in 1976 which accepted it but required heavy abridgment. Also as of 1976 Santmyer had the first of several stays in Hospitality Home East Xenia nursing home where most of the revision was done.In 1982 ... And Ladies of the Club was published obscurely by OSU Press it was the publisher 's second novel there was no separate advertising budget and only few hundred copies of the book were sold mostly to Ohio libraries. By April 1983 nearly blind and suffering from emphysema Santmyer moved permanently into the nursing home. By chance the novel ended up being read by some in the Hollywood entertainment industry who saw its potential for larger audience.

Both Santmyer and the novel subsequently received considerable media attention with the novel becoming best-seller.Santmyer died at age 90 on February 21 1986.The former Hooven family home on 113 West 3rd Street Xenia has been marked with an Ohio Historical Marker by the Ohio Historical Connection.

Over the course of the band the personnel has shifted numerous times around the artistic leadership of Walter. The music ranges from intense all-acoustic free improvisation to complex and modernistic rock composition electronic noise to punk-inspired jazz. Walter has been quoted as drawing inspiration from the fields of punk death metal free jazz and no wave.Walter moved to the San Francisco Bay Area in 2003 where he reformed The Flying Luttenbachers with the addition of bassist Mike Green guitarist Ed Rodrigues and later Mick Barr. The Flying Luttenbachers officially disbanded in 2007. In 2017 after ten-year hiatus an incarnation of The Flying Luttenbachers with Walter on drums joined by guitarist Chris Welcome and bassist Tim Dahl played several shows in France. In 2019 quartet arrangement of the band released Shattered Dimension with Walter on drums joined by saxophonist Matt Nelson and bassist Tim Dahl.

Over the next several years the varying lineup also included bassist Evan Lipson guitarist Brandon Seabrook guitarist Henry Kaiser guitarist Wendy Eisenberg guitarist Katie Battistoni guitarist Alex Ward and drummer Sam Ospovat. History The Flying Luttenbachers formed in December 1991 in Chicago Illinois as punk jazz trio with Hal Russell tenor and soprano saxes trumpet vibraphone drums co founder Chad Organ tenor sax moog synthesizer baritone sax and Weasel Walter drums guitar bass keyboards woodwinds electronics main composer. The band derived their moniker from Russell 's birthname Harold Luttenbacher. Russell left the band in June 1992 and was soon replaced by Ken Vandermark for the recording of The Flying Luttenbachers first 7″ record. The band has since featured frequently shifting cast of free jazz and experimental rock musicians including Fred Lonberg-Holm Kurt Johnson Jeb Bishop Alex Perkolup Mick Barr Ed Rodriguez Mike Green and Jonathan Hischke. The Flying Luttenbachers have toured Europe and the US extensively with bands like The Locust Arab On Radar Lightning Bolt U.S. Maple Erase Errata Bobby Conn and Wolf Eyes. Walter moved from Chicago to Oakland California in 2003 beginning yet another incarnation of the group. The live band played their final concert in November 2006. The Flying Luttenbachers project officially ceased operation in November 2007 upon the release of final studio album recorded solo by Walter. In 2017 the band reformed for tour in France invited by the Sonic Protest festival. The newest incarnation of the group appeared opening three shows for Oh Sees at Warsaw in Brooklyn NY on October 17–19. Conceptual continuity Since 1996 Revenge album the Flying Luttenbachers musical output has been underlined by gradually unravelling storyline concerning the self-obliteration of the planet Earth and the resulting aftermath. The 2006 album Cataclysm concerns an interstellar battle between two monolithic entities The Void dark silent spectre detailed on 2004 album of the same name and The Iridescent Behemoth massive planetoid being whose tale was told on 2003 complex Systems Emerge From Complete Disorder album. The music energetically utilizes deliberate harmonic dissonance and the material operates on principle of intelligent transformation of concise amounts of interrelated themes.

Helen Hooven Santmyer,Helen Hooven Santmyer November 25 1895 February 21 1986 was an American writer educator and librarian. She is primarily known for her best-selling epic ... And Ladies of the Club published when she was in her 80s.,Helen Hooven Santmyer November 25 1895 February 21 1986 was an American writer educator and librarian. She is primarily known for her best-selling epic ... And Ladies of the Club published when she was in her 80s. Life and career Early life and education Santmyer was born on November 25 1895 in Cincinnati Ohio the oldest child of Joseph Wright and Bertha Hooven Santmyer. Her father had been medical student in Cincinnati but in 1900 switched to business and moved to the Hooven family home in Xenia Ohio taking position with the R.A. Kelly Company rope manufacturer. Inspired by Louisa May Alcott Santmyer was determined to become writer and kept diary from age 10. She also derived inspiration from her grandfathers both were veterans of the American Civil War and would relate stories of their service. She furthermore derived negative inspiration from her mother who she felt sacrificed promising career as an artist for the sake of marriage and children and was determined never to marry.As child Santmyer had severe case of undulant fever. She recovered but was left weakened for life and sometimes subject to bed confinement with fevers or heart flutter. She would always find it difficult to work and write at the same time.She was brought up Presbyterian. Her mother and grandmother were regular church attendees. In later years she no longer believed in doctrine and did not attend services.She attended Wellesley College 1914–18 and was active in the struggle for women 's rights she began publishing her poetry as an undergraduate. The 1916 Alfred Noyes edited collection Book of Princeton Verse poems by Princeton students was widely read in Santmyer 's circle and strongly influenced her. She quit her clubs and committees and wrote manifesto that appeared in The Wellesley College Magazine May 1917 criticizing women who do not dedicate themselves to their art the way she presumed men did.After graduation Santmeyer took job as an editorial secretary with Scribner 's in New York City for two years. She returned to Xenia teaching locally and at Wellesley College during which time she wrote her first novel Herbs and Apples based on her life in Xenia college and working for Scribner 's. After Wellesley Santmyer attended Oxford University in England for three years 1924–27. During her time there she met and befriended fellow Xenian the poet Ridgely Torrence. She wrote thesis on British women writers focusing largely on Clara Reeve who lived in the 18th and 19th centuries. Culminating her studies at Oxford Santmyer was awarded B.Litt. degree.After finishing at Oxford Santmyer returned to Xenia. In 1927 she befriended Mildred Sandoe librarian who would become her literary assistant and later her life partner until Mildred 's death almost fifty years later. In 1928 she joined the Xenia Woman 's Club. During this time she wrote her second novel The Fierce Dispute published in 1929. In the summer of 1930 Santmyer became MacDowell colonist. There she wrote her third novel Farewell Summer published posthumously and befriended actor and playwright Daniel Reed and novelist Thornton Wilder.The Depression forced the closure of the rope factory where Santmyer 's father worked. He found employment in Orange County California the house was sold and the family relocated to the West Coast. While in California Santmyer started writing Ohio Town and Ladies. But after three years her father retired due to failing health. Santmyer and her parents returned to near Xenia. Main career In 1935 she accepted the positions as Dean of Women and English department head at Cedarville College in Cedarville Ohio then chartered as Reformed Presbyterian college. During this time her writing continued but because of her health very slowly. In 1953 Cedarville College was purchased by Baptist association which demanded faculty to adhere to their Biblical literalism and did not permit smoking or drinking. Santmyer resigned from the faculty.Santmyer and her parents moved back to the former Hooven family home which had been repurchased by her brother-in-law. Santmyer 's friend Sandoe then working at the Dayton Public Library found position there for Santmyer as research librarian and provided the daily commute. Santmyer 's father died in 1954 and her mother died in 1955. Sandoe then moved into the Santmyer house. Retirement and main writing Upon retirement in 1959 Santmyer returned to full-time writing publishing Ohio Town reminiscences of Xenia in 1962 with Ohio State University Press. The director of OSU Press encouraged her to publish with them again. Santmyer then wrote the bulk of Ladies submitting it to OSU Press in 1976 which accepted it but required heavy abridgment. Also as of 1976 Santmyer had the first of several stays in Hospitality Home East Xenia nursing home where most of the revision was done.In 1982 ... And Ladies of the Club was published obscurely by OSU Press it was the publisher 's second novel there was no separate advertising budget and only few hundred copies of the book were sold mostly to Ohio libraries. By April 1983 nearly blind and suffering from emphysema Santmyer moved permanently into the nursing home.

The current stable version iOS 16 was released to the public on September 12 2022. History In 2005 when Steve Jobs began planning the iPhone he had choice to either shrink the Mac which would be an epic feat of engineering or enlarge the iPod. Jobs favored the former approach but pitted the Macintosh and iPod teams led by Scott Forstall and Tony Fadell respectively against each other in an internal competition with Forstall winning by creating the iPhone OS. The decision enabled the success of the iPhone as platform for third-party developers using well-known desktop operating system as its basis allowed the many third-party Mac developers to write software for the iPhone with minimal retraining. Forstall was also responsible for creating software development kit for programmers to build iPhone apps as well as an App Store within iTunes.The operating system was unveiled with the iPhone at the Macworld Conference Expo on January 2007 and released in June of that year. At the time of its unveiling in January Steve Jobs claimed iPhone runs OS and runs desktop class applications but at the time of the iPhone 's release the operating system was renamed iPhone OS. Initially third-party native applications were not supported. Jobs reasoning was that developers could build web applications through the Safari web browser that would behave like native apps on the iPhone. In October 2007 Apple announced that native Software Development Kit SDK was under development and that they planned to put it in developers hands in February. On March 2008 Apple held press event announcing the iPhone SDK. The iOS App Store was opened on July 10 2008 with an initial 500 applications available. This quickly grew to 3,000 in September 2008 15,000 in January 2009 50,000 in June 2009 100,000 in November 2009 250,000 in August 2010 650,000 in July 2012 million in October 2013 million in June 2016 and 2.2 million in January 2017. As of March 2016 million apps are natively compatible with the iPad tablet computer. These apps have collectively been downloaded more than 130 billion times. App intelligence firm Sensor Tower estimated that the App Store would reach million apps by 2020.In September 2007 Apple announced the iPod Touch redesigned iPod based on the iPhone form factor. On January 27 2010 Apple introduced their much-anticipated media tablet the iPad featuring larger screen than the iPhone and iPod Touch and designed for web browsing media consumption and reading and offering multi-touch interaction with multimedia formats including newspapers e-books photos videos music word processing documents video games and most existing iPhone apps using 9.7-inch screen. It also includes mobile version of Safari for web browsing as well as access to the App Store iTunes Library iBookstore Contacts and Notes. Content is downloadable via Wi-Fi and optional 3G service or synced through the user 's computer. AT was initially the sole U.S. provider of 3G wireless access for the iPad.In June 2010 Apple rebranded iPhone OS as iOS. The trademark IOS had been used by Cisco for over decade for its operating system IOS used on its routers. To avoid any potential lawsuit Apple licensed the IOS trademark from Cisco.The Apple Watch smartwatch was announced by Tim Cook on September 2014 being introduced as product with health and fitness-tracking. It was released on April 24 2015. It uses watchOS as its operating system watchOS is based on iOS with new features created specially for the Apple Watch such as an activity tracking app. On November 22 2016 five-second video file originally named IMG_0942.MP4 started crashing iOS on an increasing count of devices forcing users to reboot. It gained massive popularity through social media channels and messaging services. In October 2016 Apple opened its first iOS Developer Academy in Naples inside University of Naples Federico II 's new campus. The course is completely free aimed at acquiring specific technical skills on the creation and management of applications for the Apple ecosystem platforms. At the academy there are also issues of business administration business planning and business management with focus on digital opportunities and there is path dedicated to the design of graphical interfaces. Students have the opportunity to participate in the Enterprise Track an in-depth training experience on the entire life cycle of an app from design to implementation to security troubleshooting data storage and cloud usage. As of 2020 the academy graduated almost thousand students from all over the world who have worked on 400 app ideas and have already published about 50 apps on the iOS App Store. In the 2018–2019 academic year students from more than 30 countries arrived. 35 of these have been selected to attend the Worldwide Developer Conference the annual Apple Developer Conference held annually in California in early June. On June 2019 iPadOS the branded version of iOS for iPad was announced at the 2019 WWDC it was launched on September 25 2019. Features Interface The iOS user interface is based upon direct manipulation using multi-touch gestures such as swipe tap pinch and reverse pinch. Interface control elements include sliders switches and buttons. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device one common result is the undo command or rotating it in three dimensions one common result is switching between portrait and landscape mode. Various accessibility described in Accessibility functions enable users with vision and hearing disabilities to properly use iOS.iOS devices boot to the homescreen the primary navigation and information hub on iOS devices analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. iOS homescreens are typically made up of app icons and widgets app icons launch the associated app whereas widgets display live auto-updating content such as weather forecast the user 's email inbox or news ticker directly on the homescreen.Along the top of the screen is status bar showing information about the device and its connectivity. The status bar itself contains two elements the Control Center and the Notification Center. The Control Center can be pulled down from the top right of the notch on the new iPhones giving access to various toggles to manage the device more quickly without having to open the Settings. It is possible to manage brightness volume wireless connections music player etc.Instead scrolling from the top left to the bottom will open the Notification Center which in the latest versions of iOS is very similar to the lockscreen. It displays notifications in chronological order and groups them by application. From the notifications of some apps it is possible to interact directly for example by replying message directly from it. Notifications are sent in two modes the important notifications that are displayed on the lock screen and signaled by distinctive sound accompanied by warning banner and the app badge icon and the secondary mode where they are displayed in the Notification Center but they are not shown on the lock screen nor are they indicated by warning banners badge icons or sounds.On earlier iPhones with home button screenshots can be created with the simultaneous press of the home and power buttons. In comparison to Android OS which requires the buttons to be held down short press does suffice on iOS. On the more recent iPhones which lack physical home button screenshots are captured using the volume-up and power buttons instead.The camera application used skeuomorphic closing camera shutter animation prior to iOS. Since then it uses simple short blackout effect. Notable additions over time include HDR photography and the option to save both normal and high dynamic range photographs simultaneously where the former prevents ghosting effects from moving objects since iPhone iOS automatic HDR adjustment iOS 7.1 live photo with short video bundled to each photo if enabled iPhone 6s iOS and digital zoom shortcut iPhone Plus iOS 10. Some camera settings such as video resolution and frame rate are not adjustable through the camera interface itself but are outsourced to the system settings.A new feature in iOS 13 called context menus shows related actions when you touch and hold an item. When the context menu is displayed the background is blurred.To choose from few options selection control is used. Selectors can appear anchored at the bottom or in line with the content called date selectors. Date selectors take on the appearance of any other selection control but with column for day month and optionally year. Alerts appear in the center of the screen but there are also alerts that scroll up from the bottom of the screen called action panels. Destructive actions such as eliminating any element are colored red. The official font of iOS is San Francisco. It is designed for small text readability and is used throughout the operating system including third-party apps.The icons are 180x180px in size for iPhones with larger screen usually models over inches including iPhone 11 Pro and iPhone Plus while it 's 120x120px on iPhones with smaller displays. Applications iOS devices come with preinstalled apps developed by Apple including Mail Maps TV Music FaceTime Wallet Health and many more. Applications apps are the most general form of application software that can be installed on iOS. They are downloaded from the official catalog of the App Store digital store where apps are subjected to security checks before being made available to users. In June 2017 Apple updated its guidelines to specify that app developers will no longer have the ability to use custom prompts for encouraging users to leave reviews for their apps. IOS applications can also be installed directly from an IPA file provided by the software distributor via unofficial ways. They are written using iOS Software Development Kit SDK and often combined with Xcode using officially supported programming languages including Swift and Objective-C. Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages. Applications for iOS are mostly built using components of UIKit programming framework. It allows applications to have consistent look and feel with the OS nevertheless offering customization. Elements automatically update along with iOS updates automatically including new interface rules. UIKit elements are very adaptable this allows developers to design single app that looks the same on any iOS device. In addition to defining the iOS interface UIKit defines the functionality of the application. At first Apple did not intend to release an SDK to developers because they did not want third-party apps to be developed for iOS building web apps instead. However this technology never entered into common use this led Apple to change its opinion so in October 2007 the SDK for developers was announced finally released on March 2008. The SDK includes an inclusive set of development tools including an audio mixer and an iPhone simulator. It is free download for Mac users. It is not available for Microsoft Windows PCs. To test the application get technical support and distribute applications through App Store developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program. Over the years the Apple Store apps surpassed multiple major milestones including 50,000 100,000 250,000 500,000 million and million apps. The billionth application was installed on April 24 2009. Home screen The home screen rendered by SpringBoard displays application icons and dock at the bottom where users can pin their most frequently used apps. The home screen appears whenever the user unlocks the device presses the physical Home button while in an app or swipes up from the bottom of the screen using the home bar. Before iOS on the iPhone 3GS or later the screen 's background could be customized only through jailbreaking but can now be changed out-of-the-box. The screen has status bar across the top to display data such as time battery level and signal strength. The rest of the screen is devoted to the current application. When passcode is set and user switches on the device the passcode must be entered at the Lock Screen before access to the Home screen is granted.In iPhone OS Spotlight was introduced allowing users to search media apps emails contacts messages reminders calendar events and similar content. In iOS and later Spotlight is accessed by pulling down anywhere on the home screen except for the top and bottom edges that open Notification Center and Control Center. In iOS there are two ways to access Spotlight. As with iOS and pulling down on any homescreen will show Spotlight. However it can also be accessed as it was in iOS versions through. This endows Spotlight with Siri suggestions which include app suggestions contact suggestions and news. In iOS 10 Spotlight is at the top of the now-dedicated Today panel.Since iOS 3.2 users are able to set background image for the Home Screen. This feature is only available on third-generation devices—iPhone 3GS third-generation iPod Touch iOS 4.0 or newer and all iPad models since iOS 3.2 —or newer.iOS introduced parallax effect on the Home Screen which shifts the device 's wallpaper and icons in response to the movement of the device creating 3D effect and an illusion of floating icons. This effect is also visible in the tab view of Mail and Safari.Researchers found that users organize icons on their homescreens based on usage frequency and relatedness of the applications as well as for reasons of usability and aesthetics. ==== System font ==== iOS originally used Helvetica as the system font. Apple switched to Helvetica Neue exclusively for the iPhone and its Retina Display and retained Helvetica as the system font for older iPhone devices on iOS. With iOS Apple announced that they would change the system font to Helvetica Neue Light decision that sparked criticism for inappropriate usage of light thin typeface for low-resolution mobile screens. Apple eventually chose Helvetica Neue instead. The release of iOS also introduced the ability to scale text or apply other forms of text accessibility changes through Settings. With iOS Apple changed the font to San Francisco an Apple-designed font aimed at maximum legibility and font consistency across its product lineup. ==== Folders ==== iOS introduced folders which can be created by dragging an application on top of another and from then on more items can be added to the folder using the same procedure. title for the folder is automatically selected by the category of applications inside but the name can also be edited by the user. When apps inside folders receive notification badges the individual numbers of notifications are added up and the total number is displayed as notification badge on the folder itself. Originally folders on an iPhone could include up to 12 apps while folders on iPad could include 20. With increasing display sizes on newer iPhone hardware iOS updated the folders with pages similar to the home screen layout allowing for significant expansion of folder functionality. Each page of folder can contain up to nine apps and there can be 15 pages in total allowing for total of 135 apps in single folder. In iOS Apple updated folder sizes for iPad hardware allowing for 16 apps per page still at 15 pages maximum increasing the total to 240 apps. ==== Notification Center ==== Before iOS notifications were delivered in modal window and could n't be viewed after being dismissed. In iOS Apple introduced Notification Center which allows users to view history of notifications. The user can tap notification to open its corresponding app or clear it. Notifications are now delivered in banners that appear briefly at the top of the screen. If user taps received notification the application that sent the notification will be opened. Users can also choose to view notifications in modal alert windows by adjusting the application 's notification settings. Introduced with iOS widgets are now accessible through the Notification Center defined by 3rd parties.When an app sends notification while closed red badge appears on its icon. This badge tells the user at glance how many notifications that app has sent. Opening the app clears the badge. Accessibility iOS offers various accessibility features to help users with vision and hearing disabilities. One major feature VoiceOver provides voice reading information on the screen including contextual buttons icons links and other user interface elements and allows the user to navigate the operating system through gestures. Any apps with default controls and developed with UIKit framework gets VoiceOver functionality built in. One example includes holding up the iPhone to take photo with VoiceOver describing the photo scenery. As part of Made for iPhone program introduced with the release of iOS in 2013 Apple has developed technology to use Bluetooth and special technology protocol to let compatible third-party equipment connect with iPhones and iPads for streaming audio directly to user 's ears. Additional customization available for Made for iPhone products include battery tracking and adjustable sound settings for different environments. Apple made further efforts for accessibility for the release of iOS 10 in 2016 adding new pronunciation editor to VoiceOver adding Magnifier setting to enlarge objects through the device 's camera software TTY support for deaf people to make phone calls from the iPhone and giving tutorials and guidelines for third-party developers to incorporate proper accessibility functions into their apps.In 2012 Liat Kornowski from The Atlantic wrote that the iPhone has turned out to be one of the most revolutionary developments since the invention of Braille and in 2016 Steven Aquino of TechCrunch described Apple as leading the way in assistive technology with Sarah Herrlinger Senior Manager for Global Accessibility Policy and Initiatives at Apple stating that We see accessibility as basic human right. Building into the core of our products supports vision of an inclusive world where opportunity and access to information are barrier-free empowering individuals with disabilities to achieve their goals .Criticism has been aimed at iOS depending on both internet connection either WiFi or through iTunes and working SIM card upon first activation. This restriction has been loosened in iOS 12 which no longer requires the latter. Multitasking Multitasking for iOS was first released in June 2010 along with the release of iOS. Only certain devices—iPhone iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch 3rd generation—were able to multitask. The iPad did not get multitasking until iOS 4.2.1 in that November.The implementation of multitasking in iOS has been criticized for its approach which limits the work that applications in the background can perform to limited function set and requires application developers to add explicit support for it.Before iOS multitasking was limited to selection of the applications Apple included on the device. Users could however jailbreak their device in order to unofficially multitask. Starting with iOS on third-generation and newer iOS devices multitasking is supported through seven background APIs Background audio application continues to run in the background as long as it is playing audio or video content Voice over IP application is suspended when phone call is not in progress Background location application is notified of location changes Push notifications Local notifications application schedules local notifications to be delivered at predetermined time Task completion application asks the system for extra time to complete given task Fast app switching application does not execute any code and may be removed from memory at any timeIn iOS three new background APIs were introduced Newsstand application can download content in the background to be ready for the user External Accessory application communicates with an external accessory and shares data at regular intervals Bluetooth Accessory application communicates with bluetooth accessory and shares data at regular intervalsIn iOS Apple introduced new multitasking feature providing all apps with the ability to perform background updates. This feature prefers to update the user 's most frequently used apps and prefers to use Wi-Fi networks over cellular network without markedly reducing the device 's battery life. ==== Switching applications ==== In iOS 4.0 to iOS 6.x double-clicking the home button activates the application switcher. scrollable dock-style interface appears from the bottom moving the contents of the screen up. Choosing an icon switches to an application. To the far left are icons which function as music controls rotation lock and on iOS 4.2 and above volume controller. With the introduction of iOS double-clicking the home button also activates the application switcher. However unlike previous versions it displays screenshots of open applications on top of the icon and horizontal scrolling allows for browsing through previous apps and it is possible to close applications by dragging them up similar to how WebOS handled multiple cards.With the introduction of iOS the application switcher received significant visual change while still retaining the card metaphor introduced in iOS the application icon is smaller and appears above the screenshot which is now larger due to the removal of Recent and Favorite Contacts and each application card overlaps the other forming rolodex effect as the user scrolls. Now instead of the home screen appearing at the leftmost of the application switcher it appears rightmost. In iOS 11 the application switcher receives major redesign. In the iPad the Control Center and app switcher are combined. The app switcher in the iPad can also be accessed by swiping up from the bottom. In the iPhone the app switcher can not be accessed if there are no apps in the RAM. ==== Ending tasks ==== In iOS 4.0 to iOS 6.x briefly holding the icons in the application switcher makes them jiggle similarly to the homescreen and allows the user to force quit the applications by tapping the red minus circle that appears at the corner of the app 's icon. Clearing applications from multitasking stayed the same from iOS 4.0 through 6.1.6 the last version of iOS. As of iOS the process has become faster and easier. In iOS instead of holding the icons to close them they are closed by simply swiping them upwards off the screen. Up to three apps can be cleared at time compared to one in versions up to iOS 6.1.6. ==== Task completion ==== Task completion allows apps to continue certain task after the app has been suspended. As of iOS 4.0 apps can request up to ten minutes to complete task in the background. This does n't extend to background uploads and downloads though e.g. if user starts download in one application it wo n't finish if they switch away from the application. Siri Siri is an intelligent personal assistant integrated into iOS. The assistant uses voice queries and natural language user interface to answer questions make recommendations and perform actions by delegating requests to set of Internet services. The software adapts to users individual language usages searches and preferences with continuing use. Returned results are individualized. Originally released as an app for iOS in February 2010 it was acquired by Apple two months later and then integrated into iPhone 4S at its release in October 2011. At that time the separate app was also removed from the iOS App Store.Siri supports wide range of user commands including performing phone actions checking basic information scheduling events and reminders handling device settings searching the Internet navigating areas finding information on entertainment and is able to engage with iOS-integrated apps. With the release of iOS 10 in 2016 Apple opened up limited third-party access to Siri including third-party messaging apps as well as payments ride-sharing and Internet calling apps. With the release of iOS 11 Apple updated Siri 's voices for more clear human voices it now supports follow-up questions and language translation and additional third-party actions. Game Center Game Center is an online multiplayer social gaming network released by Apple. It allows users to invite friends to play game start multiplayer game through matchmaking track their achievements and compare their high scores on leaderboard. iOS and above adds support for profile photos.Game Center was announced during an iOS preview event hosted by Apple on April 2010. preview was released to registered Apple developers in August. It was released on September 2010 with iOS 4.1 on iPhone iPhone 3GS and iPod Touch 2nd generation through 4th generation. Game Center made its public debut on the iPad with iOS 4.2.1. There is no support for the iPhone 3G original iPhone and the first-generation iPod Touch the latter two devices did not have Game Center because they did not get iOS. However Game Center is unofficially available on the iPhone 3G via hack. Hardware The main hardware platform for iOS is the ARM architecture the ARMv7 ARMv8-A ARMv8.2-A ARMv8.3-A. iOS releases before iOS can only be run on iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors ARMv6 and ARMv7-A architectures. In 2013 iOS was released with full 64-bit support which includes native 64-bit kernel libraries drivers as well as all built-in applications after Apple announced that they were switching to 64-bit ARMv8-A processors with the introduction of the Apple A7 chip. 64-bit support was also enforced for all apps in the App Store All new apps submitted to the App Store with deadline of February 2015 and all app updates submitted to the App Store with deadline of June 2015. iOS 11 drops support for all iOS devices with 32-bit ARM processors as well as 32-bit applications making iOS 64-bit only. Supported locales iOS has support for many locales. Notes The iPod Touch at its launch supported English French German Japanese Dutch Italian Spanish Portuguese Danish Finnish Norwegian Swedish Korean Simplified Chinese Traditional Chinese Russian and Polish. However most of these languages were not available in the iPhone until iPhone 2.0. As of iOS users can add more than one locale to use on the device. If one language is not supported the next one is used instead. The language on the top of the list is the primary one. While these regions are present in iOS they fall back to the generic regions for the system language. This issue has been resolved in iOS and later when default region is added. de-AT de-CH de en-CA en-US en es-ES es es-419 es-MX fr-CH fr iOS and above improved the locale handling process now applying default region to those that have multiple regions. The region is not displayed in the locale name if the region is the same as the country/region setting or if only one region is added for language. German German Germany English English US Spanish Spanish Spain French French France Italian Italian Italy Dutch Dutch Netherlands Portuguese Portuguese Brazil Chinese Traditional Chinese Traditional Taiwan Dutch Belgium was previously shown as Flemish in iOS before being fixed in iOS 10 to bring it more in line with other locales. iOS 10 and macOS Sierra were the last versions in which new locales were added for the languages supported by iOS and macOS. Two new languages Bulgarian and Kazakh were added in iOS 16 and macOS Ventura. English US United States Canada English UK United Kingdom Ireland Singapore South Africa English Australia Australia New Zealand English India India Chinese Simplified China mainland Chinese Traditional Taiwan Taiwan Chinese Traditional Hong Kong Hong Kong Macau Japanese Japan Spanish Spain Spain Spanish Latin America Latin America Argentina Bolivia Chile Colombia Costa Rica Dominican Republic Ecuador El Salvador Guatemala Honduras Mexico Nicaragua Panama Paraguay Peru Puerto Rico Uruguay US Venezuela French France France Belgium Switzerland French Canada Canada German Germany Austria Switzerland Russian Russia Portuguese Brazil Brazil Portuguese Portugal Portugal Italian Italy Switzerland Korean South Korea Turkish Turkey Dutch Netherlands Belgium Arabic Saudi Arabia Thai Thailand Swedish Sweden Danish Denmark Vietnamese Vietnam Norwegian Bokmål Norway Polish Poland Finnish Finland Indonesian Indonesia Hebrew Israel Greek Greece Romanian Romania Hungarian Hungary Czech Czech Republic Catalan Spain Slovak Slovakia Ukrainian Ukraine Croatian Croatia Malay Malaysia Hindi India It is possible to add custom locales in the iOS Simulator by editing the AppleLanguages portion of the .GlobalPreferences.plist file for each simulator. Development The iOS SDK Software Development Kit allows for the development of mobile apps on iOS. While originally developing iPhone prior to its unveiling in 2007 Apple 's then-CEO Steve Jobs did not intend to let third-party developers build native apps for iOS instead directing them to make web applications for the Safari web browser. However backlash from developers prompted the company to reconsider with Jobs announcing in October 2007 that Apple would have software development kit available for developers by February 2008. The SDK was released on March 2008.The SDK is free download for users of Mac personal computers. It is not available for Microsoft Windows PCs. The SDK contains sets giving developers access to various functions and services of iOS devices such as hardware and software attributes. It also contains an iPhone simulator to mimic the look and feel of the device on the computer while developing. New versions of the SDK accompany new versions of iOS. In order to test applications get technical support and distribute apps through App Store developers are required to subscribe to the Apple Developer Program.Combined with Xcode the iOS SDK helps developers write iOS apps using officially supported programming languages including Swift and Objective-C. Other companies have also created tools that allow for the development of native iOS apps using their respective programming languages. Update history schedule Apple provides major updates to the iOS operating system annually via iTunes and since iOS also over-the-air. The device checks an XML-based PLIST file on mesu.apple.com for updates. Updates are delivered as unencrypted ZIP files. Updates are checked for regularly and are downloaded and installed automatically if enabled. Otherwise the user can install them manually or are prompted to allow automatic installation overnight if plugged in and connected to Wi-Fi. iPod Touch users originally had to pay for system software updates due to accounting rules that designated it not subscription device like the iPhone or Apple TV causing many iPod Touch owners not to update. In September 2009 change in accounting rules won tentative approval affecting Apple 's earnings and stock price and allowing iPod Touch updates to be delivered free of charge.Apple significantly extended the cycle of updates for iOS-supported devices over the years. The iPhone 1st generation and iPhone 3G only received two iOS updates while later models had support for five six and seven years. XNU kernel The iOS kernel is the XNU kernel of Darwin. The original iPhone OS 1.0 up to iPhone OS 3.1.3 used Darwin 9.0.0d1. iOS was based on Darwin 10. iOS was based on Darwin 11. iOS was based on Darwin 13. iOS and iOS are based on Darwin 14. iOS is based on Darwin 15. iOS 10 is based on Darwin 16. iOS 11 is based on Darwin 17. iOS 12 is based on Darwin 18. iOS 13 is based on Darwin 19. iOS 14 is based on Darwin 20. iOS 15 is based on Darwin 21. iOS 16 is based on Darwin 22.In iOS the kernel is subject to ASLR similar to that of OS Mountain Lion. This makes exploit possibilities more complex since it is not possible to know the location of kernel code. Apple has made the XNU kernel open source. The source is under 3-clause BSD license for the original BSD parts with parts added by Apple under the Apple Public Source License. The versions contained in iOS are not available only the versions used in macOS are available. iOS does not have kernel extensions kexts in the file system even if they are actually present. The kernel cache can be decompressed to show the correct kernel along with the kexts all packed in the __PRELINK_TEXT section and their plists in the __PRELINK_INFO section. The kernel cache can also be directly decompressed if decrypted using third-party tools. With the advent of iOS 10 betas and default plain text kernelcaches these tools can only be used after unpacking and applying lzssdec to unpack the kernel cache to its full size. The kextstat provided by the Cydia alternative software does not work on iOS because the kextstat is based on kmod_get_info ... which is deprecated API in iOS and Mac OS Snow Leopard. There are other alternative software that can also dump raw XML data. On developing devices the kernel is always stored as statically linked cache stored in /System/Library/Caches/com.apple.kernelcaches/kernelcache which is unpacked and executed at boot. In the beginning iOS had kernel version usually higher than the corresponding version of macOS. Over time the kernels of iOS and macOS have gotten closer. This is not surprising considering that iOS introduced new features such as the ASLR Kernel the default freezer and various security-strengthening features that were first incorporated and subsequently arrived on macOS. It appears Apple is gradually merging the iOS and macOS kernels over time. The build date for each version varies slightly between processors. This is due to the fact that the builds are sequential. Kernel Image The kernel image base is randomized by the boot loader iBoot. This is done by creating random data doing SHA-1 hash of it and then using byte from the SHA-1 hash for the kernel slide. The slide is calculated with this formula base=0x01000000+ slide_byte 0x00200000 If the slide is the static offset of 0x21000000 is used instead. The adjusted base is passed to the kernel in the boot arguments structure at offset 0x04 which is equivalent to gBootArgs- virtBase. Kernel Map The kernel map is used for kernel allocations of all types kalloc kernel_memory_allocate etc. and spans all of kernel space 0x80000000-0xFFFEFFFF. The kernel based maps are submaps of the kernel_map for example zone_map ipc_kernel_map etc. The strategy is to randomize the base of the kernel_map. random 9-bit value is generated right after kmem_init which establishes kernel_map is multiplied by the page size. The resulting value is used as the size for the initial kernel_map allocation. Future kernel_map and submap allocations are pushed forward by random amount. The allocation is silently removed after the first garbage collection and reused. This behaviour can be overridden with the kmapoff boot parameter. Attacks Kext_request allows applications to request information about kernel modules divided into active and passive operations. Active operations load unload start stop etc. require root access. iOS removes the ability to load kernel extensions. Passive operations were originally before iOS unrestricted and allowed unprivileged users to query kernel module base addresses. iOS6 inadvertently removed some limitations only the load address requests are disallowed. So attackers can use kKextRequestPredicateGetLoaded to get load addresses and mach-o header dumps. The load address and mach-o segment headers are obscured to hide the ASLR slide but mach-o section headers are not. This reveals the virtual addresses of loaded kernel sections. This information leak has been closed with iOS 6.0.1. Versions codenames Internally iOS identifies each version by codename often used internally only normally to maintain secrecy of the project. For example the codename for iOS 14 is Azul. Jailbreaking Since its initial release iOS has been subject to variety of different hacks centered around adding functionality not allowed by Apple. Prior to the 2008 debut of Apple 's native iOS App Store the primary motive for jailbreaking was to bypass Apple 's purchase mechanism for installing the App Store 's native applications. Apple claimed that it would not release iOS software updates designed specifically to break these tools other than applications that perform SIM unlocking however with each subsequent iOS update previously un-patched jailbreak exploits are usually patched.When device is booting it loads Apple 's own kernel initially so jailbroken device must be exploited and have the kernel patched each time it is booted up. There are different types of jailbreak. An untethered jailbreak uses exploits that are powerful enough to allow the user to turn their device off and back on at will with the device starting up completely and the kernel will be patched without the help of computer in other words it will be jailbroken even after each reboot. However some jailbreaks are tethered. tethered jailbreak is only able to temporarily jailbreak the device during single boot. If the user turns the device off and then boots it back up without the help of jailbreak tool the device will no longer be running patched kernel and it may get stuck in partially started state such as Recovery Mode. In order for the device to start completely and with patched kernel it must be re-jailbroken with computer using the boot tethered feature of tool each time it is turned on. All changes to the files on the device such as installed package files or edited system files will persist between reboots including changes that can only function if the device is jailbroken such as installed package files. In more recent years two other solutions have been created semi-tethered and semi-untethered. semi-tethered solution is one where the device is able to start up on its own but it will no longer have patched kernel and therefore will not be able to run modified code. It will however still be usable for normal functions just like stock iOS. To start with patched kernel the user must start the device with the help of the jailbreak tool. semi-untethered jailbreak gives the ability to start the device on its own. On first boot the device will not be running patched kernel. However rather than having to run tool from computer to apply the kernel patches the user is able to re-jailbreak their device with the help of an app usually sideloaded using Cydia Impactor running on their device. In the case of the iOS 9.2-9.3.3 and 64-bit 10.x jailbreaks Safari-based exploits were available thereby meaning websites could be used to rejailbreak. In more detail Each iOS device has bootchain that tries to make sure only trusted/signed code is loaded. device with tethered jailbreak is able to boot up with the help of jailbreaking tool because the tool executes exploits via USB that bypass parts of that chain of trust bootstrapping to pwned no signature check iBSS iBEC or iBoot to finish the boot process. Since the arrival of Apple 's native iOS App Store and—along with it—third-party applications the general motives for jailbreaking have changed. People jailbreak for many different reasons including gaining filesystem access installing custom device themes and modifying SpringBoard. An additional motivation is that it may enable the installation of pirated apps. On some devices jailbreaking also makes it possible to install alternative operating systems such as Android and the Linux kernel. Primarily users jailbreak their devices because of the limitations of iOS. Depending on the method used the effects of jailbreaking may be permanent or temporary.In 2010 the Electronic Frontier Foundation EFF successfully convinced the U.S. Copyright Office to allow an exemption to the general prohibition on circumvention of copyright protection systems under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act DMCA. The exemption allows jailbreaking of iPhones for the sole purpose of allowing legally obtained applications to be added to the iPhone. The exemption does not affect the contractual relations between Apple and an iPhone owner for example jailbreaking voiding the iPhone warranty however it is solely based on Apple 's discretion on whether they will fix jailbroken devices in the event that they need to be repaired. At the same time the Copyright Office exempted unlocking an iPhone from DMCA 's anticircumvention prohibitions. Unlocking an iPhone allows the iPhone to be used with any wireless carrier using the same GSM or CDMA technology for which the particular phone model was designed to operate. Unlocking Initially most wireless carriers in the US did not allow iPhone owners to unlock it for use with other carriers. However AT allowed iPhone owners who had satisfied contract requirements to unlock their iPhone. Instructions to unlock the device are available from Apple but it is ultimately at the sole discretion of the carrier to authorize unlocking the device. This allows the use of carrier-sourced iPhone on other networks. Modern versions of iOS and the iPhone fully support LTE across multiple carriers wherever the phone was purchased. Programs to remove SIM lock restrictions are available but are not supported by Apple and most often not permanent unlock soft unlock which modifies the iPhone so that the baseband will accept the SIM card of any GSM carrier. SIM unlocking is not jailbreaking but jailbreak is also required for these unofficial software unlocks. The legality of software unlocking varies in each country for example in the US there is DMCA exemption for unofficial software unlocking of devices purchased before January 26 2013. Digital rights management The closed and proprietary nature of iOS has garnered criticism particularly by digital rights advocates such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation computer engineer and activist Brewster Kahle Internet-law specialist Jonathan Zittrain and the Free Software Foundation who protested the iPad 's introductory event and have targeted the iPad with their Defective by Design campaign. Competitor Microsoft via PR spokesman criticized Apple 's control over its platform.At issue are restrictions imposed by the design of iOS namely digital rights management DRM intended to lock purchased media to Apple 's platform the development model requiring yearly subscription to distribute apps developed for the iOS the centralized approval process for apps as well as Apple 's general control and lockdown of the platform itself. Particularly at issue is the ability for Apple to remotely disable or delete apps at will. Some in the tech community have expressed concern that the locked-down iOS represents growing trend in Apple 's approach to computing particularly Apple 's shift away from machines that hobbyists can tinker with and note the potential for such restrictions to stifle software innovation. Former Facebook developer Joe Hewitt protested against Apple 's control over its hardware as horrible precedent but praised iOS 's sandboxing of apps. Security and privacy iOS utilizes many security features in both hardware and software. Below are summaries of the most prominent features. Secure Boot Before fully booting into iOS there is low-level code that runs from the Boot ROM. Its task is to verify that the Low-Level Bootloader is signed by the Apple Root CA public key before running it. This process is to ensure that no malicious or otherwise unauthorized software can be run on an iOS device. After the Low-Level Bootloader finishes its tasks it runs the higher level bootloader known as iBoot. If all goes well iBoot will then proceed to load the iOS kernel as well as the rest of the operating system. Secure Enclave The Secure Enclave is coprocessor found in iOS devices part of the A7 and newer chips used for data protection Touch ID and Face ID. The purpose of the Secure Enclave is to handle keys and other info such as biometrics that is sensitive enough to not be handled by the Application Processor AP. It is isolated with hardware filter so the AP can not access it. It shares RAM with the AP but its portion of the RAM known as TZ0 is encrypted. The secure enclave itself is flashable MB AKF processor core called the secure enclave processor SEP as documented in Apple Patent Application 20130308838. The technology used is similar to ARM 's TrustZone/SecurCore but contains proprietary code for Apple KF cores in general and SEP specifically. It is also responsible for generating the UID key on A9 or newer chips that protects user data at rest.It has its own secure boot process to ensure that it is completely secure. hardware random number generator is also included as part of this coprocessor. Each device 's Secure Enclave has unique ID that is given to it when it is made and can not be changed. This identifier is used to create temporary key that encrypts the memory in this portion of the system. The Secure Enclave also contains an anti-replay counter to prevent brute force attacks.The SEP is located in the devicetree under IODeviceTree /arm-io/sep and managed by the AppleSEPManager driver.In 2020 security flaws in the SEP were discovered causing concerns about Apple devices such as iPhones. Face ID Face ID is face scanner that is embedded in the notch on iPhone models XS XS Max XR 11 11 Pro 11 Pro Max 12 12 Mini 12 Pro 12 Pro Max 13 13 Mini 13 Pro 13 Pro Max 14 and the 14 Plus. On the iPhone 14 Pro and the 14 Pro Max it is embedded in the Dynamic Island. It can be used to unlock the device make purchases and log into applications among other functions. When used Face ID only temporarily stores the face data in encrypted memory in the Secure Enclave as described above. There is no way for the device 's main processor or any other part of the system to access the raw data that is obtained from the Face ID sensor. Passcode iOS devices can have passcode that is used to unlock the device make changes to system settings and encrypt the device 's contents. Until recently these were typically four numerical digits long. However since unlocking the devices with fingerprint by using Touch ID has become more widespread six-digit passcodes are now the default on iOS with the option to switch back to four or use an alphanumeric passcode. Touch ID Touch ID is fingerprint scanner that is embedded in the home button and can be used to unlock the device make purchases and log into applications among other functions. When used Touch ID only temporarily stores the fingerprint data in encrypted memory in the Secure Enclave as described above. Like Face ID there is no way for the device 's main processor or any other part of the system to access the raw fingerprint data that is obtained from the Touch ID sensor. Address Space Layout Randomization Address Space Layout Randomization ASLR is low-level technique of preventing memory corruption attacks such as buffer overflows. It involves placing data in randomly selected locations in memory in order to make it more difficult to predict ways to corrupt the system and create exploits. ASLR makes app bugs more likely to crash the app than to silently overwrite memory regardless of whether the behavior is accidental or malicious. Non-executable memory iOS utilizes the ARM architecture 's Execute Never XN feature. This allows some portions of the memory to be marked as non-executable working alongside ASLR to prevent buffer overflow attacks including return-to-libc attacks. Encryption As mentioned above one use of encryption in iOS is in the memory of the Secure Enclave. When passcode is utilized on an iOS device the contents of the device are encrypted. This is done by using hardware AES 256 implementation that is very efficient because it is placed directly between the flash storage and RAM.iOS in combination with its specific hardware uses crypto-shredding when erasing all content and settings by obliterating all the keys in 'effaceable storage. This renders all user data on the device cryptographically inaccessible. Keychain The iOS keychain is database of login information that can be shared across apps written by the same person or organization. This service is often used for storing passwords for web applications. App security Third-party applications such as those distributed through the App Store must be code signed with an Apple-issued certificate. In principle this continues the chain of trust all the way from the Secure Boot process as mentioned above to the actions of the applications installed on the device by users. Applications are also sandboxed meaning that they can only modify the data within their individual home directory unless explicitly given permission to do otherwise. For example they can not access data owned by other user-installed applications on the device. There is very extensive set of privacy controls contained within iOS with options to control apps ability to access wide variety of permissions such as the camera contacts background app refresh cellular data and access to other data and services. Most of the code in iOS including third-party applications runs as the mobile user which does not have root privileges. This ensures that system files and other iOS system resources remain hidden and inaccessible to user-installed applications. ==== App Store bypasses ==== Companies can apply to Apple for enterprise developer certificates. These can be used to sign apps such that iOS will install them directly sometimes called sideloading without the app needing to be distributed via the App Store. The terms under which they are granted make clear that they are only to be used for companies who wish to distribute apps directly to their employees.Circa January–February 2019 it emerged that number of software developers were misusing enterprise developer certificates to distribute software directly to non-employees thereby bypassing the App Store. Facebook was found to be abusing an Apple enterprise developer certificate to distribute an application to underage users that would give Facebook access to all private data on their devices. Google was abusing an Apple enterprise developer certificate to distribute an app to adults to collect data from their devices including unencrypted data belonging to third parties. TutuApp Panda Helper AppValley and TweakBox have all been abusing enterprise developer certificates to distribute apps that offer pirated software. Network security iOS supports TLS with both low- and high-level APIs for developers. By default the App Transport Security framework requires that servers use at least TLS 1.2. However developers are free to override this framework and utilize their own methods of communicating over networks. When Wi-Fi is enabled iOS uses randomized MAC address so that devices can not be tracked by anyone sniffing wireless traffic. Two-factor authentication Two-factor authentication is an option in iOS to ensure that even if an unauthorized person knows an Apple ID and password combination they can not gain access to the account. It works by requiring not only the Apple ID and password but also verification code that is sent to an iDevice or mobile phone number that is already known to be trusted. If an unauthorized user attempts to sign in using another user 's Apple ID the owner of the Apple ID receives notification that allows them to deny access to the unrecognized device. Hardened memory allocation iOS features hardened memory allocator known as kalloc_type that was introduced in iOS 15. Since the XNU kernel is primarily written in memory unsafe languages such as and C++ kalloc_type is designed to mitigate the large amount of vulnerabilities that result from the use of these languages in the kernel. In order to achieve this kalloc_type implements mitigations such as type isolation in order to prevent type confusion and buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Ultimately the prevention of privilege escalation is intended. Reception Market share iOS is the second most popular mobile operating system in the world after Android. Sales of iPads in recent years are also behind Android while by web use proxy for all use iPads using iOS are still the most popular.By the middle of 2012 there were 410 million devices activated. At WWDC 2014 Tim Cook said 800 million devices had been sold by June 2014.During Apple 's quarterly earnings call in January 2015 the company announced that they had sold over one billion iOS devices since 2007.By late 2011 iOS accounted for 60 of the market share for smartphones and tablets. By the end of 2014 iOS accounted for 14.8 of the smartphone market and 27.6 of the tablet and two-in-one market. In February 2015 StatCounter reported iOS was used on 23.18 of smartphones and 66.25 of tablets worldwide measured by internet usage instead of sales.In the third quarter of 2015 research from Strategy Analytics showed that iOS adoption of the worldwide smartphone market was at record low 12.1 attributed to lackluster performance in China and Africa. Android accounted for 87.5 of the market with Windows Phone and BlackBerry accounting for the rest.

2340 Hathor,2340 Hathor provisional designation 1976 UA is an eccentric stony asteroid classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid. It belongs to the Aten group of asteroids and measures approximately 210 meters in diameter. Discovered by Charles Kowal in 1976 it was later named after the ancient Egyptian goddess Hathor.,"2340 Hathor provisional designation 1976 UA is an eccentric stony asteroid classified as near-Earth object and potentially hazardous asteroid. It belongs to the Aten group of asteroids and measures approximately 210 meters in diameter. Discovered by Charles Kowal in 1976 it was later named after the ancient Egyptian goddess Hathor. Discovery Hathor was discovered on 22 October 1976 by American astronomer Charles Kowal at Palomar Observatory California United States. It was independently discovered by Eleanor Helin and is named for the ancient Egyptian deity Hathor. Independent discoveries On 25 October 1976 Hathor was independently discovered by Eleanor Helin during the Palomar Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey PCAS and by William Lawrence Sebok who photographed the same field almost simultaneously using Palomars 1.22-meter Schmidt telescope. On the same day the official discoverer Charles Kowal found that Hathor had already been imaged three days earlier by Palomars 0.46-meter telescope the same instrument used by PCAS. fourth independent discovery was made several days later by Nikolai Chernykh at CrAO on the Crimean peninsula. The multiple discoveries were probably due to its very close approach distance to Earth. 20 After 2062 Aten Hathor was the second discovery of an Aten asteroid. In 1978 the third Aten 2100 Ra-Shalom was discovered. The Aten 1954 XA was already identified at Palomar in 1954 but its discovery date was later assigned to 2003-observation at Lincoln Laboratory ETS and is now known as 363505 2003 UC20. 21 Orbit and classification Being member of the Aten asteroids Hathor orbits the Sun at distance of 0.5–1.2 AU once every years and months 283 days. Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.45 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. Its observation arc begins days after its official discovery at Palomar with no precoveries taken and no prior identifications made. Its orbital solution includes non-gravitational forces. Close approaches Hathor has an Earth Minimum orbit intersection distance 0.0069 AU 1,030,000 km which corresponds to 2.7 lunar distances LD .When it was discovered in 1976 Hathor had one of its closest approaches to Earth at 0.007752 AU 1,160,000 km. On 21 October 2014 when it passed Earth at 0.048 AU or 18.8 LD it was observed 22 times by the Goldstone Deep Space Network using radar astronomy over period of 21 days from 10 to 31 October. It will pass Earth again at 0.00658 AU 984,000 km on 21 October 2069. Physical characteristics In the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy Hathor has CSU and Sq spectral type respectively. Diameter and albedo In the 1990s Dutch–American astronomer Tom Gehrels estimated Hathor 's diameter to measure approximately 300 meters assuming an albedo of 0.15. During its close approach to Earth in October 2014 team of astronomer published revised estimate of 210±30 meters for its diameter. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts this diameter and derives an albedo of 0.3331 with an absolute magnitude of 20.2. Rotation period In November 2014 American astronomer Brian Warner obtained rotational lightcurve of Hathor from photometric observations taken at the Palmer Divide Station in Colorado also see External links. Light-curve analysis gave well-defined rotation period of 3.350 hours with brightness variation of 0.11 magnitude U=3. Naming In accordance with the custom to name all members of the Aten group after Ancient Egyptian deities this minor planet is named for Hathor sky-goddess and daughter of Ra who personified the principles of joy feminine love and motherhood. The Ancient Greeks sometimes identified Hathor with the goddess Aphrodite. Naming was proposed by Eleanor Helin who also participated in the 1981-recovery. The minor planet 161 Athor is also named for Hathor. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on June 1981 M.P.C. 6060.

The chief designer was N. P. Mazur. Weight of launcher 15 tons based on PT-76 tank rocket engine 3R1 missile diameter 1.75 guidance by launcher maximum speed of launcher 35 km/h History Background At meters long between 0.7 and 1.5 meters in diameter and weighing 4-5 tons the earliest nuclear weapons were so large and heavy that they could only be carried by strategic bombers such as the United States Boeing B-29 Superfortress Convair B-36 Peacemaker and the Soviet Tupolev Tu-4. However use of these aircraft in the 1950s for nuclear strikes on forward positions of enemy troops in theatre of military operations was impractical. By the mid-1950s nuclear weapons development led to increases in their power and technical characteristics while reducing their diameters and masses and therefore creating the possibility of using them in variety of delivery vehicles. In particular tactical strike aircraft became suitable carriers but their application depended on factors including time of day weather conditions and the intensity of enemy air defenses. Additionally the response time of tactical strike aircraft was very large. Under these circumstances it became desirable to provide army units with their own means of delivering nuclear warheads. In the 1950s these means included traditional artillery pieces recoil-less rifles and unguided tactical missiles. Work was carried out on all three of these options in the United States and after some delay in the Soviet Union too. The available nuclear weapons technology did not allow the creation of sufficiently compact ammunition so artillery solutions including the American 280-mm T131 gun and Soviet 406-mm SM-54 2A3 rifled gun and 420-mm SM-58 2B1 smoothbore mortar became too heavy and clumsy the 2A3 weighed 55 tonnes the T131 weighed 75.5 tonnes. These pieces could not be towed over bridges could not navigate urban and rural streets and required lot of time to prepare for firing. In both the US and the USSR the alternative to these too-heavy artillery shells was unguided tactical rockets as carriers of nuclear weapons. The main advantages were Inertial guidance systems of the 1950s and 60s at ranges of around 30 km could achieve accuracies of only around 500–1000 CEP comparable with the accuracy of unguided rockets. The use of radio guidance was undesirable because it made the rocket vulnerable to interference. Additionally it required the establishment of guidance post on the ground or in the air. Active homing systems for marine and air targets had not yet been developed in the early 1950s let alone systems designed for ground targets. References.
300 (film),"300 is 2006 American epic historical action film based on the 1998 comic series of the same name by Frank Miller and Lynn Varley.

Plot In 479 B.C. one year after the Battle of Thermopylae Dilios hoplite in the Spartan army begins his story by depicting the life of Leonidas from childhood to kingship via Spartan doctrine. Dilios 's story continues and Persian herald arrives at the gates of Sparta demanding earth and water as token of submission to King Xerxes—the Spartans reply by throwing the envoy and his escort down into bottomless pit. Leonidas then visits the Ephors proposing strategy to drive back the numerically superior Persians through the Hot Gates. His plan involves building wall in order to funnel the Persians into narrow pass between the rocks and the sea negating the Persian advantage in numbers and giving the Greeks heavy infantry the advantage over the vast waves of Persian light infantry. The Ephors consult the Oracle who decrees that Sparta may not go to war during the Carneia. As Leonidas angrily departs an agent from Xerxes appears rewarding the Ephors for their covert support. Although the Ephors have denied him permission to mobilize Sparta 's army Leonidas gathers three hundred of his best soldiers in the guise of his personal bodyguard. They are joined along the way by force composed of few thousand Arcadians and other Greeks. At Thermopylae they construct the wall using slain Persian scouts as mortar. Stelios an elite Spartan soldier orders an enraged Persian emissary to return to his lines and warn Xerxes after cutting off his whipping arm. Meanwhile Leonidas encounters Ephialtes deformed Spartan whose parents fled Sparta to spare him certain infanticide. Ephialtes asks to redeem his father 's name by joining Leonidas army warning him of secret path the Persians could use to outflank and surround the Spartans. Though sympathetic Leonidas rejects him since his deformity physically prevents him from holding his shield high enough potentially compromising the phalanx formation. The battle begins soon after the Spartans refusal to lay down their weapons. Using the Hot Gates to their advantage as well as their superior fighting skills the Spartans repel wave after wave of the advancing Persian army. Xerxes personally approaches Leonidas and offers him wealth and power in exchange for his submission. Leonidas declines and mocks the inferior quality of Xerxes fanatical warriors. In response Xerxes sends in his elite guard the Immortals the Spartans nonetheless defeat them with few losses with slight help from the Arcadians. On the second day Xerxes sends in new waves of armies from Asia and other Persian subject states including war elephants to crush the Spartans but to no avail. Meanwhile an embittered Ephialtes defects to Xerxes to whom he reveals the secret path in exchange for wealth luxury women and Persian uniform. The Arcadians retreat upon learning of Ephialtes betrayal but the Spartans stay. Leonidas orders an injured but reluctant Dilios to return to Sparta and tell them of what has happened tale of victory. In Sparta Queen Gorgo tries to persuade the Spartan Council to send reinforcements to aid the 300. Theron corrupt politician claims that he owns the council and threatens the Queen who reluctantly submits to his sexual demands in return for his help. When Theron disgraces her in front of the council Gorgo kills him out of rage revealing within his robe bag of Xerxes gold. Acknowledging his betrayal the Council unanimously agrees to send reinforcements. On the third day the Persians led by Ephialtes traverse the secret path encircling the Spartans. Xerxes general again demands their surrender. Leonidas seemingly kneels in submission allowing Stelios to leap over him and kill the general. Angered Xerxes orders his troops to attack. Leonidas throws his spear at Xerxes which cuts across and wounds his face proving the God-King 's mortality. Leonidas and the remaining Spartans fight to the last man until they finally succumb to an arrow barrage. Dilios now back in Sparta concludes his tale before the council. Inspired by Leonidas sacrifice the Greeks mobilize. One year later the Persians face an army of 30,000 free Greeks led by vanguard of 10,000 Spartans. After one final speech commemorating the 300 Dilios now head of the Spartan Army leads them to battle against the Persians across the fields of Plataea. Cast Production Producer Gianni Nunnari was not the only person planning film about the Battle of Thermopylae director Michael Mann already planned film of the battle based on the book Gates of Fire. Nunnari discovered Frank Miller 's graphic novel 300 which impressed him enough to acquire the film rights. 300 was jointly produced by Nunnari and Mark Canton and Michael B. Gordon wrote the script. Director Zack Snyder was hired in June 2004 as he had attempted to make film based on Miller 's novel before making his debut with the remake of Dawn of the Dead. Snyder then had screenwriter Kurt Johnstad rewrite Gordon 's script for production and Frank Miller was retained as consultant and executive producer. Frank Miller 's original graphic novel 300 was inspired by the film The 300 Spartans which Miller first saw at age six.The film is shot-for-shot adaptation of the comic book similar to the film adaptation of Sin City. Snyder photocopied panels from the comic book from which he planned the preceding and succeeding shots. It was fun process for me… to have frame as goal to get to he said. Like the comic book the adaptation also used the character Dilios as narrator. Snyder used this narrative technique to show the audience that the surreal Frank Miller world of 300 was told from subjective perspective. By using Dilios gift of storytelling he was able to introduce fantasy elements into the film explaining that Dilios is guy who knows how not to wreck good story with truth. Snyder also added the subplot in which Queen Gorgo attempts to rally support for her husband. Two months of pre-production were required to create hundreds of shields spears and swords some of which were recycled from Troy and Alexander. Creatures were designed by Jordu Schell and an animatronic wolf and thirteen animatronic horses were created. The actors trained alongside the stuntmen and even Snyder joined in. Upwards of 600 costumes were created for the film as well as extensive prosthetics for various characters and the corpses of Persian soldiers. Shaun Smith and Mark Rappaport worked hand in hand with Snyder in pre-production to design the look of the individual characters and to produce the prosthetic makeup effects props weapons and dummy bodies required for the production.300 entered active production on October 17 2005 in Montreal and was shot over the course of sixty days in chronological order with budget of 60 million. Employing the digital backlot technique Snyder shot at the now-defunct Icestorm Studios in Montreal using bluescreens. Butler said that while he did not feel constrained by Snyder 's direction fidelity to the comic imposed certain limitations on his performance. Wenham said there were times when Snyder wanted to precisely capture iconic moments from the comic book and other times when he gave actors freedom to explore within the world and the confines that had been set. Headey said of her experience with the bluescreens It 's very odd and emotionally there 's nothing to connect to apart from another actor. Only one scene in which horses travel across the countryside was shot outdoors. The film was an intensely physical production and Butler pulled an arm tendon and developed foot drop.Post-production was handled by Montreal 's Meteor Studios and Hybride Technologies filled in the bluescreen footage with more than 1,500 visual effects shots. Visual effects supervisor Chris Watts and production designer Jim Bissell created process dubbed The Crush which allowed the Meteor artists to manipulate the colors by increasing the contrast of light and dark. Certain sequences were desaturated and tinted to establish different moods. Ghislain St-Pierre who led the team of artists described the effect Everything looks realistic but it has kind of gritty illustrative feel. Various computer programs including Maya RenderMan and RealFlow were used to create the spraying blood. The post-production lasted for year and was handled by total of ten special effects companies. Music In July 2005 composer Tyler Bates began work on the film describing the score as having beautiful themes on the top and large choir but tempered with some extreme heaviness. The composer had scored for test scene that the director wanted to show to Warner Bros. to illustrate the path of the project. Bates said that the score had lot of weight and intensity in the low end of the percussion that Snyder found agreeable to the film. The score was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and features the vocals of Azam Ali. standard edition and special edition of the soundtrack containing 25 tracks was released on March 2007 with the special edition containing 16-page booklet and three two-sided trading cards. The score has caused some controversy in the film composer community garnering criticism for its striking similarity to several other recent soundtracks including James Horner and Gabriel Yared 's work for the film Troy. The heaviest borrowings are said to be from Elliot Goldenthal 's 1999 score for Titus. Remember Us from 300 is identical in parts to the Finale from Titus and Returns King is similar to the cue Victorius Titus. On August 2007 Warner Bros. Pictures acknowledged in an official statement number of the music cues for the score of 300 were without our knowledge or participation derived from music composed by Academy Award-winning composer Elliot Goldenthal for the motion picture Titus. Warner Bros. Pictures has great respect for Elliot our longtime collaborator and is pleased to have amicably resolved this matter. Marketing The official 300 website was launched by Warner Bros. in December 2005. The conceptual art and Zack Snyder 's production blog were the initial attractions of the site. Later the website added video journals describing production details including comic-to-screen shots and the creatures of 300. In January 2007 the studio launched MySpace page for the film.

On January 22 2007 an exclusive trailer for the film was broadcast during prime-time television. The trailers have been credited with igniting interest in the film and contributing to its box-office success.In April 2006 Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment announced its intention to make PlayStation Portable game 300 March to Glory based on the film. Collision Studios worked with Warner Bros. to capture the style of the film in the video game which was released simultaneously with the film in the United States. The National Entertainment Collectibles Association produced series of action figures based on the film as well as replicas of weapons and armor.Warner Bros. promoted 300 by sponsoring the Ultimate Fighting Championship 's light heavyweight champion Chuck Liddell who made personal appearances and participated in other promotional activities. The studio also joined with the National Hockey League to produce 30-second TV spot promoting the film in tandem with the Stanley Cup playoffs. Release Theatrical In August 2006 Warner Bros. announced 300 's release date as March 16 2007 but in October the release was moved forward to March 2007.

Studio executives were surprised by the showing which was twice what they had expected. They credited the film 's stylized violence the strong female role of Queen Gorgo which attracted large number of women and MySpace advertising blitz. Producer Mark Canton said MySpace had an enormous impact but it has transcended the limitations of the Internet or the graphic novel. Once you make great movie word can spread very quickly. Critical response The film received standing ovation at its world premiere in front of 1,700 audience members at the Berlin International Film Festival on February 14 2007. It had been panned at press screening hours earlier where many attendees left during the showing and those who remained booed at the end.As of January 2021 on Rotten Tomatoes the film had an approval rating of 61 based on 236 reviews with an average rating of 6.10/10. The site 's critical consensus read simple-minded but visually exciting experience full of blood violence and ready-made movie quotes. As of October 2020 on Metacritic the film had an weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on 42 critics indicating mixed or average reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of A− on an A+ to scale.Some of the most unfavorable reviews came from major American newspapers. A. O. Scott of The New York Times describes 300 as about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans declaring that the Persian characters are pioneers in the art of face-piercing but that the Spartans had access to superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities. Kenneth Turan writes in the Los Angeles Times that unless you love violence as much as Spartan Quentin Tarantino or video-game-playing teenage boy you will not be endlessly fascinated. Roger Ebert gave the film out of rating writing 300 has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud. Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical such as film critic Robby Eksiel who said that moviegoers would be dazzled by the digital action but irritated by the pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters .Variety 's Todd McCarthy describes the film as visually arresting although bombastic while Kirk Honeycutt writing in The Hollywood Reporter praises the beauty of its topography colors and forms. Writing in the Chicago Sun-Times Richard Roeper acclaims 300 as the Citizen Kane of cinematic graphic novels. Empire gave the film three out of five writing Visually stunning thoroughly belligerent and as shallow as pygmy 's paddling pool this is whole heap of style tinged with just smidgen of substance. Comic Book Resources Mark Cronan found the film compelling leaving him with feeling of power from having been witness to something grand. IGN 's Todd Gilchrist acclaimed Zack Snyder as cinematic visionary and possible redeemer of modern moviemaking.

In 2009 National Review magazine ranked 300 number on its 25 Best Conservative Movies of the Last 25 Years list. Controversy Historical inaccuracies In the actual Battle of Thermopylae the Spartans had already joined an alliance with other Greek poleis against the Persians. During the Battle of Thermopylae Xerxes 's invasion of Greece coincided with Spartan religious festival the Carneia in which the Spartans were not permitted to make war. Still realizing the threat of the Persians and not wanting to appear as Persian sympathizers the Spartan government rather than Leonidas alone decided to send Leonidas with his personal 300-strong bodyguard to Thermopylae. Other Greek poleis joined the 300 Spartan men and totaled somewhere between 5,000 and 6,000 total Greek troops. The historical consensus among both ancient chroniclers and current scholars was that Thermopylae was clear Greek defeat and the Persian invasion would be pushed back only in later ground and naval battles.Since few records on the actual martial arts used by the Spartans survive aside from accounts of formations and tactics the fight choreography led by the stunt coordinator and fight choreographer Damon Caro was synthesis of different weapon arts with Filipino martial arts as the base.Paul Cartledge Professor of Greek History at Cambridge University advised the filmmakers on the pronunciation of Greek names and said that they made good use of his published work on Sparta. He praised the film for its portrayal of the Spartans heroic code and of the key role played by women in backing up indeed reinforcing the male martial code of heroic honour but he expressed reservations about its 'West goodies vs 'East baddies polarization. Cartledge wrote that he enjoyed the film but found Leonidas description of the Athenians as boy lovers ironic since the Spartans themselves incorporated institutional pederasty into their educational system.Ephraim Lytle assistant professor of Hellenistic history at the University of Toronto said that 300 selectively idealized Spartan society in problematic and disturbing fashion and portrayed the hundred nations of the Persians as monsters and non-Spartan Greeks as weak. He suggested that the film 's moral universe would have seemed as bizarre to ancient Greeks as it does to modern historians. Lytle also commented Ephialtes who betrays the Greeks is likewise changed from local Malian of sound body into Spartan outcast grotesquely disfigured troll who by Spartan custom should have been left exposed as an infant to die. Leonidas points out that his hunched back means Ephialtes can not lift his shield high enough to fight in the phalanx. This is transparent defense of Spartan eugenics and convenient given that infanticide could as easily have been precipitated by an ill-omened birthmark. Victor Davis Hanson National Review columnist and former professor of classical history at California State University Fresno wrote the foreword to 2007 reissue of the graphic novel and said that the film demonstrated specific affinity with the original material of Herodotus in that it captured the martial ethos of ancient Sparta and represents Thermopylae as clash of civilizations. He remarked that Simonides Aeschylus and Herodotus viewed Thermopylae as battle against Eastern centralism and collective serfdom which opposed the idea of the free citizen of an autonomous polis. He also said that the film portrays the battle in surreal manner and that the intent was to entertain and shock first and instruct second. Touraj Daryaee who is now Baskerville Professor of Iranian History and the Persian World at the University of California Irvine criticized the film 's use of classical sources by writing Some passages from the Classical authors Aeschylus Diodorus Herodotus and Plutarch are split over the movie to give it an authentic flavor. Aeschylus becomes major source when the battle with the monstrous human herd of the Persians is narrated in the film. Diodorus statement about Greek valor to preserve their liberty is inserted in the film but his mention of Persian valor is omitted. Herodotus fanciful numbers are used to populate the Persian army and Plutarch 's discussion of Greek women specifically Spartan women is inserted wrongly in the dialogue between the misogynist Persian ambassador and the Spartan king. Classical sources are certainly used but exactly in all the wrong places or quite naively. The Athenians were fighting sea battle during this. Robert McHenry the former editor-in-chief of Encyclopædia Britannica and the author of How to Know said that the film is an almost ineffably silly movie. Stills from the film could easily be used to promote Buns of Steel or AbMaster or ThighMaster. It 's about the romanticizing of the Spartan 'ideal process that began even in ancient times was promoted by the Romans and has survived over time while less and less resembling the actual historical Sparta. The director of 300 Zack Snyder stated in an MTV interview that the events are 90 percent accurate. It 's just in the visualization that it 's crazy ..... 've shown this movie to world-class historians who have said it 's amazing. They ca n't believe it 's as accurate as it is. Nevertheless he also said the film is an opera not documentary. That 's what say when people say it 's historically inaccurate. He was also quoted in BBC News story as saying that the film is at its core fantasy film. He also describes the film 's narrator Dilios as guy who knows how not to wreck good story with truth. In an interview the 300 writer Frank Miller he stated The inaccuracies almost all of them are intentional. took those chest plates and leather skirts off of them for reason. wanted these guys to move and wanted 'em to look good. knocked their helmets off fair amount partly so you can recognize who the characters are. Spartans in full regalia were almost indistinguishable except at very close angle. Another liberty took was they all had plumes but only gave plume to Leonidas to make him stand out and identify him as king. was looking for more an evocation than history lesson. The best result can hope for is that if the movie excites someone they 'll go explore the histories themselves. Because the histories are endlessly fascinating Dr. Kaveh Farrokh in the paper The 300 Movie Separating Fact from Fiction noted that the film falsely portrayed the Greco-Persian Wars in binary terms the democratic good rational 'Us versus the tyrannical evil and irrational 'other of the ever-nebulous if not exotic 'Persia. He highlighted three points regarding the contribution of the Achaemenid Empire to the creation of democracy and human rights The founder of the Achaemenid Empire Cyrus the Great was the world 's first emperor to openly declare and guarantee the sanctity of human rights and individual freedom .... Cyrus was follower of the teachings of Zoroaster the founder of one of the world 's oldest monotheistic religions ..... When Cyrus defeated King Nabonidus of Babylon he officially declared the freedom of the Jews from their Babylonian captivity. This was the first time in history that world power had guaranteed the survival of the Jewish people religion customs and culture. He abolished slavery. General criticism Before the release of 300 Warner Bros. expressed concerns about the political aspects of the film 's theme. Snyder relates that there was huge sensitivity about East versus West with the studio. Media speculation about possible parallel between the Greco-Persian conflict and current events began in an interview with Snyder that was conducted before the Berlin Film Festival. The interviewer remarked that everyone is sure to be translating this film into contemporary politics. Snyder replied that he was aware that people would read the film through the lens of current events but no parallels between the film and the modern world were intended.Persian King Xerxes has been criticized for being portrayed as of African descent.Outside current political parallels some critics have raised more general questions about the film 's ideological orientation. The New York Post 's Kyle Smith wrote that the film would have pleased Adolf 's boys and Slate 's Dana Stevens compared the film to The Eternal Jew as textbook example of how race-baiting fantasy and nationalist myth can serve as an incitement to total war. Since it 's product of the post-ideological post-Xbox 21st century 300 will instead be talked about as technical achievement the next blip on the increasingly blurry line between movies and video games. Roger Moore critic for the Orlando Sentinel relates 300 to Susan Sontag 's definition of fascist art. Indeed the Lambda sign on the Spartans shields in 300 formed the inspiration for the official symbol of the far-right Identitarian movement.Newsday critic Gene Seymour on the other hand stated that such reactions are misguided writing that the movie 's just too darned silly to withstand any ideological theorizing. Snyder himself dismissed ideological readings suggesting that reviewers who critique graphic novel movie about bunch of guys ... stomping the snot out of each other using words like 'neocon 'homophobic 'homoerotic or 'racist are missing the point. Snyder however also admitted to fashioning an effeminate villain specifically to make young straight males in the audience uncomfortable What 's more scary to 20-year-old boy than giant god-king who wants to have his way with you. The Slovenian critic Slavoj Žižek pointed out that the story represents poor small country Greece invaded by the army of much large state Persia and suggested the identification of the Spartans with modern superpower to be flawed.The writer Frank Miller said The Spartans were paradoxical people. They were the biggest slave owners in Greece. But at the same time Spartan women had an unusual level of rights. It 's paradox that they were bunch of people who in many ways were fascist but they were the bulwark against the fall of democracy. The closest comparison you can draw in terms of our own military today is to think of the red-caped Spartans as being like our special-ops forces. They 're these almost superhuman characters with tremendous warrior ethic who were unquestionably the best fighters in Greece. did n't want to render Sparta in overly accurate terms because ultimately do want you to root for the Spartans. could n't show them being quite as cruel as they were. made them as cruel as thought modern audience could stand. Michael M. Chemers author of 'With Your Shield or on It Disability Representation in 300 in the Disability Studies Quarterly said that the film 's portrayal of the hunchback and his story is not mere ableism this is anti-disability. Frank Miller commenting on areas in which he lessened the Spartan cruelty for narrative purposes said have King Leonidas very gently tell Ephialtes the hunchback that they ca n't use him as soldier because of his deformity. It would be much more classically Spartan if Leonidas laughed and kicked him off the cliff. Iranian criticism From its opening 300 also attracted controversy over its portrayal of Persians. Officials of the Iranian government denounced the film. Some scenes in the film portray demon-like and other fictional creatures as part of the Persian army and the fictionalized portrayal of Persian King Xerxes has been criticized as effeminate. Critics suggested that it was meant to stand in stark contrast to the portrayed masculinity of the Spartan army. Steven Rea argued that the film 's Persians were vehicle for an anachronistic cross-section of Western aspirational stereotypes of Asian and African cultures.The film 's portrayal of ancient Persians caused particularly strong reaction in Iran. Various Iranian officials condemned the film. The Iranian Academy of the Arts submitted formal complaint against the film to UNESCO that called it an attack on the historical identity of Iran. The Iranian mission to the UN protested the film in press release and Iranian embassies protested its screening in France Thailand Turkey and Uzbekistan. The film was banned within Iran as hurtful American propaganda. Reviewers in the United States and elsewhere noted the political overtones of the West-against-Iran story line and the way Persians are depicted as decadent sexually flamboyant and evil in contrast to the noble Greeks. With illegal versions of the film already available in Tehran with the film 's international release and news of the film 's surprising success at the US box office the film prompted widespread anger in Iran. Azadeh Moaveni of Time reported All of Tehran was outraged. Everywhere went yesterday the talk vibrated with indignation over the film. Newspapers in Iran featured headlines such as Hollywood declares war on Iranians and 300 Against 70 Million the latter being the size of Iran 's population. Ayende-No an independent Iranian newspaper said The film depicts Iranians as demons without culture feeling or humanity who think of nothing except attacking other nations and killing people. Four Iranian Members of Parliament have called on Muslim countries to ban the film and group of Iranian film makers submitted letter of protest to UNESCO regarding the film 's misrepresentation of Iranian history and culture. The cultural advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad called the film an American attempt for psychological warfare against Iran. Moaveni identified two factors that may have contributed to the intensity of Iranian indignation over the film. Firstly she described the timing of the film 's release on the eve of Nowruz the Persian New Year as inauspicious. Secondly Iranians tend to view the era depicted in the film as particularly noble page in their history. Moaveni also suggested that the box office success of 300 compared with the relative flop of Alexander another spurious period epic dealing with Persians is cause for considerable alarm signaling ominous U.S. intentions. According to The Guardian Iranian critics of 300 ranging from bloggers to government officials described the movie as calculated attempt to demonise Iran at time of intensifying U.S. pressure over the country 's nuclear programme. An Iranian government spokesman described the film as hostile behavior which is the result of cultural and psychological warfare. Moaveni reported that the Iranians with whom she interacted were adamant that the movie was secretly funded by the U.S. government to prepare Americans for going to war against Iran. In popular culture 300 has been spoofed in film television and other media and spawned the This is Sparta. internet meme. Skits based upon the film have appeared on Saturday Night Live and Robot Chicken the latter of which mimicked the visual style of 300 in parody set during the American Revolutionary War titled 1776. Other parodies include an episode of South Park named D-Yikes. the short film United 300 which won the 2007 MTV Movie Spoof Award and BOO. by Mad magazine in its September 2007 issue 481 written by Desmond Devlin and illustrated by Mort Drucker. 20th Century Fox released Meet the Spartans spoof directed by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. Universal Pictures once planned similar parody titled National Lampoon 's 301 The Legend of Awesomest Maximus Wallace Leonidas. Samurai Jack an American animated series by Genndy Tartakovsky also paid homage to the Battle of Thermopylae in the 12th episode of its second season but instead used minotaur robots as the antagonists.300 particularly its pithy quotations has been adopted by the student body of Michigan State University whose nickname is the Spartans with chants of Spartans what is your profession. becoming common at sporting events starting after the film 's release and Michigan State basketball head coach Tom Izzo dressed as Leonidas at one student event. Nate Ebner football player with the New England Patriots in the National Football League and formerly with the Ohio State Buckeyes was nicknamed Leonidas after the Greek warrior-king hero of Sparta acted by Gerard Butler in the movie 300 because of his intense workout regimen and his beard. Sequel In June 2008 producers Mark Canton Gianni Nunnari and Bernie Goldmann revealed that work had begun on sequel to 300 300 Rise of an Empire. Legendary Pictures had announced that Frank Miller started writing the follow-up graphic novel and Zack Snyder was interested in directing the adaptation but moved on to develop and direct the Superman reboot Man of Steel. Noam Murro directed instead while Zack Snyder produced. The film focused on the Athenian admiral Themistocles as portrayed by Australian actor Sullivan Stapleton. The sequel 300 Rise of an Empire was released on March 2014 and grossed 337 million worldwide.

In some Christian denominations Maundy Thursday Good Friday and Holy Saturday form the Easter Triduum. Etymology The English word Lent is shortened form of the Old English word lencten meaning spring season as its Dutch language cognate lente Old Dutch lentin still does today. dated term in German Lenz Old High German lenzo is also related. According to the Oxford English Dictionary 'the shorter form. Old Germanic type laŋgito- laŋgiton- seems to be derivative of laŋgo- long and may possibly have reference to the lengthening of the days as characterizing the season of spring. The origin of the -en element is less clear it may simply be suffix or lencten may originally have been compound of laŋgo- 'long and an otherwise little-attested word -tino meaning day .In languages spoken where Christianity was earlier established such as Greek and Latin the term signifies the period dating from the 40th weekday before Easter. In modern Greek the term is Σαρακοστή Sarakostí derived from the earlier Τεσσαρακοστή Tessarakostí meaning fortieth. The corresponding word in Latin quadragesima fortieth is the origin of the terms used in Latin-derived languages and in some others. Examples in the Romance language group are Catalan quaresma French carême Galician coresma Italian quaresima Occitan quaresma Portuguese quaresma Romanian păresimi Sardinian caresima Spanish cuaresma and Walloon cwareme. Examples in non-Latin-based languages are Albanian kreshma Basque garizuma Croatian korizma Irish and Scottish Gaelic carghas Swahili kwaresima Filipino kuwaresma and Welsh rawys.In other languages the name used refers to the activity associated with the season. Thus it is called fasting period in Czech postní doba German Fastenzeit and Norwegian fasten/fastetid and it is called The Great Fast in Arabic الصوم الكبير al-ṣawm al-kabīr Syriac ܨܘܡܐ ܪܒܐ ṣawmā rabbā Polish wielki post Russian великий пост vieliki post and Ukrainian великий піст velyky pist. Romanian apart from version based on the Latin term referring to the 40 days see above also has great fast version postul mare. Dutch has three options one of which means fasting period and the other two referring to the 40-day period indicated in the Latin term vastentijd veertigdagentijd and quadragesima respectively. Origin The pattern of fasting and praying for forty days is seen in the Christian Bible on which basis the liturgical season of Lent was established. In the Old Testament the prophet Moses went into the mountains for forty days and forty nights to pray and fast without eating bread or drinking water before receiving the Ten Commandments cf. Exodus 34:28. Likewise the prophet Elijah went into the mountains for forty days and nights to fast and pray until he reached Horeb the mountain of God when the word of the Lord came to him cf. Kings 19:8–9. The early Christian bishop Maximus of Turin wrote that as Elijah by fasting continiously for period of forty days and forty nights ... merited to extinguish the prolonged and severe dryness of the whole world doing so with stream of rain and steeping the earth 's dryness with the bounty of water from heaven in the Christian tradition this is interpreted as being figure of ourselves so that we also fasting total of forty days might merit the spiritual rain of baptism ... and shower from heaven might pour down upon the dry earth of the whole world and the abundant waters of the saving bath might saturate the lengthy drought of the Gentiles. In the New Testament Jesus went into the desert to fast and pray for forty days and forty nights it was during this time that Satan tried to tempt him cf. Matthew 4:1–3. The forty day and night fasts of Moses Elijah and Jesus prepared them for their work.Early Christianity records the tradition of fasting before Easter. The Apostolic Constitutions permit the consumption of bread vegetables salt and water in Lent with flesh and wine being forbidden. The Canons of Hippolytus authorize only bread and salt to be consumed during Holy Week. The practice of fasting and abstaining from alcohol meat and lacticinia during Lent thus became established in the Church.In AD 339 Athanasius of Alexandria wrote that the Lenten fast was forty-day fast that the entire world observed. Saint Augustine of Hippo AD 354–AD 430 wrote that Our fast at any other time is voluntary but during Lent we sin if we do not fast. Three main prevailing theories exist on the finalization of Lent as forty-day fast prior to the arrival of Easter Sunday First that it was created at the Council of Nicea in 325 and there is no earlier incarnation. Second that it is based on an Egyptian Christian post-theophany fast. Third combination of origins syncretized around the Council of Nicea. There are early references to periods of fasting prior to baptism. For instance the Didache 1st or 2nd-century Christian text commends the baptizer the one to be baptized and any others that are able to fast to prepare for the sacrament.For centuries it has been common practice for baptisms to take place on Easter and so such references were formerly taken to be references to pre-Easter fast. Tertullian in his 3rd-century work On Baptism indicates that Easter was most solemn day for baptism. However he is one of only handful of writers in the ante-Nicene period who indicates this preference and even he says that Easter was by no means the only favored day for baptisms in his locale.Since the 20th century scholars have acknowledged that Easter was not the standard day for baptisms in the early church and references to pre-baptismal periods of fasting were not necessarily connected with Easter. There were shorter periods of fasting observed in the pre-Nicene church Athanasius noted that the 4th-century Alexandrian church observed period of fasting before Pascha Easter. However it is known that the 40-day period of fasting the season later named Lent before Eastertide was clarified at the Nicene Council. In 363-64 AD the Council of Laodicea prescribed the Lenten fast as as of strict necessity. Date and duration The 40 days of Lent are calculated differently among the various Christian denominations that observe it depending on how the date of Easter is calculated but also on which days Lent is understood to begin and end and on whether all the days of Lent are counted consecutively. Additionally the date of Lent may depend on the calendar used by the particular church such as the revised Julian or Gregorian calendars typically used by Protestant Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches or the Ethiopian and Coptic calendars traditionally used by some Oriental Orthodox churches. Roman Catholicism Since 1970 in the Roman Rite Lent starts on Ash Wednesday and ends on the evening of Maundy Thursday with the Mass of the Lord 's Supper. This comprises period of 44 days. The Lenten fast excludes Sundays and continues through Good Friday and Holy Saturday totaling 40 days though the Eucharistic Fast still applies. Although Lent may formally end on Maundy Thursday Lenten fasting practices continue until the Easter Vigil and additionally the celebration of Easter is preceded by the Paschal fast.In the Ambrosian Rite Lent begins on the Sunday that follows what is celebrated as Ash Wednesday in the rest of the Latin Catholic Church and ends as in the Roman Rite thus being of 40 days counting the Sundays but not Maundy Thursday. The day for beginning the Lenten fast in the Ambrosian Rite is the Monday after Ash Wednesday. The special Ash Wednesday fast is transferred to the first Friday of the Ambrosian Lent. Until this rite was revised by Saint Charles Borromeo the liturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive celebrated in white vestments with chanting of the Gloria in Excelsis and Alleluia in line with the recommendation in Matthew 6:16 When you fast do not look gloomy. During Lent the Church discourages marriages but couples may marry if they forgo the special blessings of the Nuptial Mass and limit social celebrations.The period of Lent observed in the Eastern Catholic Churches corresponds to that in other churches of Eastern Christianity that have similar traditions. Protestantism and Western Orthodoxy In Protestant and Western Orthodox Churches that celebrate it the season of Lent lasts from Ash Wednesday to the evening of Holy Saturday. This calculation makes Lent last 46 days if the Sundays are included but only 40 days if they are excluded. This definition is still that of the Moravian Church Lutheran Church Anglican Church Methodist Church Western Rite Orthodox Church United Protestant Churches and those of the Reformed Churches i.e. Continental Reformed Presbyterian and Congregationalist that observe Lent. Eastern Orthodoxy and Byzantine Rite In the Byzantine Rite i.e. the Eastern Orthodox Great Lent Greek Μεγάλη Τεσσαρακοστή or Μεγάλη Νηστεία meaning Great 40 Days and Great Fast respectively is the most important fasting season in the church year.The 40 days of Great Lent include Sundays and begin on Clean Monday. The 40 days are immediately followed by what are considered distinct periods of fasting Lazarus Saturday and Palm Sunday which in turn are followed straightway by Holy Week. Great Lent is broken only after the Paschal Easter Divine Liturgy. The Eastern Orthodox Church maintains the traditional Church 's teaching on fasting. The rules for lenten fasting are the monastic rules. Fasting in the Orthodox Church is more than simply abstaining from certain foods. During the Great Lent Orthodox Faithful intensify their prayers and spiritual exercises go to church services more often study the Scriptures and the works of the Church Fathers in depth limit their entertainment and spendings and focus on charity and good works. Oriental Orthodoxy Among the Oriental Orthodox there are various local traditions regarding Lent. Those using the Alexandrian Rite i.e. the Coptic Orthodox Coptic Catholic Ethiopian Orthodox Ethiopian Catholic Eritrean Orthodox and Eritrean Catholic Churches observe eight continuous weeks of fasting constituting three distinct consecutive fasting periods Pre-Lenten fast in preparation for Great Lent Great Lent itself the Paschal fast during Holy Week which immediately follows LentAs in the Eastern Orthodox Churches the date of Easter is typically reckoned according to the Julian Calendar and usually occurs later than Easter according to Gregorian Calendar used by Catholic and Protestant Churches. ==== Ethiopian Orthodoxy ==== In Ethiopian Orthodoxy fasting tsome lasts for 55 continuous days before Easter Fasika although the fast is divided into three separate periods Tsome Hirkal the eight-day Fast of Heraclius commemorating the fast requested by the Byzantine Emperor Heraclius before he reputedly set out to fight the Sassanian Empire and recover the True Cross which had been seized and taken from Jerusalem Tsome Arba 40 days of Lent and Tsome Himamat seven days commemorating Holy Week. Fasting involves abstention from animal products meat dairy and eggs and refraining from eating or drinking before 3:00 pm. Ethiopian devotees may also abstain from sexual activity and the consumption of alcohol. Quartodecimanism Quartodeciman Christians end the fast of Lent on the Paschal full moon of the Hebrew calendar in order to celebrate the Feast of Unleavened Bread beginning on the 14th of Nisan whence the name derives. For this practice they were excommunicated in the Easter controversy of the 2nd century A.D. Associated customs Three traditional practices to be taken up with renewed vigour during Lent these are known as the three pillars of Lent prayer justice toward God fasting justice toward self almsgiving justice toward neighbours Self-reflection simplicity and sincerity honesty are emphasised during the Lenten season. Pre-Lenten observances ==== Shrovetide ==== During the season of Shrovetide it is customary for Christians to ponder what Lenten sacrifices they will make for Lent. Another hallmark of Shrovetide is the opportunity for last round of merrymaking associated with Carnival and Fastelavn before the start of the somber Lenten season. The traditions of carrying Shrovetide rods and consuming Shrovetide buns after attending church is celebrated.On the final day of the season Shrove Tuesday many traditional Christians such as Lutherans Anglicans Methodists and Roman Catholics make special point of self-examination of considering what wrongs they need to repent and what amendments of life or areas of spiritual growth they especially need to ask God 's help in dealing with. During Shrovetide many churches place basket in the narthex to collect the previous year 's Holy Week palm branches that were blessed and distributed during the Palm Sunday liturgies on Shrove Tuesday churches burn these palms to make the ashes used during the services held on the very next day Ash Wednesday.In historically Lutheran nations Shrovetide is known as Fastelavn. After attending the Mass on Shrove Sunday congregants enjoy Shrovetide buns fastelavnsboller round sweet buns that are covered with icing and filled with cream and/or jam. Children often dress up and collect money from people while singing. They also practice the tradition of hitting barrel which represents fighting Satan after doing this children enjoy the sweets inside the barrel. Lutheran Christians in these nations carry Shrovetide rods fastelavnsris which branches decorated with sweets little presents etc. that are used to decorate the home or give to children. In English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom and Canada the day before Lent is known as Shrove Tuesday which is derived from the word shrive meaning to administer the sacrament of confession to to absolve. In these countries pancakes are associated with Shrove Tuesday because they are way to use up rich foods such as eggs milk and sugar rich foods which are not eaten during the season. ==== Mardi Gras and carnival celebrations ==== Mardi Gras Fat Tuesday refers to events of the Carnival celebration beginning on or after the feast of Epiphany and culminating on the day before Lent. The carnival celebrations which in many cultures traditionally precede Lent are seen as last opportunity for excess before Lent begins. Some of the most famous are the Carnival of Barranquilla the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife the Carnival of Venice Cologne Carnival the New Orleans Mardi Gras the Rio de Janeiro carnival and the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival. ==== Pre-Lenten fasting ==== In stark contrast to traditions of merrymaking and feasting Oriental Orthodox Churches practice Pre-Lenten fast in preparation for Lent which is immediately followed by the fast of Great Lent without interruption. Fasting and Lenten sacrifice There are traditionally 40 days in Lent these are marked by fasting both from foods and festivities and by other acts of penance. Fasting is maintained for all forty days of Lent regardless of how they are enumerated see above. Historically fasting has been maintained continuously for the whole Lenten season including Sundays. The making of Lenten sacrifice in which Christians give up personal pleasure for the duration of 40 days is traditional practice during Lent.During Shrovetide and especially on Shrove Tuesday the day before the start of the Lenten season many Christians finalize their decision with respect to what Lenten sacrifices they will make for Lent. Examples include practicing vegetarianism and teetotalism during Lent as Lenten sacrifice. While making Lenten sacrifice it is customary to pray for strength to keep it many often wish others for doing so as well e.g. May God bless your Lenten sacrifice. In addition some believers add regular spiritual discipline to bring them closer to God such as reading Lenten daily devotional.For Lutherans Moravians Anglicans Methodists Roman Catholics United Protestants and Lent-observing Reformed Christians the Lenten penitential season ends after the Easter Vigil Mass or Sunrise service. Orthodox Christians also break their fast after the Paschal Vigil service which starts around 11:00 pm on Holy Saturday and which includes the Paschal celebration of the Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom. At the end of the service the priest blesses cheese eggs flesh meats and other items that the faithful have been abstaining from for the duration of Great Lent. Lenten traditions and liturgical practices are less common less binding and sometimes non-existent among some liberal and progressive Christians. greater emphasis on anticipation of Easter Sunday is often encouraged more than the penitence of Lent or Holy Week.Some Christians as well as secular groups also interpret the Lenten fast in positive tone not as renunciation but as contributing to causes such as environmental stewardship and improvement of health. Even some atheists find value in the Christian tradition and observe Lent.In cultivation of vegetables in temperate oceanic climate in the northern hemisphere Lent corresponds partly with the hungry gap. ==== Lenten Black Fast ==== Historically using the early Christian form known as the Black Fast the observant does not consume food for whole day until the evening and at sunset Christians traditionally break the Lenten fast of that day with supper no food is consumed in day apart from the Lenten supper. In India and Pakistan many Christians continue this practice of fasting until sunset on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with many fasting in this manner throughout the whole season of Lent. ==== Daniel Fast ==== Christians of various traditions including Catholics and Methodists have voluntarily undertaken the Daniel Fast during the season of Lent in which one abstains from meat fish egg dairy products chocolates ice creams sugar sweets wine or any alcoholic beverages cf. Daniel 10:3. ==== Lenten supper ==== After attending worship service often on Wednesday and Friday evenings it is common for Christians of various denominations to conclude that day 's Lenten fast together through communal Lenten supper which may be held in the church 's parish hall. Lenten suppers ordinarily take place in the home setting during the forty days of Lent during which family or individual concludes that day 's fast after mealtime prayer. ==== Abstinence from meat and animal produce ==== Fasting has historically included abstinence from wine meat and lacticinia edible produce derived from animals including dairy products and eggs which has been enjoined continuously for the whole duration of the season including Sundays. Throughout Christendom some adherents continue to mark the season with traditional abstention from the consumption of meat most notably among Lutherans Roman Catholics and Anglicans. The form of abstention may vary depending on what is customary some abstain from meat for 40 days some do so only on Fridays or some only on Good Friday itself. In Roman Catholicism lacticinia may be consumed by penitents in Spain and its colonised territories per pontifical decree of Pope Alexander VI. Until 1741 meat and lacticinia were otherwise forbidden for the whole season of Lent including Sundays. In that year Pope Benedict XIV allowed for the consumption of meat and lacticinia during certain fasting days of Lent.Dispensations for the allowance of certain foods have been given throughout history depending on the climate in that part of the world. For example Giraldus Cambrensis in his Itinerary of Archbishop Baldwin through Wales reports that in Germany and the arctic regions great and religious persons eat the tail of beavers as fish because of its superficial resemblance to both the taste and colour of fish. The animal was very abundant in Wales at the time. Saint Thomas Aquinas allowed for the consumption of candy during Lent because sugared spices such as comfits were in his opinion digestive aids on par with medicine rather than food.Fasting practices are considerably relaxed in Western societies today though in the Eastern Orthodox Oriental Orthodox Eastern Catholic and Eastern Lutheran Churches abstinence from all animal products including eggs fish fowl and milk is still commonly practiced so that where this is observed only vegetarian or vegan meals are consumed for the whole of Lent 48 days in the Byzantine Rite. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church practices require fasting period that is great deal longer and there is some dispute over whether fish consumption is permissible. In the traditions of Lent-observing Western Christian churches abstinence from eating some form of food generally meat but not dairy or fish products is distinguished from fasting. In principle abstinence is to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on every Friday of the year that is not solemnity liturgical feast day of the highest rank but in each country the episcopal conference can determine the form it is to take perhaps replacing abstinence with other forms of penance. ==== Sexual abstinence ==== Through the Middle Ages Christians abstained from sexual relations during the whole of Lent. In view of this nine months after Lent birth records were drastically low due to believers abstaining from intimate relations during Lent. In Spain according to researchers from the University of Valencia and the University of Alcalà the custom of abstaining from sexual relations was widely practiced until the end of the Franco régime though some Christians voluntarily continue this practice today and denominations such as the Greek Orthodox Church continue to require abstinence from sexual relations during Lent. ==== Specific fasting traditions by Christian denomination ==== ===== Roman Catholicism ===== Prior to 1966 the Roman Catholic Church allowed Catholics of fasting age to eat only one full meal day throughout all forty days of Lent except on the Lord 's Day. Catholics were allowed to take smaller meal called collation which was introduced after the 14th century A.D. and cup of some beverage accompanied by little bread in the morning. The 1917 Code of Canon Law allowed the full meal on fasting day to be taken at any hour and to be supplemented by two collations with the quantity and the quality of the food to be determined by local custom. Abstinence from meat was to be observed on Ash Wednesday and on Fridays and Saturdays in Lent.The Lenten fast ended on Holy Saturday at noon. Only those aged 21 to 59 were obliged to fast. As with all ecclesiastical laws particular difficulties such as strenuous work or illness excused one from observance and dispensation from the law could be granted by bishop or parish priest. rule of thumb is that the two collations should not add up to the equivalent of another full meal. Rather portions were to be sufficient to sustain strength but not sufficient to satisfy hunger. In 1966 Pope Paul VI reduced the obligatory fasting days from all forty days of Lent to Ash Wednesday and Good Friday abstinence days to Fridays and Ash Wednesday and allowed episcopal conferences to replace abstinence and fasting with other forms of penitence such as charity and piety as declared and established in his apostolic constitution Paenitemini fasting on all forty days of Lent is still strongly recommended though not under pain of mortal sin. This was done so that those in countries where the standard of living is lower can replace fasting with prayer but …where economic well-being is greater so much more will the witness of asceticism have to be given… This was made part of the 1983 Code of Canon Law which made obligatory fasting for those aged between 18 and 59 and abstinence for those aged 14 and upward. The Irish Catholic Bishops Conference decided to allow other forms of Friday penance to replace that of abstinence from meat whether in Lent or outside Lent suggesting alternatives such as abstaining from some other food or from alcohol or smoking making special effort at participating in family prayer or in Mass making the Stations of the Cross or helping the poor sick old or lonely.The Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales made similar ruling in 1985 but decided in 2011 to restore the traditional year-round Friday abstinence from meat. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has maintained the rule of abstention from meat on Friday only during Lent and considers poultry to be type of meat but not fish or shellfish.The Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen CMRI Sedevacantist Roman Catholic congregation requires fasting for its members on all of the forty days of the Christian season of repentance Lent except on the Lord 's Day. The CMRI mandates under the pain of grave sin abstinence from meat on Ash Wednesday Good Friday Holy Saturday and all Fridays of the year in general.Even during Lent the rule about solemnities holds so that the obligation of Friday abstinence does not apply on 19 and 25 March when as usually happens the solemnities of Saint Joseph and the Annunciation are celebrated on those dates. The same applies to Saint Patrick 's Day which is solemnity in the whole of Ireland as well as in dioceses that have Saint Patrick as their principal patron saint. In some other places too where there are strong Irish traditions within the Catholic community dispensation is granted for that day. In Hong Kong where Ash Wednesday often coincides with Chinese New Year celebrations dispensation is then granted from the laws of fast and abstinence and the faithful are exhorted to use some other form of penance. ===== Lutheranism ===== Following the birth of Lutheranism in the Protestant Reformation Lutheran church orders in the 16th century retained the observation of the Lenten fast and Lutherans have observed this season with serene earnest attitude. Many Lutheran churches advocate fasting during Lent especially on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday. Handbook for the Discipline of Lent published by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America mainline Lutheran denomination offers number of guidelines for fasting abstinence and other forms of self-denial during Lent Fast on Ash Wednesday and Good Friday with only one simple meal during the day usually without meat. Refrain from eating meat bloody foods on all Fridays in Lent substituting fish for example. Eliminate food or food group for the entire season. Especially consider saving rich and fatty foods for Easter. Consider not eating before receiving Communion in Lent. Abstain from or limit favorite activity television movies etc. for the entire season and spend more time in prayer Bible study and reading devotional material. Do n't just give up something that you have to give up for your doctor or diet anyway. Make your fast voluntary self-denial i.e. discipline that you offer to God in prayer. The Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod confessional Lutheran denomination likewise permits but does not require members to give things up for Lent while emphasizing that the purpose of Lent is repentance from sin rather than minor acts of self-denial in themselves. ===== Moravian Church ===== Members of the Moravian Church voluntarily fast during the season of Lent along with making Lenten sacrifice for the season as form of penitence. ===== Reformed Churches ===== John Calvin the principal figure in the development of Reformed theology critiqued the practice of Lent in his Institutes of the Christian Religion as superstitious observance and observed that Christ did not fast repeatedly which he must have done had he meant to lay down law for an anniversary fast but once only when preparing for the promulgation of the gospel. Similarly leading Reformed divines such as Samuel Rutherford rejected the obligation of Lent.The Directory for Public Worship produced by the Westminster Assembly in 1644 and approved by the Scottish Parliament in 1645 takes the position that here is no day commanded in scripture to be kept holy under the gospel but the Lord day which is the Christian Sabbath and approves of fasting specifically upon special emergent occasions cf. days of humiliation and thanksgiving. Accordingly and in keeping with the Reformed regulative principle of worship the Reformed churches have historically not observed Lent.Some churches in the Reformed tradition observe Lent today. For example the Reformed Church in America Mainline Protestant denomination describes the first day of Lent Ash Wednesday as day focused on prayer fasting and repentance encouraging members to observe Holy Lent by self-examination and penitence by prayer and fasting by practicing works of love and by reading and reflecting on God 's Holy Word. Among Reformed Christians who do observe Lent Good Friday which is towards the end of the Lenten season is an important day of communal fasting as it is for many Episcopalians Lutherans and Methodists. ===== Anglican Churches ===== In the Anglo-Catholic wing of the Anglican Communion the Saint Augustine 's Prayer Book companion to the Book of Common Prayer states that fasting is usually meaning not more than light breakfast one full meal and one half meal on the forty days of Lent. It further states that the major Fast Days of Ash Wednesday and Good Friday as the American Prayer-Book indicates are stricter in obligation though not in observance than the other Fast Days and therefore should not be neglected except in cases of serious illness or other necessity of an absolute character. ===== Methodist Churches ===== The historic Methodist homilies regarding the Sermon on the Mount stress the importance of the Lenten fast which begins on Ash Wednesday. The United Methodist Church therefore states that There is strong biblical base for fasting particularly during the 40 days of Lent leading to the celebration of Easter. Jesus as part of his spiritual preparation went into the wilderness and fasted 40 days and 40 nights according to the Gospels. Good Friday which is towards the end of the Lenten season is traditionally an important day of communal fasting for Methodists. Rev. Jacqui King the minister of Nu Faith Community United Methodist Church in Houston explained the philosophy of fasting during Lent as 'm not skipping meal because in place of that meal 'm actually dining with God. The United Methodist Church teaches in reference to one 's Lenten sacrifice that On each Lord 's Day in Lent while Lenten fasts continue the reverent spirit of Lent is tempered with joyful anticipation of the Resurrection. ==== Other related fasting periods ==== The number 40 has many Biblical references Moses spent 40 days on Mount Sinai with God Elijah spent 40 days and nights walking to Mount Horeb God sent 40 days and nights of rain in the great flood of Noah The Hebrew people wandered 40 years in the desert while traveling to the Promised Land Jonah 's prophecy of judgment gave 40 days to the city of Nineveh in which to repent or be destroyed Jesus retreated into the wilderness where He fasted for 40 days and was tempted by the devil. He overcame all three of Satan 's temptations by citing scripture to the devil at which point the devil left him angels ministered to Jesus and He began His ministry. Jesus further said that His disciples should fast when the bridegroom shall be taken from them reference to his Passion. It is the traditional belief that Jesus lay for 40 hours in the tomb which led to the 40 hours of total fasting that preceded the Easter celebration in the early Church the biblical reference to 'three days in the tomb is understood by them as spanning three days from Friday afternoon to early Sunday morning rather than three 24-hour periods of time. Some Christian denominations such as The Way International and Logos Apostolic Church of God as well as Anglican scholar E. W. Bullinger in The Companion Bible believe Christ was in the grave for total of 72 hours reflecting the type of Jonah in the belly of the whale.One of the most important ceremonies at Easter is the baptism of the initiates on Easter Eve. The fast was initially undertaken by the catechumens to prepare them for the reception of this sacrament. Later the period of fasting from Good Friday until Easter Day was extended to six days to correspond with the six weeks of training necessary to give the final instruction to those converts who were to be baptized.Converts to Christianity followed strict catechumenate or period of instruction and discipline prior to receiving the sacrament of baptism sometimes lasting up to three years. In Jerusalem near the close of the fourth century classes were held throughout Lent for three hours each day. With the legalization of Christianity by the Edict of Milan and its later imposition as the state religion of the Roman Empire its character was endangered by the great influx of new members. In response the Lenten fast and practices of self-renunciation were required annually of all Christians both to show solidarity with the catechumens and for their own spiritual benefit. Almsgiving In addition to fasting and the Lenten sacrifice the period of Lent is traditionally time of almsgiving when Christians are encouraged to donate the value of what they forego during Lent. Prayer and devotion common practice is the singing of the Stabat Mater hymn in designated groups. Among Filipino Roman Catholics the recitation of the epic of Christ passion called Pasiong Mahal is also observed. In many Christian countries grand religious processions and cultural customs are observed such as the Stations of the Cross. custom of visiting seven churches during Holy Week to pray the Stations of the Cross and praying at each church exists and has been done in an ecumenical context involving Christians of the Catholic Methodist Episcopal and Salvationist traditions among others. ==== Omission of Gloria and Alleluia ==== The Gloria in excelsis Deo which is usually said or sung on Sundays at Mass or Communion of the Roman Lutheran and Anglican rites is omitted on the Sundays of Lent as well as Sundays of Advent but continues in use on solemnities and feasts and on special celebrations of more solemn kind. Some Mass compositions were written especially for Lent such as Michael Haydn 's Missa tempore Quadragesimae without Gloria in minor and for modest forces only choir and organ. The Gloria is used on Maundy Thursday to the accompaniment of bells which then fall silent until the Gloria in excelsis of the Easter Vigil.The Lutheran Divine Service the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church the Anglican Churches and the Presbyterian service of worship associate the Alleluia with joy and omit it entirely throughout Lent not only at Mass but also in the canonical hours and outside the liturgy. The word Alleluia at the beginning and end of the Acclamation Before the Gospel at Mass is replaced by another phrase. Before 1970 the omission began with Septuagesima and the whole Acclamation was omitted and was replaced by Tract and in the Liturgy of the Hours the word Alleluia normally added to the Gloria Patri at the beginning of each Hour now simply omitted during Lent was replaced by the phrase Laus tibi Domine rex aeternae gloriae Praise to you Lord king of eternal glory. Until the Ambrosian Rite was revised by Saint Charles Borromeo the liturgy of the First Sunday of Lent was festive celebrated with chanting of the Gloria and Alleluia in line with the recommendation in Matthew 6:16 When you fast do not look gloomy. In the Byzantine Rite the Gloria Great Doxology continues to be used in its normal place in the Matins service and the Alleluia appears all the more frequently replacing God is the Lord at Matins. ==== Veiling of religious images ==== In certain majority-Christian states in which liturgical forms of Christianity predominate religious objects were traditionally veiled for the entire 40 days of Lent. Though perhaps uncommon in the United States of America this practice is consistently observed in Goa Malta Peru the Philippines the latter only for the entire duration of Holy Week with the exception of processional images and in the Spanish cities Barcelona Málaga and Seville. In Ireland before Vatican II when impoverished rural Catholic convents and parishes could not afford purple fabrics they resorted to either removing the statues altogether or if too heavy or bothersome turned the statues to face the wall. As is popular custom the 14 Stations of the Cross plaques on the walls are not veiled. Crosses were often adorned with jewels and gemstones the form referred to as Crux Gemmata. To keep the faithful from adoring elaborately-ornamented crucifixes churches began veiling them in purple fabrics. The violet colour later came to symbolize penance and mourning. Further liturgical changes in modernity reduced such observances to the last week of Passiontide. In parishes that could afford only small quantities of violet fabrics only the heads of the statues were veiled. If no violet fabrics could be afforded at all then the religious statues and images were turned around facing the wall. Flowers were removed as sign of solemn mourning. In the pre-1992 Methodist liturgy and pre-1970 forms of the Roman Rite the last two weeks of Lent are known as Passiontide period beginning on the Fifth Sunday in Lent which in the 1962 edition of the Roman Missal is called the First Sunday in Passiontide and in earlier editions Passion Sunday. All statues and in England paintings as well in the church were traditionally veiled in violet. This was seen as in keeping with John 8:46–59 the Gospel of that Sunday in which Jesus hid himself from the people. Within many churches in the United States of America after the Second Vatican Council the need to veil statues or crosses became increasingly irrelevant and was deemed unnecessary by some diocesan bishops. As result the veils were removed at the singing of the Gloria in Excelsis Deo during the Easter Vigil. In 1970 the name Passiontide was dropped although the last two weeks are markedly different from the rest of the season and continuance of the tradition of veiling images is left to the discretion of country 's conference of bishops or even to individual parishes as pastors may wish. On Good Friday the Anglican Lutheran and Methodist churches traditionally veiled all pictures statutes and the cross are covered in mourning black while the chancel and altar coverings are replaced with black and altar candles are extinguished. The fabrics are then replaced with white on sunrise on Easter Sunday. Vestments In the Lutheran Methodist Roman Catholic and many Anglican churches pastors and priests wear violet vestments during the season of Lent. Roman Catholic priests wear white vestments on solemnity days for St. Joseph March 19 and the Annunciation March 25 although these solemnities are transferred to another date if they fall on Sunday during Lent or at any time during Holy Week. On the fourth Sunday of Lent rose-coloured pink vestments may be worn in lieu of violet. Historically black was also used Pope Innocent III declared black to be the proper color for Lent though Durandus of Saint-Pourçain asserted violet was preferable to black.In some Anglican churches type of unbleached linen or muslin known as Lenten array is worn during the first three weeks of Lent crimson is worn during Passiontide and on holy days the colour proper to the day is worn. In certain other Anglican churches as an alternative to violet for all of Lent except Holy Week and red beginning on Palm Sunday through Holy Saturday Lenten array typically made of sackcloth such as burlap and trimmed with crimson cloth often velvet is worn even during Holy Week—since the sackcloth represents penance and the crimson edges represent the Passion of Christ. Even the veils that cover the altar crosses or crucifixes and statuary if any are made of the same sackcloth with the crimson trim. Holy days within the season of Lent There are several holy days within the season of Lent Clean Monday is the first of Lent in Eastern Christianity. Ash Wednesday is the first day of Lent in Western Christianity such as the Roman Rite of the Roman Catholic Church the Lutheran Churches and Methodist Churches. However in the Ambrosian Rite and the Mozarabic Rite there is no Ash Wednesday Lent begins on the first Sunday and the fast begins on the first Monday. Lenten SundaysThe first Sunday in Lent marks one of the weeks during which Ember days are observed in Western Christian churches. The fourth Sunday in Lent which marks the halfway point between Ash Wednesday and Easter Sunday is referred to as Laetare Sunday by Anglicans Roman Catholics and many other Christians because of the traditional Entrance Antiphon of the Mass. Due to the more joyful character of the day since laetare in Latin means rejoice the priest deacon and subdeacon have the option of wearing vestments of rose colour pink instead of violet. Additionally the fourth Lenten Sunday Mothering Sunday which has become known as Mother 's Day in the United Kingdom and an occasion for honouring mothers of children has its origin in 16th-century celebration of the Mother Church. The fourth Sunday of Lent has also been called Rose Sunday on this day the Pope blesses the Golden Rose jewel in the shape of rose.The fifth Sunday in Lent also known in some denominations as Passion Sunday and in some denominations also applies to Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Passiontide. The sixth Sunday in Lent commonly called Palm Sunday marks the beginning of Holy Week the final week of Lent immediately preceding Easter. The Sundays in Lent carry Latin names in German Lutheranism derived from the beginning of the Sunday 's introit. The first is called Invocabit the second Reminiscere the third Oculi the fourth Laetare the fifth Judica the sixth Palm Sunday.Wednesday of Holy Week Holy Wednesday also sometimes known as Spy Wednesday commemorates Judas Iscariot 's bargain to betray Jesus. Thursday of Holy Week is known as Maundy Thursday or Holy Thursday and is day Christians commemorate the Last Supper shared by Christ with his disciples. The next day is Good Friday which begins the Easter Triduum on this day Christians remember Jesus crucifixion death and burial. Easter Triduum In the Anglican Lutheran Old Catholic Roman Catholic and many other traditions the Easter Triduum is three-day event that begins Maundy Thursday evening with the entrance hymn of the Mass of the Lord 's Supper. After this celebration the consecrated Hosts are taken solemnly from the altar to place of reposition where the faithful are invited to meditate in the presence of the consecrated Hosts.This is the Church 's response to Jesus question to the disciples sleeping in the Garden of Gethsemane Could you not watch with me one hour. On the next day the liturgical commemoration of the Passion of Jesus Christ is celebrated at pm unless later time is chosen due to work schedules. This service consists of readings from the Scriptures especially John the Evangelist 's account of the Passion of Jesus followed by prayers veneration of the cross of Jesus and communion service at which the hosts consecrated at the evening Mass of the day before are distributed. The Easter Vigil during the night between Holy Saturday afternoon and Easter Sunday morning starts with the blessing of fire and special candle and with readings from Scripture associated with baptism. Then the Gloria in Excelsis Deo is sung water is blessed baptism and confirmation of adults may take place the people are invited to renew the promises of their own baptism and finally Mass is celebrated in the usual way from the Preparation of the Gifts onwards. Holy Week and the season of Lent depending on denomination and local custom end with Easter Vigil at sundown on Holy Saturday or on the morning of Easter Sunday. It is custom for some churches to hold sunrise services which include open air celebrations in some places. Media coverage In the United Kingdom BBC 's Radio Four normally broadcasts during Lent series of programmes called the Lent Talks. These 15-minute programmes are normally broadcast on Wednesday and have featured various speakers such as Christian apologist John Lennox.

Democrats and Veterans,The Democrats and Veterans Direct Democracy Party DVDDP was political party in the United Kingdom. It became the Star Direct Democracy Party.The party was founded in 2018 by former UKIP member and Gulf War veteran Gavin Felton and other ex-servicemen of the British Armed Forces. John Rees-Evans previously UKIP leadership candidate was announced as the first party leader and Gavin Felton named as chairman.The party considers itself to be broadly libertarian in character. Its platform includes complete withdrawal from the European Union direct democracy and stronger support for veterans.,The Democrats and Veterans Direct Democracy Party DVDDP was political party in the United Kingdom.

Electoral history In January 2018 the party said it had 321 candidates ready to fight seats throughout the country. It stated that it would target voters in Essex. The party stood candidates in the May 2018 English local elections but did not win any seats.The party fielded Massimo DiMambro as candidate in the 2018 Lewisham East by-election who lost his deposit having received under of the vote.The party took second place in Barnsley local by-election in July 2018 took third in by-election for seat on Denbighshire Council in September 2018 They won their first two seats on Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council in May 2019. Cllr Victoria Felton received 1236 votes taking the Monk Bretton seat from Labour after 22 years. However as of October 2020 the council website shows that of the two elected Democrats and Veterans councillors one Trevor Smith has defected to the Labour Party whilst the other Victoria Felton is listed as Independent. In the 2019 general election Felton ran in Barnsley Central for the Brexit Party finishing second. In Northern Ireland the party stood two candidates in the 2019 local elections gaining 527 votes the highest amongst the three new parties in the election. The year before in October 2018 it ran in the Carrick Castle by-election and came fourth in what is the most prominent unionist consistency in NI. Summary References.

Group coded recording,In computer science group coded recording or group code recording GCR refers to several distinct but related encoding methods for representing data on magnetic media. The first used in 6250 bpi magnetic tape since 1973 is an error-correcting code combined with run length limited RLL encoding scheme belonging into the group of modulation codes. The others are different mainframe hard disk as well as floppy disk encoding methods used in some microcomputers until the late 1980s. GCR is modified form of NRZI code but necessarily with higher transition density.,In computer science group coded recording or group code recording GCR refers to several distinct but related encoding methods for representing data on magnetic media. The first used in 6250 bpi magnetic tape since 1973 is an error-correcting code combined with run length limited RLL encoding scheme belonging into the group of modulation codes. The others are different mainframe hard disk as well as floppy disk encoding methods used in some microcomputers until the late 1980s. GCR is modified form of NRZI code but necessarily with higher transition density. Magnetic tape Group coded recording was first used for magnetic tape data storage on 9-track reel-to-reel tape. The term was coined during the development of the IBM 3420 Model 4/6/8 Magnetic Tape Unit and the corresponding 3803 Model Tape Control Unit both introduced in 1973. IBM referred to the error correcting code itself as group coded recording. However GCR has come to refer to the recording format of 6250 bpi 250 bits/mm tape as whole and later to formats which use similar RLL codes without the error correction code. In order to reliably read and write to magnetic tape several constraints on the signal to be written must be followed. The first is that two adjacent flux reversals must be separated by certain distance on the media defined by the magnetic properties of the media itself. The second is that there must be reversal often enough to keep the reader 's clock in phase with the written signal that is the signal must be self-clocking and most importantly to keep the playback output high enough as this is proportional to the density of flux transitions. Prior to 6250 bpi tapes 1600 bpi tapes satisfied these constraints using technique called phase encoding PE which was only 50 efficient. For 6250 bpi GCR tapes RLL code is used or more specifically 4/5 block code sometimes also referred to as GCR 4B-5B encoding. This code requires five bits to be written for every four bits of data. The code is structured so that no more than two zero bits which are represented by lack of flux reversal can occur in row either within code or between codes no matter what the data was. This RLL code is applied independently to the data going to each of the nine tracks. Of the 32 five-bit patterns eight begin with two consecutive zero bits six others end with two consecutive zero bits and one more 10001 contains three consecutive zero bits. Removing the all-ones pattern 11111 from the remainder leaves 16 suitable code words. The 6250 bpi GCR RLL code 11 of the nibbles other than xx00 and 0001 have their code formed by prepending the complement of the most significant bit i.e. abcd is encoded as aabcd. The other five values are assigned codes beginning with 11. Nibbles of the form ab00 have codes 11baa i.e. the bit reverse of the code for ab11. The code 0001 is assigned the remaining value 11011. Because of the back then extremely high density of 6250 bpi tape the RLL code is not sufficient to ensure reliable data storage. On top of the RLL code an error-correcting code called the Optimal Rectangular Code ORC is applied. This code is combination of parity track and polynomial code similar to CRC but structured for error correction rather than error detection. For every seven bytes written to the tape before RLL encoding an eighth check byte is calculated and written to the tape. When reading the parity is calculated on each byte and exclusive-ORed with the contents of the parity track and the polynomial check code calculated and exclusive-ORed with the received check code resulting in two 8-bit syndrome words. If these are both zero the data is error free. Otherwise error-correction logic in the tape controller corrects the data before it is forwarded to the host. The error correcting code is able to correct any number of errors in any single track or in any two tracks if the erroneous tracks can be identified by other means. In newer IBM half-inch 18-track tape drives recording at 24000 bpi 4/5 GCR was replaced by more efficient 8/9 modulation code mapping eight bits to nine bits. Hard disks In the mid 1970s Sperry Univac ISS Division was working on large hard drives for the mainframe business using group coding. Floppy disks Like magnetic tape drives floppy disk drives have physical limits on the spacing of flux reversals also called transitions represented by one-bits. Micropolis Offering GCR-compatible diskette drives and floppy disk controllers like the 100163-51-8 and 100163-52-6 Micropolis endorsed data encoding with group coded recording on 5¼-inch 100 tpi 77-track diskette drives to store twelve 512-byte sectors per track since 1977 or 1978. Micro Peripherals Micro Peripherals Inc. MPI marketed double-density 5¼-inch disk drives like the single-sided B51 and double-sided B52 drives and controller solution implementing GCR since early 1978. Durango The Durango Systems F-85 introduced in September 1978 used single-sided 5¼-inch 100 tpi diskette drives providing 480 KB utilizing proprietary high-density 4/5 group coded encoding. The machine was using Western Digital FD1781 floppy disk controller designed by former Sperry ISS engineer with 77-track Micropolis drives. In later models such as the Durango 800 series this was expanded to double-sided option for 960 KB 946 KB formatted per diskette. Apple For the Apple II floppy drive Steve Wozniak invented floppy controller which along with the Disk II drive itself imposed two constraints Between any two one bits there may be maximum of one zero bit. Each 8-bit byte must start with one bit.The simplest scheme to ensure compliance with these limits is to record an extra clock transition before each data bit according to differential Manchester encoding or digital FM Frequency Modulation. Known as 4-and-4 encoding the resulting Apple implementation allowed only ten 256-byte sectors per track to be recorded on single-density 5¼-inch floppy. It uses two bytes for each byte. Close to month prior to the shipment of the disk drive in spring 1978 Wozniak realized that more complex encoding scheme would allow each eight-bit byte on disk to hold five bits of useful data rather than four bits. This is because there are 34 bytes which have the top bit set and no two zero bits in row. This encoding scheme became known as 5-and-3 encoding and allowed 13 sectors per track it was used for Apple DOS 3.1 3.2 and 3.2.1 as well as for the earliest version of Apple CP/M Reserved GCR-codes 0xAA and 0xD5.Wozniak called the system my most incredible experience at Apple and the finest job did .Later the design of the floppy drive controller was modified to allow byte on disk to contain up to one pair of zero bits in row. This allowed each eight-bit byte to hold six bits of useful data and allowed 16 sectors per track. This scheme is known as 6-and-2 encoding and was used on Apple Pascal Apple DOS 3.3 and ProDOS and later with Apple FileWare drives in the Apple Lisa and the 400K and 800K 3½-inch disks on the Macintosh and Apple II. Apple did not originally call this scheme GCR but the term was later applied to it to distinguish it from IBM PC floppies which used the MFM encoding scheme. Reserved GCR-codes 0xAA and 0xD5. Commodore Independently Commodore Business Machines CBM created group coded recording scheme for their Commodore 2040 floppy disk drive launched in the spring of 1979. The relevant constraints on the 2040 drive were that no more than two zero bits could occur in row the drive imposed no special constraint on the first bit in byte. This allowed the use of scheme similar to that used in 6250 bpi tape drives. Every four bits of data are translated into five bits on disk according to the following table Each code starts and ends with at most one zero bit ensuring that even when the codes are concatenated the encoded data will never contain more than two zero bits in row. With this encoding at most eight one bits in row are possible. Therefore Commodore used sequences of ten or more one bits in row as synchronization mark. This more efficient GCR scheme combined with an approach at constant bit-density recording by gradually increasing the clock rate zone constant angular velocity ZCAV and storing more physical sectors on the outer tracks than on the inner ones zone bit recording ZBR enabled Commodore to fit 170 kB on standard single-sided single-density 5.25-inch floppy where Apple fit 140 kB with 6-and-2 encoding or 114 kB with 5-and-3 encoding and an FM-encoded floppy held only 88 kB. Sirius/Victor Similar the 5.25-inch floppy drives of the Victor 9000 aka Sirius designed by Chuck Peddle in 1981/1982 used combination of ten-bit GCR and constant bit-density recording by gradually decreasing drive 's rotational speed for the outer tracks in nine zones form of zoned constant linear velocity ZCLV while increasing the number of sectors per track variant of zone bit recording ZBR to achieve formatted capacities of 606 kB single sided 1188 kB double-sided on 96 tpi media. Brother Starting around 1985 Brother introduced family of dedicated word processor typewriters with integrated 3.5-inch 38-track diskette drive. Early models of the WP and LW series used Brother-specific group-coded recording scheme with twelve 256-byte sectors to store up to 120 KB on single-sided and up to 240 KB on double-sided double-density DD diskettes. Reportedly prototypes were already shown at the Internationale Funkausstellung 1979 IFA in Berlin. Sharp In 1986 Sharp introduced turnable 2.5-inch pocket disk drive solution drives CE-1600F CE-140F internally based on the FDU-250 chassis media CE-1650F for their series of pocket computers with formatted capacity of 62464 bytes per side 2× 64 kB nominal 16 tracks sectors/track 512 bytes per sector 48 tpi 250 kbit/s 270 rpm with GCR 4/5 recording. Other uses GCR was also evaluated for possible use in bar code encoding schemes packing efficiency timing tolerances amount of storage bytes for timing information and DC output level.

He then earned master 's degree in computer science at Purdue University while also working full-time for the U.S. Department of the Navy. In 1977 he joined the Pillsbury Company where he later became vice president. During the 1980s Cain 's success as business executive at Burger King prompted Pillsbury to appoint him as chairman and CEO of Godfather 's Pizza in which capacity he served from 1986 to 1996. Cain was chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City Omaha Branch from 1989 to 1991. He was deputy chairman from 1992 to 1994 and then chairman until 1996 of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City. In 1995 he was appointed to the Kemp Commission and in 1996 he served as senior economic adviser to Bob Dole 's presidential campaign. From 1996 to 1999 Cain served as president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association. In May 2011 Cain announced his 2012 presidential candidacy. By the fall his proposed 9–9–9 tax plan and debating performances had made him serious contender for the Republican nomination. In November however Cain was accused of sexual harassment by multiple women. Cain denied the allegations but announced the suspension of his campaign on December.

He remained active in the Republican Party and was co-chairman of Black Voices for Trump in the 2020 election cycle. Cain died from COVID-19 on July 30 2020 at the age of 74. Early life Herman Cain was born on December 13 1945 in Memphis Tennessee to Lenora Davis Cain 1925–1982 cleaning woman and domestic worker and Luther Cain 1925–2005 who was raised on farm and worked as barber and janitor as well as chauffeur for Robert W. Woodruff the president of The Coca-Cola Company. Cain said that as he was growing up his family was poor but happy. Cain related that his mother taught him about her belief that success was not function of what you start out with materially but what you start out with spiritually. His father worked three jobs to own his own home—which he achieved during Cain 's childhood—and to allow his two sons to attend college.Cain grew up on the west side of Atlanta attending S. H. Archer High School and the Rev. Cameron M. Alexander 's Antioch Baptist Church North in the neighborhood now known as The Bluff. Eventually the family moved to modest brick home on Albert Street in the Collier Heights neighborhood. He graduated from high school in 1963. Education and career In 1967 Cain graduated from Morehouse College with Bachelor of Science in mathematics. In 1971 he received Master of Science in computer science from Purdue University while working full-time as ballistics analyst for the U.S. Department of the Navy as civilian.After completing his master 's degree at Purdue Cain left the Department of the Navy and began working for Coca-Cola in Atlanta as computer systems analyst. In 1977 he moved to Minneapolis to join Pillsbury becoming director of business analysis in its restaurant and foods group in 1978. Burger King and Godfather 's Pizza At age 36 Cain was assigned to analyze and manage 400 Burger King stores in the Philadelphia area. At the time Burger King was Pillsbury subsidiary. Under Cain his region posted strong improvement in three years. According to 1987 account in the Minneapolis Star Tribune Pillsbury 's then-president Win Wallin said He was an excellent bet. Herman always seemed to have his act together. At Burger King Cain established the BEAMER program which taught our employees mostly teenagers how to make our patrons smile by smiling themselves. It was success Within three months of the program 's initiation the sales trend was moving steadily higher. Cain 's success at Burger King prompted Pillsbury to appoint him president and CEO of another subsidiary Godfather 's Pizza. On his arrival on April 1986 Cain told employees 'm Herman Cain and this ai n't no April Fool 's joke. We are not dead. Our objective is to prove to Pillsbury and everyone else that we will survive. Godfather 's Pizza was performing poorly having slipped in ranks of pizza chains from third in 1985 to fifth in 1988. Under Cain 's leadership Godfather 's closed approximately 200 restaurants and eliminated several thousand jobs and by doing so returned to profitability. In leveraged buyout in 1988 Cain executive vice president and COO Ronald B. Gartlan and group of investors bought Godfather 's from Pillsbury. Federal Reserve Bank and National Restaurant Association Cain served as chairman of the board of the Omaha Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City from January 1989 to December 31 1991. He became member of the board of directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City in 1992. He served as deputy chairman from January 1992 to December 31 1994 and then as its chairman until August 19 1996 when he resigned to become active in national politics.Cain left Godfather 's Pizza in 1996 and moved to the District of Columbia From 1996 to 1999 he served as CEO of the National Restaurant Association trade group and lobbying organization for the restaurant industry on whose board of directors he had previously served. Cain 's lobbying work for the association led to number of connections to Republican lawmakers and politicians. Under Cain 's leadership the Association lobbied against increases to the minimum wage mandatory health care benefits regulations against smoking and lowering the blood alcohol limit that determines whether one is driving under the influence.Cain was on the board of directors of Aquila Inc. Nabisco Whirlpool Reader 's Digest and AGCO.After Cain 's term with the restaurant advocacy group ended in 1999 he returned to Omaha for about year then moved to his hometown of Atlanta in 2000. Media work Cain wrote syndicated op-ed column which was distributed by the North Star Writers Group.Cain appeared in the 2009 documentary An Inconvenient Tax. From 2008 to February 2011 Cain hosted The Herman Cain Show on Atlanta talk radio station WSB. On January 19 2012 Cain began working for WSB again by providing daily commentaries while occasionally filling in for Erick Erickson and Neal Boortz.Cain took over Boortz 's radio talk show on January 21 2013 upon Boortz 's retirement. The show was dropped from the Westwood One Radio Network in December 2016 in favor of The Chris Plante Show but continued to air in limited syndication through WSB 's owner Cox Radio.On February 15 2013 Fox News Channel announced Cain would join the network as contributor. In March 2019 Cain was panelist on Watter 's World episode. Recognition Cain received the 1996 Horatio Alger Award and was bestowed with honorary degrees from Creighton University Johnson Wales University Morehouse College the University of Nebraska–Lincoln the New York City College of Technology Purdue University Suffolk University and Tougaloo College.Then former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp referred to Cain as the Colin Powell of American capitalism. Kemp stated that Cain 's conquests wo n't be counted in terms of countries liberated or lives saved but in those things that make life worth living—expanding opportunity creating jobs and broadening horizons not just for those he knows but through his example for those he 'll never meet. Possible nomination to the Federal Reserve Board On April 2019 President Donald Trump said that he intended to nominate Cain to the second of the two vacant seats on the Federal Reserve Board. Assessing the possible nomination news publications reviewed Cain 's sexual misconduct allegations that preceded his withdrawal from the 2012 presidential election. Cain acknowledged that the nomination process would be more cumbersome for him due to his unusual career. He initially stated that he was not considering withdrawing his name from consideration for the seat. After it appeared likely that he would not receive enough votes to support his confirmation Cain withdrew on April 22 2019. Black Voices for Trump In the 2020 election cycle Cain was co-chairman of Black Voices for Trump. Political activities Role in the defeat of 1993 Clinton health care plan In 1994 as president-elect of the National Restaurant Association Cain challenged President Bill Clinton on the costs of the employer mandate contained within the Health Security Act and criticized the effect on small businesses. Bob Cohn of Newsweek described Cain as one of the primary opponents of the plan The Clintons would later blame Harry and Louise the fictional couple in the ads aired by the insurance industry for undermining health reform. But the real saboteurs are named Herman and John. Herman Cain is the president of Godfather 's Pizza and president-elect of the National Restaurant Association. An articulate entrepreneur Cain transformed the debate when he challenged Clinton at town meeting in Kansas City Missouri. Cain asked the president what he was supposed to say to the workers he would have to lay off because of the cost of the employer mandate. Clinton responded that there would be plenty of subsidies for small businessmen but Cain persisted. Quite honestly your calculation is inaccurate he told the president. In the competitive marketplace it simply does n't work that way. Because Kemp was impressed with Cain 's performance he chartered plane to Nebraska to meet Cain after the debate. As result Cain was appointed to the Kemp Commission in 1995.Joshua Green of The Atlantic called Cain 's exchange with President Clinton his auspicious debut on the national political stage. Senior adviser to 1996 Dole campaign Cain was senior economic adviser to the Bob Dole presidential campaign in 1996. 2000 presidential campaign Cain briefly ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He later said in looking back at the effort that it was more about making political statements than winning the nomination. George W. Bush was the chosen one he had the campaign DNA that followers look for. However Cain went on to state believe that had better message and believe that was the better messenger. After ending his own campaign however he endorsed Steve Forbes. 2004 U.S. Senate campaign In 2004 Cain ran for the U.S. Senate in Georgia and did not win in the primaries. He was pursuing the seat that came open with the retirement of Democrat Zell Miller. Cain sought the Republican nomination facing congressmen Johnny Isakson and Mac Collins in the primary. Collins tried to paint Cain as moderate citing Cain 's support for affirmative action programs while Cain argued that he was conservative noting that he opposed the legality of abortion except when the mother 's life is threatened. Cain finished second in the primary with 26.2 of the vote ahead of Collins who won 20.6 but because Isakson won 53.2 of the vote Isakson was able to avoid runoff. Americans for Prosperity and America 's PAC Starting in 2005 Cain worked for the political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity AFP alongside Mark Block. Block would later become campaign manager for Cain 's 2012 presidential run and would be joined in Cain 's campaign by several other AFP employees. Cain continued to receive honoraria for speaking at AFP events until he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination. Cain 's senior economic advisor during his 2012 presidential campaign Rich Lowrie who helped devise Cain 's 9–9–9 tax plan had served on the AFP board. In 2006 Cain voiced several radio ads encouraging people of color to vote Republican the ads were funded by group called America 's PAC and its founder J. Patrick Rooney. 2012 presidential campaign Tea Party activist Cain addressed numerous Tea Party rallies in 2010. Following the 2010 midterm elections Cain announced his intentions to run for president in December 2010 stating that there was 70 chance that he would attempt to seek the office. Later that month he was the surprise choice for 2012 GOP nominee in RedState reader poll. Cain announced the formation of an exploratory committee on January 12 2011 before formally announcing his candidacy on May 21 in Atlanta. ==== Straw poll victories ==== Cain 's addresses to conservative groups were well received and in late September and early October 2011 Cain won the straw polls of the Florida Republican Party TeaCon and the National Federation of Republican Women 's Convention. My focus groups have consistently picked Herman Cain as the most likeable candidate in the debates said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. Do n't underestimate the power of likability even in Republican primary. The more likeable the candidate the greater the electoral potential. ==== 9–9–9 Plan ==== In July 2011 an advisor suggested that his campaign 's tax policy plan be called the Optimal Tax but Cain rejected the name saying we 're just going to call it what it is 9–9–9 Plan. The plan would have replaced the then current tax code with 9-percent business transactions tax 9-percent personal income tax and 9-percent federal sales tax. During debate on October 12 Cain said his plan expands the base arguing that when you expand the base we can arrive at the lowest possible rate which is 9–9–9. An analysis released to Bloomberg News by the campaign claimed that the rate for each of the three taxes could in fact be as low as 7.3 but poverty grants —which Cain described as lower rate in targeted empowerment zones —necessitated national rate of nine percent. Paul Krugman criticized the plan saying it shifts much of the current tax burden from the rich to the poor. Arthur Laffer Lawrence Kudlow the Club for Growth and Congressman Paul Ryan spoke favorably of the plan. On October 21 Cain told crowd in Detroit that the plan would be 9–0–9 for the poor saying that if you are at or below the poverty level ... then you do n't pay that middle nine on your income. Cain 's 9–9–9 plan attracted skepticism from his fellow candidates at numerous Republican debates. ==== Sexual harassment allegations ==== In late October 2011 Politico reported that Cain had been accused by two women of sexual harassment and misconduct during his time as CEO of the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s. Two other women made additional harassment accusations later on. Cain acknowledged that the restaurant organization made financial settlements to the complainants. Two of the four women came forward publicly Sharon Bialek and Karen Kraushaar.On November 28 2011 Cain asserted that woman named Ginger White claimed to have had an affair with him and that the allegation was not true. In an interview with White which aired on the same day she stated that the affair lasted 13 years and ended right before Cain announced his presidential campaign. On November 30 2011 at an event in Dayton Ohio Cain denounced the allegations of sexual harassment and adultery. ==== End of 2012 campaign ==== On December 2011 Cain suspended his campaign. The sexual harassment claims were widely considered responsible for the sharp drop in his poll numbers.According to Pew Research Center report on December 21 2011 Cain was the most covered candidate among the Republicans during that year. Cain 's Solutions Revolution On January 2012 Cain announced the Cain 's Solutions Revolution. Cain 's stated goal was to get commitments from members of Congress to support the 9–9–9 Plan before the 2012 elections. Cain stated that he started new movement because the biggest comment got when ended my candidacy was to keep 9–9–9 alive. That 's what this is about and 'm going to keep it alive with what 'm calling Cain 's Solutions Revolution. In order to promote this movement Cain employed both bus tour and new website. New York magazine stated It 's Cain 's earnest effort to keep 9–9–9 alive and focus on solutions. On January 20 2012 Cain spoke at Stephen Colbert 's Rock Me Like Herman Cain South Cain-Olina Primary Rally. The Huffington Post reported the crowd size was between 3,000 and 5,000 people. It was described at the time as the largest campaign rally so far during this GOP presidential primary season. State of the Union response For President Barack Obama 's 2012 State of the Union address the Tea Party Express chose Cain to give its second annual response. After Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels gave the official GOP response Cain delivered his speech at the National Press Club. The speech was streamed live on the Tea Party Express website. Cain referred to Obama 's address as hodgepodge of liberal ideas adding that there were no big ideas that would impact job growth and no big ideas that would stimulate economic growth in this country. Call for third party Although Mitt Romney was endorsed by Cain on May 15 2012 he would eventually lose the general election to President Obama. Cain then told Bryan Fischer that the Republican Party no longer represented the interests of conservatives in the United States and that it did not have the ability to rebrand itself. He asserted that legitimate third party would be needed to replace it. Personal life Cain married Gloria Etchison of Atlanta soon after her graduation from Morris Brown College in 1968. The couple had two children Melanie and Vincent and four grandchildren.Cain served as an associate minister at the Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta which he joined at the age of 10. The church is part of the National Baptist Convention and is politically liberal and theologically conservative. The church 's senior pastor Rev. Cameron M. Alexander did not share Cain 's political philosophy.Disclosures filed during Cain 's 2011 campaign categorized his wealth at that time as being between 2.9 and 6.6 million with Cain 's combined income for both 2010 and 2011 being between 1.1 and 2.1 million. Health and death In 2006 Cain was diagnosed with Stage IV colon cancer and metastasis to his liver with 30 percent chance of survival. After he underwent surgery and chemotherapy the cancer was reported to be in remission.Cain opposed masking and social distancing mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. He attended the 2020 Trump Tulsa rally on June 20 and was photographed not wearing face mask in crowd who also were not wearing masks. On June 29 Cain tested positive for COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic in Georgia and was admitted to an Atlanta-area hospital two days later. On July Cain 's staff said there was no way of knowing for sure how or where he contracted the disease. Dan Calabrese the editor of Cain 's website said realize people will speculate about the Tulsa rally but Herman did lot of traveling that week including to Arizona where cases were spiking. Cain died of complications from COVID-19 on July 30 2020 at the age of 74.

Under Cain his region posted strong improvement in three years. According to 1987 account in the Minneapolis Star Tribune Pillsbury 's then-president Win Wallin said He was an excellent bet. Herman always seemed to have his act together. At Burger King Cain established the BEAMER program which taught our employees mostly teenagers how to make our patrons smile by smiling themselves. It was success Within three months of the program 's initiation the sales trend was moving steadily higher. Cain 's success at Burger King prompted Pillsbury to appoint him president and CEO of another subsidiary Godfather 's Pizza. On his arrival on April 1986 Cain told employees 'm Herman Cain and this ai n't no April Fool 's joke. We are not dead. Our objective is to prove to Pillsbury and everyone else that we will survive. Godfather 's Pizza was performing poorly having slipped in ranks of pizza chains from third in 1985 to fifth in 1988.

Possible nomination to the Federal Reserve Board On April 2019 President Donald Trump said that he intended to nominate Cain to the second of the two vacant seats on the Federal Reserve Board. Assessing the possible nomination news publications reviewed Cain 's sexual misconduct allegations that preceded his withdrawal from the 2012 presidential election. Cain acknowledged that the nomination process would be more cumbersome for him due to his unusual career.

Black Voices for Trump In the 2020 election cycle Cain was co-chairman of Black Voices for Trump. Political activities Role in the defeat of 1993 Clinton health care plan In 1994 as president-elect of the National Restaurant Association Cain challenged President Bill Clinton on the costs of the employer mandate contained within the Health Security Act and criticized the effect on small businesses. Bob Cohn of Newsweek described Cain as one of the primary opponents of the plan The Clintons would later blame Harry and Louise the fictional couple in the ads aired by the insurance industry for undermining health reform. But the real saboteurs are named Herman and John. Herman Cain is the president of Godfather 's Pizza and president-elect of the National Restaurant Association. An articulate entrepreneur Cain transformed the debate when he challenged Clinton at town meeting in Kansas City Missouri. Cain asked the president what he was supposed to say to the workers he would have to lay off because of the cost of the employer mandate. Clinton responded that there would be plenty of subsidies for small businessmen but Cain persisted. Quite honestly your calculation is inaccurate he told the president. In the competitive marketplace it simply does n't work that way. Because Kemp was impressed with Cain 's performance he chartered plane to Nebraska to meet Cain after the debate. As result Cain was appointed to the Kemp Commission in 1995.Joshua Green of The Atlantic called Cain 's exchange with President Clinton his auspicious debut on the national political stage. Senior adviser to 1996 Dole campaign Cain was senior economic adviser to the Bob Dole presidential campaign in 1996. 2000 presidential campaign Cain briefly ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 2000. He later said in looking back at the effort that it was more about making political statements than winning the nomination. George W. Bush was the chosen one he had the campaign DNA that followers look for. However Cain went on to state believe that had better message and believe that was the better messenger. After ending his own campaign however he endorsed Steve Forbes. 2004 U.S. Senate campaign In 2004 Cain ran for the U.S. Senate in Georgia and did not win in the primaries. He was pursuing the seat that came open with the retirement of Democrat Zell Miller. Cain sought the Republican nomination facing congressmen Johnny Isakson and Mac Collins in the primary. Collins tried to paint Cain as moderate citing Cain 's support for affirmative action programs while Cain argued that he was conservative noting that he opposed the legality of abortion except when the mother 's life is threatened. Cain finished second in the primary with 26.2 of the vote ahead of Collins who won 20.6 but because Isakson won 53.2 of the vote Isakson was able to avoid runoff. Americans for Prosperity and America 's PAC Starting in 2005 Cain worked for the political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity AFP alongside Mark Block. Block would later become campaign manager for Cain 's 2012 presidential run and would be joined in Cain 's campaign by several other AFP employees. Cain continued to receive honoraria for speaking at AFP events until he announced his campaign for the Republican nomination. Cain 's senior economic advisor during his 2012 presidential campaign Rich Lowrie who helped devise Cain 's 9–9–9 tax plan had served on the AFP board. In 2006 Cain voiced several radio ads encouraging people of color to vote Republican the ads were funded by group called America 's PAC and its founder J. Patrick Rooney. 2012 presidential campaign Tea Party activist Cain addressed numerous Tea Party rallies in 2010. Following the 2010 midterm elections Cain announced his intentions to run for president in December 2010 stating that there was 70 chance that he would attempt to seek the office. Later that month he was the surprise choice for 2012 GOP nominee in RedState reader poll. Cain announced the formation of an exploratory committee on January 12 2011 before formally announcing his candidacy on May 21 in Atlanta. ==== Straw poll victories ==== Cain 's addresses to conservative groups were well received and in late September and early October 2011 Cain won the straw polls of the Florida Republican Party TeaCon and the National Federation of Republican Women 's Convention. My focus groups have consistently picked Herman Cain as the most likeable candidate in the debates said GOP pollster Frank Luntz. Do n't underestimate the power of likability even in Republican primary. The more likeable the candidate the greater the electoral potential. ==== 9–9–9 Plan ==== In July 2011 an advisor suggested that his campaign 's tax policy plan be called the Optimal Tax but Cain rejected the name saying we 're just going to call it what it is 9–9–9 Plan. The plan would have replaced the then current tax code with 9-percent business transactions tax 9-percent personal income tax and 9-percent federal sales tax. During debate on October 12 Cain said his plan expands the base arguing that when you expand the base we can arrive at the lowest possible rate which is 9–9–9. An analysis released to Bloomberg News by the campaign claimed that the rate for each of the three taxes could in fact be as low as 7.3 but poverty grants —which Cain described as lower rate in targeted empowerment zones —necessitated national rate of nine percent. Paul Krugman criticized the plan saying it shifts much of the current tax burden from the rich to the poor. Arthur Laffer Lawrence Kudlow the Club for Growth and Congressman Paul Ryan spoke favorably of the plan. On October 21 Cain told crowd in Detroit that the plan would be 9–0–9 for the poor saying that if you are at or below the poverty level ... then you do n't pay that middle nine on your income. Cain 's 9–9–9 plan attracted skepticism from his fellow candidates at numerous Republican debates. ==== Sexual harassment allegations ==== In late October 2011 Politico reported that Cain had been accused by two women of sexual harassment and misconduct during his time as CEO of the National Restaurant Association in the late 1990s. Two other women made additional harassment accusations later on. Cain acknowledged that the restaurant organization made financial settlements to the complainants. Two of the four women came forward publicly Sharon Bialek and Karen Kraushaar.On November 28 2011 Cain asserted that woman named Ginger White claimed to have had an affair with him and that the allegation was not true. In an interview with White which aired on the same day she stated that the affair lasted 13 years and ended right before Cain announced his presidential campaign. On November 30 2011 at an event in Dayton Ohio Cain denounced the allegations of sexual harassment and adultery. ==== End of 2012 campaign ==== On December 2011 Cain suspended his campaign. The sexual harassment claims were widely considered responsible for the sharp drop in his poll numbers.According to Pew Research Center report on December 21 2011 Cain was the most covered candidate among the Republicans during that year. Cain 's Solutions Revolution On January 2012 Cain announced the Cain 's Solutions Revolution. Cain 's stated goal was to get commitments from members of Congress to support the 9–9–9 Plan before the 2012 elections. Cain stated that he started new movement because the biggest comment got when ended my candidacy was to keep 9–9–9 alive. That 's what this is about and 'm going to keep it alive with what 'm calling Cain 's Solutions Revolution. In order to promote this movement Cain employed both bus tour and new website. New York magazine stated It 's Cain 's earnest effort to keep 9–9–9 alive and focus on solutions. On January 20 2012 Cain spoke at Stephen Colbert 's Rock Me Like Herman Cain South Cain-Olina Primary Rally. The Huffington Post reported the crowd size was between 3,000 and 5,000 people. It was described at the time as the largest campaign rally so far during this GOP presidential primary season. State of the Union response For President Barack Obama 's 2012 State of the Union address the Tea Party Express chose Cain to give its second annual response. After Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels gave the official GOP response Cain delivered his speech at the National Press Club. The speech was streamed live on the Tea Party Express website. Cain referred to Obama 's address as hodgepodge of liberal ideas adding that there were no big ideas that would impact job growth and no big ideas that would stimulate economic growth in this country. Call for third party Although Mitt Romney was endorsed by Cain on May 15 2012 he would eventually lose the general election to President Obama. Cain then told Bryan Fischer that the Republican Party no longer represented the interests of conservatives in the United States and that it did not have the ability to rebrand itself. He asserted that legitimate third party would be needed to replace it. Personal life Cain married Gloria Etchison of Atlanta soon after her graduation from Morris Brown College in 1968. The couple had two children Melanie and Vincent and four grandchildren.Cain served as an associate minister at the Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta which he joined at the age of 10. The church is part of the National Baptist Convention and is politically liberal and theologically conservative. The church 's senior pastor Rev. Cameron M. Alexander did not share Cain 's political philosophy.Disclosures filed during Cain 's 2011 campaign categorized his wealth at that time as being between 2.9 and 6.6 million with Cain 's combined income for both 2010 and 2011 being between 1.1 and 2.1 million.

Album,An album is collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc CD vinyl audio tape or another medium such as digital distribution. Albums of recorded sound were developed in the early 20th century as individual 78 rpm records collected in bound book resembling photograph album this format evolved after 1948 into single vinyl long-playing LP records played at 33+1⁄3 rpm. The album was the dominant form of recorded music expression and consumption from the mid-1960s to the early 21st century period known as the album era. Vinyl LPs are still issued though album sales in the 21st-century have mostly focused on CD and MP3 formats. The 8-track tape was the first tape format widely used alongside vinyl from 1965 until being phased out by 1983 and was gradually supplanted by the cassette tape during the 1970s and early 1980s the popularity of the cassette reached its peak during the late 1980s sharply declined during the 1990s and had largely disappeared during the first decade of the 2000s. Most albums are recorded in studio although they may also be recorded in concert venue at home in the field or mix of places. The time frame for completely recording an album varies between few hours to several years. This process usually requires several takes with different parts recorded separately and then brought or mixed together. Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing are termed live even when done in studio. Studios are built to absorb sound eliminating reverberation to assist in mixing different takes other locations such as concert venues and some live rooms have reverberation which creates live sound. Recordings including live may contain editing sound effects voice adjustments etc. With modern recording technology artists can be recorded in separate rooms or at separate times while listening to the other parts using headphones with each part recorded as separate track. Album covers and liner notes are used and sometimes additional information is provided such as analysis of the recording and lyrics or librettos. Historically the term album was applied to collection of various items housed in book format. In musical usage the word was used for collections of short pieces of printed music from the early nineteenth century. Later collections of related 78 rpm records were bundled in book-like albums one side of 78 rpm record could hold only about 3.5 minutes of sound. When LP records were introduced collection of pieces or songs on single record was called an album the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc MiniDisc compact audio cassette 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced.,An album is collection of audio recordings issued on compact disc CD vinyl audio tape or another medium such as digital distribution.

History An album Latin albus white in ancient Rome was board chalked or painted white on which decrees edicts and other public notices were inscribed in black. It was from this that in medieval and modern times album came to denote book of blank pages in which verses autographs sketches photographs and the like are collected. This in turn led to the modern meaning of an album as collection of audio recordings issued as single item. In the early nineteenth century album was occasionally used in the titles of some classical music sets such as Robert Schumann 's Album for the Young Opus 68 set of 43 short pieces.With the advent of 78 rpm records in the early 1900s the typical 10-inch disc could only hold about three minutes of sound per side so almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. Classical-music and spoken-word items generally were released on the longer 12-inch 78s playing around 4–5 minutes per side. For example in 1924 George Gershwin recorded drastically shortened version of his new seventeen-minute composition Rhapsody in Blue with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. The recording was issued on both sides of single record Victor 55225 and ran for 8m 59s. By 1910 though some European record companies had issued albums of complete operas and other works the practice of issuing albums was not widely taken up by American record companies until the 1920s. By about 1910 bound collections of empty sleeves with paperboard or leather cover similar to photograph album were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records the term record album was printed on some covers. These albums came in both 10-inch and 12-inch sizes. The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside allowing the record album to be placed on shelf upright like book suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them. In the 1930s record companies began issuing collections of 78 rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover. Most albums included three or four records with two sides each making six or eight compositions per album.The 10-inch and 12-inch LP record long play or 33+1⁄3 rpm microgroove vinyl record is gramophone record format introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. single LP record often had the same or similar number of tunes as typical album of 78s and it was adopted by the record industry as standard format for the album. Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. The term album was extended to other recording media such as 8-track tape audio cassette compact disc MiniDisc and digital albums as they were introduced. As part of trend of shifting sales in the music industry some observers feel that the early 21st century experienced the death of the album. Length An album may contain any number of tracks. In the United States The Recording Academy 's rules for Grammy Awards state that an album must comprise minimum total playing time of 15 minutes with at least five distinct tracks or minimum total playing time of 30 minutes with no minimum track requirement. In the United Kingdom the criteria for the UK Albums Chart is that recording counts as an album if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than 25 minutes. Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as mini-albums or EPs. Albums such as Tubular Bells Amarok and Hergest Ridge by Mike Oldfield and Yes Close to the Edge include fewer than four tracks but still surpass the 25-minute mark. The album Dopesmoker by Sleep contains only single track but the composition is over 63 minutes long. There are no formal rules against artists such as Pinhead Gunpowder referring to their own releases under thirty minutes as albums. If an album becomes too long to fit onto single vinyl record or CD it may be released as double album where two vinyl LPs or compact discs are packaged together in single case or triple album containing three LPs or compact discs. Recording artists who have an extensive back catalogue may re-release several CDs in one single box with unified design often containing one or more albums in this scenario these releases can sometimes be referred to as two or three -fer or compilation of previously unreleased recordings. These are known as box sets. Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once in the form of boxed sets although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album. Tracks Material music or sounds is stored on an album in sections termed tracks normally 12 tracks. music track often simply referred to as track is an individual song or instrumental recording. The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles. When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side. On compact disc the track number is indexed so that player can jump straight to the start of any track. On digital music stores such as iTunes the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content. track that has the same name as the album is called the title track. Bonus tracks bonus track also known as bonus cut or bonus is piece of music which has been included as an extra. This may be done as marketing promotion or for other reasons. It is not uncommon to include singles B-sides live recordings and demo recordings as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums where those tracks were n't originally included. Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves bonus tracks may be included if customer buys whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist. The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as stand-alone download adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album. In contrast to hidden tracks bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have gap of silence between other album tracks. Bonus tracks on CD or vinyl albums are common in Japan for releases by European and North American artists since importing international copies of the album can be cheaper than buying domestically released version Japanese releases often feature bonus tracks to incentivize domestic purchase. Audio formats Non-audio printed format Commercial sheet music are published in conjunction with the release of new album studio compilation soundtrack etc. matching folio songbook is compilation of the music notation of all the songs included in that particular album. It typically has the album 's artwork on its cover and in addition to sheet music it includes photos of the artist. Most pop and rock releases come in standard Piano/Vocal/Guitar notation format and occasionally Easy Piano E-Z Play Today. Rock-oriented releases may also come in Guitar Recorded Versions edition which are note-for-note transcriptions written directly from artist recordings. Vinyl records Vinyl LP records have two sides each comprising one-half of the album. If pop or rock album contained tracks released separately as commercial singles they were conventionally placed in particular positions on the album. During the Sixties particularly in the UK singles were generally released separately from albums. Today many commercial albums of music tracks feature one or more singles which are released separately to radio TV or the Internet as way of promoting the album. Albums have been issued that are compilations of older tracks not originally released together such as singles not originally found on albums b-sides of singles or unfinished demo recordings.Double albums during the Seventies were sometimes sequenced for record changers. In the case of two-record set for example sides and would be stamped on one record and sides and on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an automatic record changer with side on the bottom and side on the other record on top. Side would automatically drop onto the turntable and be played. When finished the tone arm 's position would trigger mechanism which moved the arm out of the way dropped the record with side and played it. When both records had been played the user would pick up the stack turn it over and put them back on the spindle—sides and would then play in sequence. Record changers were used for many years of the LP era but eventually fell out of use. 8-track tape 8-track tape formally Stereo commonly known as the eight-track cartridge eight-track tape or simply eight-track is magnetic tape sound recording technology popular in the United States from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s when the Compact Cassette format took over. The format is regarded as an obsolete technology and was relatively unknown outside the United States the United Kingdom Canada and Australia.Stereo was created in 1964 by consortium led by Bill Lear of Lear Jet Corporation along with Ampex Ford Motor Company General Motors Motorola and RCA Victor Records RCA. It was further development of the similar Stereo-Pak four-track cartridge created by Earl Madman Muntz. later quadraphonic version of the format was announced by RCA in April 1970 and first known as Quad-8 then later changed to just Q8. Compact cassette The Compact Cassette was popular medium for distributing pre-recorded music from the early 1970s to the early 2000s. The first Compact Cassette was introduced by Philips in August 1963 in the form of prototype. Compact Cassettes became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony Walkman which allowed the person to control what they listened to. The Walkman was convenient because of its size the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with clip for belts or pants.The compact cassette used double-sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale. The music is recorded on both the and side of the tape with cassette being turned to play the other side of the album. Compact Cassettes were also popular way for musicians to record Demos or Demo Tapes of their music to distribute to various record labels in the hopes of acquiring recording contract.Compact cassettes also saw the creation of mixtapes which are tapes containing compilation of songs created by any average listener of music. The songs on mixtape generally relate to one another in some way whether it be conceptual theme or an overall sound. After the introduction of Compact discs the term Mixtape began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format.The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the 1990s after the release and distribution Compact Discs. The 2010s saw revival of Compact Cassettes by independent record labels and DIY musicians who preferred the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet. Compact disc The compact disc format replaced both the vinyl record and the cassette as the standard for the commercial mass-market distribution of physical music albums. After the introduction of music downloading and MP3 players such as the iPod US album sales dropped 54.6 from 2001 to 2009. The CD is digital data storage device which permits digital recording technology to be used to record and play-back the recorded music. MP3 albums and similar Most recently the MP3 audio format has matured revolutionizing the concept of digital storage. Early MP3 albums were essentially CD-rips created by early CD-ripping software and sometimes real-time rips from cassettes and vinyl. The so-called MP3 album is not necessarily just in MP3 file format in which higher quality formats such as FLAC and WAV can be used on storage media that MP3 albums reside on such as CD-R-ROMs hard drives flash memory e.g. thumbdrives MP3 players SD cards etc. Types of album The contents of the album are usually recorded in studio or live in concert though may be recorded in other locations such as at home as with JJ Cale 's Okie Beck 's Odelay David Gray 's White Ladder and others in the field as with early Blues recordings in prison or with mobile recording unit such as the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Studio Most albums are studio albums that is they are recorded in recording studio with equipment meant to give those overseeing the recording as much control as possible over the sound of the album. They minimize external noises and reverberations and have highly sensitive microphones and sound mixing equipment. In some studios each member of band records their part in separate rooms or even at separate times while listening to the other parts of the track with headphones to keep the timing right. In the 2000s with the advent of digital recording it became possible for musicians to record their part of song in another studio in another part of the world and send their contribution over digital channels to be included in the final product. Live Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing or multi-tracking are termed live even when done in studio. However the common understanding of live album is one that was recorded at concert with public audience even when the recording is overdubbed or multi-tracked. Concert or stage performances are recorded using remote recording techniques. Albums may be recorded at single concert or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause laughter and other noise from the audience monologues by the performers between pieces improvisation and so on. They may use multitrack recording direct from the stage sound system rather than microphones placed among the audience and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording. Notable early live albums include the double album of Benny Goodman The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert released in 1950. Live double albums later became popular during the 1970s. Appraising the concept in Christgau 's Record Guide Rock Albums of the Seventies 1981 Robert Christgau said most are profit-taking recaps marred by sound and format inappropriate to phonographic reproduction you ca n't put sights smells or fellowship on audio tape. But for Joe Cocker and Bette Midler and Bob-Dylan-in-the-arena the form makes compelling kind of sense. Eric Clapton 's Unplugged 1992 over 26 million copies Garth Brooks Double Live 1998 over 21 million copies and Peter Frampton 's Frampton Comes Alive. 1976 over 11 million copies are among the best selling live albums. In Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 18 albums were live albums. Solo solo album in popular music is an album recorded by current or former member of musical group which is released under that artist 's name only even though some or all other band members may be involved. The solo album appeared as early as the late 1940s. 1947 Billboard magazine article heralded Margaret Whiting huddling with Capitol execs over her first solo album on which she will be backed by Frank De Vol. There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation band member can solicit from other members of their band and still have the album referred to as solo album. One reviewer wrote that Ringo Starr 's third venture Ringo echnically ... was n't solo album because all four Beatles appeared on it. Three of the four members of the Beatles released solo albums while the group was officially still together. performer may record solo album for several reasons. solo performer working with other members will typically have full creative control of the band be able to hire and fire accompanists and get the majority of the proceeds. The performer may be able to produce songs that differ widely from the sound of the band with which the performer has been associated or that the group as whole chose not to include in its own albums. Graham Nash of The Hollies described his experience in developing solo album as follows The thing that go through that results in solo album is an interesting process of collecting songs that ca n't be done for whatever reason by lot of people. solo album may also represent the departure of the performer from the group. Compilation album compilation album is collection of material from various recording projects or various artists assembled with theme such as the greatest hits from one artist B-sides and rarities by one artist or selections from record label musical genre certain time period or regional music scene.

Most web browsers display the URL of web page above the page in an address bar. typical URL could have the form http //www.example.com/index.html which indicates protocol http hostname www.example.com and file name index.html. History Uniform Resource Locators were defined in RFC 1738 in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee the inventor of the World Wide Web and the URI working group of the Internet Engineering Task Force IETF as an outcome of collaboration started at the IETF Living Documents birds of feather session in 1992.The format combines the pre-existing system of domain names created in 1985 with file path syntax where slashes are used to separate directory and filenames. Conventions already existed where server names could be prefixed to complete file paths preceded by double slash // .Berners-Lee later expressed regret at the use of dots to separate the parts of the domain name within URIs wishing he had used slashes throughout and also said that given the colon following the first component of URI the two slashes before the domain name were unnecessary.An early 1993 draft of the HTML Specification referred to Universal Resource Locators. This was dropped some time between June 1994 RFC 1630 and October 1994 draft-ietf-uri-url-08.txt. Syntax Every HTTP URL conforms to the syntax of generic URI. The URI generic syntax consists of five components organized hierarchically in order of decreasing significance from left to right URI scheme // authority path. query fragment component is undefined if it has an associated delimiter and the delimiter does not appear in the URI the scheme and path components are always defined. component is empty if it has no characters the scheme component is always non-empty.The authority component consists of subcomponents authority userinfo host port This is represented in syntax diagram as The URI comprises non-empty scheme component followed by colon consisting of sequence of characters beginning with letter and followed by any combination of letters digits plus period. or hyphen. Although schemes are case-insensitive the canonical form is lowercase and documents that specify schemes must do so with lowercase letters. Examples of popular schemes include http https ftp mailto file data and irc. URI schemes should be registered with the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority IANA although non-registered schemes are used in practice. An optional authority component preceded by two slashes // comprising An optional userinfo subcomponent followed by an at symbol that may consist of user name and an optional password preceded by colon. Use of the format username password in the userinfo subcomponent is deprecated for security reasons. Applications should not render as clear text any data after the first colon found within userinfo subcomponent unless the data after the colon is the empty string indicating no password. host subcomponent consisting of either registered name including but not limited to hostname or an IP address. IPv4 addresses must be in dot-decimal notation and IPv6 addresses must be enclosed in brackets. An optional port subcomponent preceded by colon consisting of decimal digits. path component consisting of sequence of path segments separated by slash. path is always defined for URI though the defined path may be empty zero length. segment may also be empty resulting in two consecutive slashes // in the path component. path component may resemble or map exactly to file system path but does not always imply relation to one. If an authority component is defined then the path component must either be empty or begin with slash. If an authority component is undefined then the path can not begin with an empty segment—that is with two slashes // —since the following characters would be interpreted as an authority component.By convention in http and https URIs the last part of path is named pathinfo and it is optional. It is composed by zero or more path segments that do not refer to an existing physical resource name e.g. file an internal module program or an executable program but to logical part e.g. command or qualifier part that has to be passed separately to the first part of the path that identifies an executable module or program managed by web server this is often used to select dynamic content document etc. or to tailor it as requested see also CGI and PATH_INFO etc. Example URI http //www.example.com/questions/3456/my-document where /questions is the first part of the path an executable module or program and /3456/my-document is the second part of the path named pathinfo which is passed to the executable module or program named /questions to select the requested document. An http or https URI containing pathinfo part without query part may also be referred to as 'clean URL whose last part may be 'slug'.An optional query component preceded by question mark. consisting of query string of non-hierarchical data. Its syntax is not well defined but by convention is most often sequence of attribute–value pairs separated by delimiter. An optional fragment component preceded by hash. The fragment contains fragment identifier providing direction to secondary resource such as section heading in an article identified by the remainder of the URI. When the primary resource is an HTML document the fragment is often an id attribute of specific element and web browsers will scroll this element into view.A web browser will usually dereference URL by performing an HTTP request to the specified host by default on port number 80. URLs using the https scheme require that requests and responses be made over secure connection to the website. Internationalized URL Internet users are distributed throughout the world using wide variety of languages and alphabets and expect to be able to create URLs in their own local alphabets. An Internationalized Resource Identifier IRI is form of URL that includes Unicode characters. All modern browsers support IRIs. The parts of the URL requiring special treatment for different alphabets are the domain name and path.The domain name in the IRI is known as an Internationalized Domain Name IDN. Web and Internet software automatically convert the domain name into punycode usable by the Domain Name System for example the Chinese URL http //例子.卷筒纸 becomes http //xn -- fsqu00a.xn -- 3lr804guic/. The xn -- indicates that the character was not originally ASCII.The URL path name can also be specified by the user in the local writing system. If not already encoded it is converted to UTF-8 and any characters not part of the basic URL character set are escaped as hexadecimal using percent-encoding for example the Japanese URL http //example.com/引き割り.html becomes http //example.com/ E5 BC 95 E3 81 8D E5 89 B2 E3 82 8A.html.

Alongside successful music career Usher is also acclaimed for involvement in humanitarian causes and is the founder of Usher 's New Look foundation. Early life Usher Raymond IV was born on October 14 1978 in Dallas Texas. His parents were Jonetta Patton née O'Neal from Tennessee and Usher Raymond III. He spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga Tennessee. His father left the family when Usher was year old. Usher grew up with his mother then-stepfather and half-brother James Lackey born 1984. Directed by his mother Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga when he was nine years old. There his grandmother discovered his ability to sing although it was not until Usher joined singing group that she considered he could sing professionally. Believing that bigger city would provide greater opportunities for showcasing his talent Usher 's family moved to Atlanta Georgia where there was more conducive environment for beginning singers. While in Atlanta he attended North Springs High School. Career Late 1980s–1996 Musical beginnings and Usher At age ten Usher joined an local quintet called the NuBeginnings which was organized by local music promoter Darryl Wheeler. Usher recorded ten songs with the group in 1991 and the ensuing album Nubeginning Featuring Usher Raymond IV was only made available regionally and by mail order. However Patton took him out because according to her it was bad experience. The album was re-released nationally in April 2002 by Hip-O Records.At age 13 Usher met A.J. Alexander at local talent show in Atlanta. Alexander who at the time was Bobby Brown 's bodyguard would take Usher around and have him perform in parking lots and talent shows. Alexander invited Bryant Reid an representative from LaFace Records to see Usher perform on the television talent show Star Search. Following the performance he arranged an audition for Usher with L.A. Reid the co-founder of LaFace Reid signed Usher on the spot to contract with the record company after Usher sang Boyz II Men hit record End of the Road. Usher 's mother left her job as medical technician to manage his career. Usher was introduced to the public on Call Me Mack song he recorded for the soundtrack album to the 1993 drama-romance film Poetic Justice.

Usher was going through puberty and had difficult time adjusting his voice. LA Reid became skeptical of Usher and put his album on hold he thought about dropping him from the label. Usher pleaded with the label to keep him and they did. From this point Reid did n't know what to do with Usher so he sent him to New York in the spring of 1994 to live with record executive Puff Daddy to attend what Reid called Flavor Camp. Usher quickly adapted to the lavish lifestyle of Puff Daddy although in an interview with Rolling Stone he described this period as the hardest days of his life. had to knuckle up figure shit out in New York he said.On August 30 1994 LaFace released Usher 's self-titled debut album behind the co-executive production of Sean Diddy Combs.

When LP records were introduced collection of pieces or songs on single record was called an album the word was extended to other recording media such as compact disc MiniDisc compact audio cassette 8-track tape and digital albums as they were introduced. History An album Latin albus white in ancient Rome was board chalked or painted white on which decrees edicts and other public notices were inscribed in black. It was from this that in medieval and modern times album came to denote book of blank pages in which verses autographs sketches photographs and the like are collected. This in turn led to the modern meaning of an album as collection of audio recordings issued as single item. In the early nineteenth century album was occasionally used in the titles of some classical music sets such as Robert Schumann 's Album for the Young Opus 68 set of 43 short pieces.With the advent of 78 rpm records in the early 1900s the typical 10-inch disc could only hold about three minutes of sound per side so almost all popular recordings were limited to around three minutes in length. Classical-music and spoken-word items generally were released on the longer 12-inch 78s playing around 4–5 minutes per side. For example in 1924 George Gershwin recorded drastically shortened version of his new seventeen-minute composition Rhapsody in Blue with Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra. The recording was issued on both sides of single record Victor 55225 and ran for 8m 59s. By 1910 though some European record companies had issued albums of complete operas and other works the practice of issuing albums was not widely taken up by American record companies until the 1920s. By about 1910 bound collections of empty sleeves with paperboard or leather cover similar to photograph album were sold as record albums that customers could use to store their records the term record album was printed on some covers. These albums came in both 10-inch and 12-inch sizes. The covers of these bound books were wider and taller than the records inside allowing the record album to be placed on shelf upright like book suspending the fragile records above the shelf and protecting them. In the 1930s record companies began issuing collections of 78 rpm records by one performer or of one type of music in specially assembled albums typically with artwork on the front cover and liner notes on the back or inside cover. Most albums included three or four records with two sides each making six or eight compositions per album.The 10-inch and 12-inch LP record long play or 33+1⁄3 rpm microgroove vinyl record is gramophone record format introduced by Columbia Records in 1948. single LP record often had the same or similar number of tunes as typical album of 78s and it was adopted by the record industry as standard format for the album. Apart from relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound capability it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums. The term album was extended to other recording media such as 8-track tape audio cassette compact disc MiniDisc and digital albums as they were introduced. As part of trend of shifting sales in the music industry some observers feel that the early 21st century experienced the death of the album. Length An album may contain any number of tracks. In the United States The Recording Academy 's rules for Grammy Awards state that an album must comprise minimum total playing time of 15 minutes with at least five distinct tracks or minimum total playing time of 30 minutes with no minimum track requirement. In the United Kingdom the criteria for the UK Albums Chart is that recording counts as an album if it either has more than four tracks or lasts more than 25 minutes. Sometimes shorter albums are referred to as mini-albums or EPs. Albums such as Tubular Bells Amarok and Hergest Ridge by Mike Oldfield and Yes Close to the Edge include fewer than four tracks but still surpass the 25-minute mark. The album Dopesmoker by Sleep contains only single track but the composition is over 63 minutes long. There are no formal rules against artists such as Pinhead Gunpowder referring to their own releases under thirty minutes as albums. If an album becomes too long to fit onto single vinyl record or CD it may be released as double album where two vinyl LPs or compact discs are packaged together in single case or triple album containing three LPs or compact discs. Recording artists who have an extensive back catalogue may re-release several CDs in one single box with unified design often containing one or more albums in this scenario these releases can sometimes be referred to as two or three -fer or compilation of previously unreleased recordings. These are known as box sets. Some musical artists have also released more than three compact discs or LP records of new recordings at once in the form of boxed sets although in that case the work is still usually considered to be an album. Tracks Material music or sounds is stored on an album in sections termed tracks normally 12 tracks. music track often simply referred to as track is an individual song or instrumental recording. The term is particularly associated with popular music where separate tracks are known as album tracks the term is also used for other formats such as EPs and singles. When vinyl records were the primary medium for audio recordings track could be identified visually from the grooves and many album covers or sleeves included numbers for the tracks on each side. On compact disc the track number is indexed so that player can jump straight to the start of any track. On digital music stores such as iTunes the term song is often used interchangeably with track regardless of whether there is any vocal content. track that has the same name as the album is called the title track. Bonus tracks bonus track also known as bonus cut or bonus is piece of music which has been included as an extra. This may be done as marketing promotion or for other reasons. It is not uncommon to include singles B-sides live recordings and demo recordings as bonus tracks on re-issues of old albums where those tracks were n't originally included. Online music stores allow buyers to create their own albums by selecting songs themselves bonus tracks may be included if customer buys whole album rather than just one or two songs from the artist. The song is not necessarily free nor is it available as stand-alone download adding also to the incentive to buy the complete album. In contrast to hidden tracks bonus tracks are included on track listings and usually do not have gap of silence between other album tracks. Bonus tracks on CD or vinyl albums are common in Japan for releases by European and North American artists since importing international copies of the album can be cheaper than buying domestically released version Japanese releases often feature bonus tracks to incentivize domestic purchase. Audio formats Non-audio printed format Commercial sheet music are published in conjunction with the release of new album studio compilation soundtrack etc. matching folio songbook is compilation of the music notation of all the songs included in that particular album. It typically has the album 's artwork on its cover and in addition to sheet music it includes photos of the artist. Most pop and rock releases come in standard Piano/Vocal/Guitar notation format and occasionally Easy Piano E-Z Play Today. Rock-oriented releases may also come in Guitar Recorded Versions edition which are note-for-note transcriptions written directly from artist recordings. Vinyl records Vinyl LP records have two sides each comprising one-half of the album. If pop or rock album contained tracks released separately as commercial singles they were conventionally placed in particular positions on the album. During the Sixties particularly in the UK singles were generally released separately from albums. Today many commercial albums of music tracks feature one or more singles which are released separately to radio TV or the Internet as way of promoting the album. Albums have been issued that are compilations of older tracks not originally released together such as singles not originally found on albums b-sides of singles or unfinished demo recordings.Double albums during the Seventies were sometimes sequenced for record changers. In the case of two-record set for example sides and would be stamped on one record and sides and on the other. The user would stack the two records onto the spindle of an automatic record changer with side on the bottom and side on the other record on top. Side would automatically drop onto the turntable and be played. When finished the tone arm 's position would trigger mechanism which moved the arm out of the way dropped the record with side and played it. When both records had been played the user would pick up the stack turn it over and put them back on the spindle—sides and would then play in sequence. Record changers were used for many years of the LP era but eventually fell out of use. 8-track tape 8-track tape formally Stereo commonly known as the eight-track cartridge eight-track tape or simply eight-track is magnetic tape sound recording technology popular in the United States from the mid-1960s to the late 1970s when the Compact Cassette format took over. The format is regarded as an obsolete technology and was relatively unknown outside the United States the United Kingdom Canada and Australia.Stereo was created in 1964 by consortium led by Bill Lear of Lear Jet Corporation along with Ampex Ford Motor Company General Motors Motorola and RCA Victor Records RCA. It was further development of the similar Stereo-Pak four-track cartridge created by Earl Madman Muntz. later quadraphonic version of the format was announced by RCA in April 1970 and first known as Quad-8 then later changed to just Q8. Compact cassette The Compact Cassette was popular medium for distributing pre-recorded music from the early 1970s to the early 2000s. The first Compact Cassette was introduced by Philips in August 1963 in the form of prototype. Compact Cassettes became especially popular during the 1980s after the advent of the Sony Walkman which allowed the person to control what they listened to. The Walkman was convenient because of its size the device could fit in most pockets and often came equipped with clip for belts or pants.The compact cassette used double-sided magnetic tape to distribute music for commercial sale. The music is recorded on both the and side of the tape with cassette being turned to play the other side of the album. Compact Cassettes were also popular way for musicians to record Demos or Demo Tapes of their music to distribute to various record labels in the hopes of acquiring recording contract.Compact cassettes also saw the creation of mixtapes which are tapes containing compilation of songs created by any average listener of music. The songs on mixtape generally relate to one another in some way whether it be conceptual theme or an overall sound. After the introduction of Compact discs the term Mixtape began to apply to any personal compilation of songs on any given format.The sales of Compact Cassettes eventually began to decline in the 1990s after the release and distribution Compact Discs. The 2010s saw revival of Compact Cassettes by independent record labels and DIY musicians who preferred the format because of its difficulty to share over the internet. Compact disc The compact disc format replaced both the vinyl record and the cassette as the standard for the commercial mass-market distribution of physical music albums. After the introduction of music downloading and MP3 players such as the iPod US album sales dropped 54.6 from 2001 to 2009. The CD is digital data storage device which permits digital recording technology to be used to record and play-back the recorded music. MP3 albums and similar Most recently the MP3 audio format has matured revolutionizing the concept of digital storage. Early MP3 albums were essentially CD-rips created by early CD-ripping software and sometimes real-time rips from cassettes and vinyl. The so-called MP3 album is not necessarily just in MP3 file format in which higher quality formats such as FLAC and WAV can be used on storage media that MP3 albums reside on such as CD-R-ROMs hard drives flash memory e.g. thumbdrives MP3 players SD cards etc. Types of album The contents of the album are usually recorded in studio or live in concert though may be recorded in other locations such as at home as with JJ Cale 's Okie Beck 's Odelay David Gray 's White Ladder and others in the field as with early Blues recordings in prison or with mobile recording unit such as the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. Studio Most albums are studio albums that is they are recorded in recording studio with equipment meant to give those overseeing the recording as much control as possible over the sound of the album. They minimize external noises and reverberations and have highly sensitive microphones and sound mixing equipment. In some studios each member of band records their part in separate rooms or even at separate times while listening to the other parts of the track with headphones to keep the timing right. In the 2000s with the advent of digital recording it became possible for musicians to record their part of song in another studio in another part of the world and send their contribution over digital channels to be included in the final product. Live Recordings that are done in one take without overdubbing or multi-tracking are termed live even when done in studio. However the common understanding of live album is one that was recorded at concert with public audience even when the recording is overdubbed or multi-tracked. Concert or stage performances are recorded using remote recording techniques. Albums may be recorded at single concert or combine recordings made at multiple concerts. They may include applause laughter and other noise from the audience monologues by the performers between pieces improvisation and so on. They may use multitrack recording direct from the stage sound system rather than microphones placed among the audience and can employ additional manipulation and effects during post-production to enhance the quality of the recording. Notable early live albums include the double album of Benny Goodman The Famous 1938 Carnegie Hall Jazz Concert released in 1950. Live double albums later became popular during the 1970s. Appraising the concept in Christgau 's Record Guide Rock Albums of the Seventies 1981 Robert Christgau said most are profit-taking recaps marred by sound and format inappropriate to phonographic reproduction you ca n't put sights smells or fellowship on audio tape. But for Joe Cocker and Bette Midler and Bob-Dylan-in-the-arena the form makes compelling kind of sense. Eric Clapton 's Unplugged 1992 over 26 million copies Garth Brooks Double Live 1998 over 21 million copies and Peter Frampton 's Frampton Comes Alive. 1976 over 11 million copies are among the best selling live albums. In Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time 18 albums were live albums. Solo solo album in popular music is an album recorded by current or former member of musical group which is released under that artist 's name only even though some or all other band members may be involved. The solo album appeared as early as the late 1940s. 1947 Billboard magazine article heralded Margaret Whiting huddling with Capitol execs over her first solo album on which she will be backed by Frank De Vol. There is no formal definition setting forth the amount of participation band member can solicit from other members of their band and still have the album referred to as solo album. One reviewer wrote that Ringo Starr 's third venture Ringo echnically ... was n't solo album because all four Beatles appeared on it. Three of the four members of the Beatles released solo albums while the group was officially still together. performer may record solo album for several reasons. solo performer working with other members will typically have full creative control of the band be able to hire and fire accompanists and get the majority of the proceeds. The performer may be able to produce songs that differ widely from the sound of the band with which the performer has been associated or that the group as whole chose not to include in its own albums. Graham Nash of The Hollies described his experience in developing solo album as follows The thing that go through that results in solo album is an interesting process of collecting songs that ca n't be done for whatever reason by lot of people. solo album may also represent the departure of the performer from the group. Compilation album compilation album is collection of material from various recording projects or various artists assembled with theme such as the greatest hits from one artist B-sides and rarities by one artist or selections from record label musical genre certain time period or regional music scene. Promotional sampler albums are compilations. ==== Tribute or cover ==== tribute or cover album is compilation of cover versions of songs or instrumental compositions. Its concept may involve various artists covering the songs of single artist genre or period single artist covering the songs of various artists or single artist genre or period or any variation of an album of cover songs which is marketed as tribute.

Android (operating system),Android is mobile operating system based on modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance though its most widely used version is primarily developed by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007 with the first commercial Android device the HTC Dream being launched in September 2008. At its core the operating system is known as Android Open Source Project AOSP and is free and open-source software FOSS primarily licensed under the Apache License. However most devices run on the proprietary Android version developed by Google which ship with additional proprietary closed-source software pre-installed most notably Google Mobile Services GMS which includes core apps such as Google Chrome the digital distribution platform Google Play and the associated Google Play Services development platform. While AOSP is free the Android name and logo are trademarks of Google which imposes standards to restrict the use of Android branding by uncertified devices outside their ecosystem.Over 70 percent of smartphones based on Android Open Source Project run Google 's ecosystem which is known simply as Android some with vendor-customized user interfaces and software suites such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung and HTC Sense. Competing ecosystems and forks of AOSP include Fire OS developed by Amazon ColorOS by OPPO OriginOS by Vivo MagicUI by Honor or custom ROMs such as LineageOS. The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on range of other electronics such as game consoles digital cameras portable media players and PCs each with specialized user interface. Some well known derivatives include Android TV for televisions and Wear OS for wearables both developed by Google. Software packages on Android which use the APK format are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store Amazon Appstore including for Windows 11 Samsung Galaxy Store Huawei AppGallery Cafe Bazaar and GetJar or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid. Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2021 it had over three billion monthly active users the largest installed base of any operating system and as of January 2021 the Google Play Store featured over million apps.

History Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto California in October 2003 by Andy Rubin Rich Miner Nick Sears and Chris White. Rubin described the Android project as having tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner 's location and preferences. The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004. The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.Rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on and Android was facing eviction from its office space. Steve Perlman close friend of Rubin brought him 10,000 in cash in an envelope and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding. Perlman refused stake in the company and has stated did it because believed in the thing and wanted to help Andy. In 2005 Rubin tried to negotiate deals with Samsung and HTC. Shortly afterwards Google acquired the company in July of that year for at least 50 million this was Google 's best deal ever according to Google 's then-vice president of corporate development David Lawee in 2010. Android 's key employees including Rubin Miner Sears and White joined Google as part of the acquisition. Not much was known about the secretive Android Inc. at the time with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones. At Google the team led by Rubin developed mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing flexible upgradeable system. Google had lined up series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation .Speculation about Google 's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006. An early prototype had close resemblance to BlackBerry phone with no touchscreen and physical QWERTY keyboard but the arrival of 2007 's Apple iPhone meant that Android had to go back to the drawing board. Google later changed its Android specification documents to state that Touchscreens will be supported although the Product was designed with the presence of discrete physical buttons as an assumption therefore touchscreen can not completely replace physical buttons. By 2008 both Nokia and BlackBerry announced touch-based smartphones to rival the iPhone 3G and Android 's focus eventually switched to just touchscreens. The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream also known as T-Mobile G1 announced on September 23 2008. On November 2007 the Open Handset Alliance consortium of technology companies including Google device manufacturers such as HTC Motorola and Samsung wireless carriers such as Sprint and T-Mobile and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments unveiled itself with goal to develop the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices. Within year the Open Handset Alliance faced two other open source competitors the Symbian Foundation and the LiMo Foundation the latter also developing Linux-based mobile operating system like Google. In September 2007 InformationWeek covered an Evalueserve study reporting that Google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony.Since 2008 Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after dessert or sugary treat with the first few Android versions being called Cupcake Donut Eclair and Froyo in that order. During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013 Google explained that Since these devices make our lives so sweet each Android version is named after dessert although Google spokesperson told CNN in an interview that It 's kind of like an internal team thing and we prefer to be little bit—how should say—a bit inscrutable in the matter 'll say .In 2010 Google launched its Nexus series of devices lineup in which Google partnered with different device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new Android versions. The series was described as having played pivotal role in Android 's history by introducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board and became known for its bloat-free software with timely ... updates. At its developer conference in May 2013 Google announced special version of the Samsung Galaxy S4 where instead of using Samsung 's own Android customization the phone ran stock Android and was promised to receive new system updates fast. The device would become the start of the Google Play edition program and was followed by other devices including the HTC One Google Play edition and Moto Google Play edition. In 2015 Ars Technica wrote that Earlier this week the last of the Google Play edition Android phones in Google 's online storefront were listed as no longer available for sale and that Now they 're all gone and it looks whole lot like the program has wrapped up. From 2008 to 2013 Hugo Barra served as product spokesperson representing Android at press conferences and Google I/O Google 's annual developer-focused conference. He left Google in August 2013 to join Chinese phone maker Xiaomi. Less than six months earlier Google 's then-CEO Larry Page announced in blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google and that Sundar Pichai would become the new Android lead. Pichai himself would eventually switch positions becoming the new CEO of Google in August 2015 following the company 's restructure into the Alphabet conglomerate making Hiroshi Lockheimer the new head of Android.On Android 4.4 Kit Kat shared writing access to MicroSD memory cards has been locked for user-installed applications to which only the dedicated directories with respective package names located inside Android/data/ remained writeable. Writing access has been reinstated with Android Lollipop through the backwards-incompatible Google Storage Access Framework interface.In June 2014 Google announced Android One set of hardware reference models that would allow device makers to easily create high-quality phones at low costs designed for consumers in developing countries. In September Google announced the first set of Android One phones for release in India. However Recode reported in June 2015 that the project was disappointment citing reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners and misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware. Plans to relaunch Android One surfaced in August 2015 with Africa announced as the next location for the program week later. report from The Information in January 2017 stated that Google is expanding its low-cost Android One program into the United States although The Verge notes that the company will presumably not produce the actual devices itself. Google introduced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in October 2016 marketed as being the first phones made by Google and exclusively featured certain software features such as the Google Assistant before wider rollout. The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series with new generation of Pixel phones launched in October 2017.In May 2019 the operating system became entangled in the trade war between China and the United States involving Huawei which like many other tech firms had become dependent on access to the Android platform. In the summer of 2019 Huawei announced it would create an alternative operating system to Android known as Harmony OS and has filed for intellectual property rights across major global markets. Under such sanctions Huawei has long-term plans to replace Android in 2022 with the new operating system as Harmony OS was originally designed for internet of things devices rather than for smartphones and tablets.On August 22 2019 it was announced that Android would officially be branded as Android 10 ending the historic practice of naming major versions after desserts. Google stated that these names were not inclusive to international users due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known or being difficult to pronounce in some languages. On the same day Android Police reported that Google had commissioned statue of giant number 10 to be installed in the lobby of the developers new office. Android 10 was released on September 2019 to Google Pixel phones first. In late 2021 some users reported that they were unable to dial emergency services. The problem was caused by combination of bugs in Android and in the Microsoft Teams app both companies released updates addressing the issue. Features Interface Android 's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions like swiping tapping pinching and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects along with virtual keyboard. Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB. The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides fluid touch interface often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware such as accelerometers gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented or allowing the user to steer vehicle in racing game by rotating the device simulating control of steering wheel. ==== Home screen ==== Android devices boot to the home screen the primary navigation and information hub on Android devices analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. Android home screens are typically made up of app icons and widgets app icons launch the associated app whereas widgets display live auto-updating content such as weather forecast the user 's email inbox or news ticker directly on the home screen. home screen may be made up of several pages between which the user can swipe back and forth. Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the home screen and even mimic the look of other operating systems such as Windows Phone. Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors. ==== Status bar ==== Along the top of the screen is status bar showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be pulled swiped down from to reveal notification screen where apps display important information or updates as well as quick access to system controls and toggles such as display brightness connectivity settings WiFi Bluetooth cellular data audio mode and flashlight. Vendors may implement extended settings such as the ability to adjust the flashlight brightness. ==== Notifications ==== Notifications are short timely and relevant information about your app when it 's not in use and when tapped users are directed to screen inside the app relating to the notification. Beginning with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean expandable notifications allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification. ==== App lists ==== An All Apps screen lists all installed applications with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen. The app list may be accessed using gesture or button depending on the Android version. Recents screen also known as Overview lets users switch between recently used apps.The recent list may appear side-by-side or overlapping depending on the Android version and manufacturer. ==== Navigation buttons ==== Many early Android OS smartphones were equipped with dedicated search button for quick access to web search engine and individual apps internal search feature. More recent devices typically allow the former through long press or swipe away from the home button.The dedicated option key also known as menu key and its on-screen simulation is no longer supported since Android version 10. Google recommends mobile application developers to locate menus within the user interface. On more recent phones its place is occupied by task key used to access the list of recently used apps when actuated. Depending on device its long press may simulate menu button press or engage split screen view the latter of which is the default behaviour since stock Android version. ==== Split-screen view ==== Native support for split screen view has been added in stock Android version 7.0 Nougat.The earliest vendor-customized Android-based smartphones known to have featured split-screen view mode are the 2012 Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note the former of which received this feature with the premium suite upgrade delivered in TouchWiz with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. ==== Charging while powered off ==== When connecting or disconnecting charging power and when shortly actuating the power button or home button all while the device is powered off visual battery meter whose appearance varies among vendors appears on the screen allowing the user to quickly assess the charge status of powered-off without having to boot it up first. Some display the battery percentage. Applications Many to almost all Android devices come with preinstalled Google apps including Gmail Google Maps Google Chrome YouTube Google Play Music Google Play Movies TV and many more. Applications apps which extend the functionality of devices and must be 64-bit are written using the Android software development kit SDK and often Kotlin programming language which replaced Java as Google 's preferred language for Android app development in May 2019 and was originally announced in May 2017. Java is still supported originally the only option for user-space programs and is often mixed with Kotlin as is C++. Java or other JVM languages such as Kotlin may be combined with C/C++ together with choice of non-default runtimes that allow better C++ support. The Go programming language is also supported although with limited set of application programming interfaces API .The SDK includes comprehensive set of development tools including debugger software libraries handset emulator based on QEMU documentation sample code and tutorials. Initially Google 's supported integrated development environment IDE was Eclipse using the Android Development Tools ADT plugin in December 2014 Google released Android Studio based on IntelliJ IDEA as its primary IDE for Android application development. Other development tools are available including native development kit NDK for applications or extensions in or C++ Google App Inventor visual environment for novice programmers and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks. In January 2014 Google unveiled framework based on Apache Cordova for porting Chrome HTML web applications to Android wrapped in native application shell. Additionally Firebase was acquired by Google in 2014 that provides helpful tools for app and web developers.Android has growing selection of third-party applications which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application 's APK Android application package file or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install update and remove applications from their devices. Google Play Store is the primary application store installed on Android devices that comply with Google 's compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software. Google Play Store allows users to browse download and update applications published by Google and third-party developers as of January 2021 there are more than three million applications available for Android in Play Store. As of July 2013 50 billion application installations had been performed. Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for Google Play application purchases where the cost of the application is added to the user 's monthly bill. As of May 2017 there are over one billion active users month for Gmail Android Chrome Google Play and Maps. Due to the open nature of Android number of third-party application marketplaces also exist for Android either to provide substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store provide applications that can not be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the Amazon Appstore GetJar and SlideMe. F-Droid another alternative marketplace seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses.In October 2020 Google removed several Android applications from Play Store as they were identified breaching its data collection rules. The firm was informed by International Digital Accountability Council IDAC that apps for children like Number Coloring Princess Salon and Cats Cosplay with collective downloads of 20 million were violating Google 's policies.At the Windows 11 announcement event in June 2021 Microsoft showcased the new Windows Subsystem for Android WSA that will enable support for the Android Open Source Project AOSP and will allow users to run Android apps on their Windows desktop. Storage The storage of Android devices can be expanded using secondary devices such as SD cards. Android recognizes two types of secondary storage portable storage which is used by default and adoptable storage. Portable storage is treated as an external storage device. Adoptable storage introduced on Android 6.0 allows the internal storage of the device to be spanned with the SD card treating it as an extension of the internal storage. This has the disadvantage of preventing the memory card from being used with another device unless it is reformatted.Android 4.4 introduced the Storage Access Framework SAF set of APIs for accessing files on the device 's filesystem. As of Android 11 Android has required apps to conform to data privacy policy known as scoped storage under which apps may only automatically have access to certain directories such as those for pictures music and video and app-specific directories they have created themselves. Apps are required to use the SAF to access any other part of the filesystem. Memory management Since Android devices are usually battery-powered Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that while available for immediate use rather than closed it does not use battery power or CPU resources. Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically when memory is low the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time. Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task-killer applications were doing more harm than good. Developer options Some settings for use by developers for debugging and power users are located in Developer options sub menu such as the ability to highlight updating parts of the display show an overlay with the current status of the touch screen show touching spots for possible use in screencasting notify the user of unresponsive background processes with the option to end them Show all ANRs i.e. App 's Not Responding prevent Bluetooth audio client from controlling the system volume Disable absolute volume and adjust the duration of transition animations or deactivate them completely to speed up navigation.Developer options are initially hidden since Android 4.2 Jelly Bean but can be enabled by actuating the operating system 's build number in the device information seven times. Hiding developers options again requires deleting user data for the Settings app possibly resetting some other preferences. Hardware The main hardware platform for Android is ARM the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android. The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for x86 architectures ahead of the official support. Since 2012 Android devices with Intel processors began to appear including phones and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64. An unofficial experimental port of the operating system to the RISC-V architecture was released in 2021.Requirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android 7.1 range from in practice GB for best hardware down to GB for the most common screen. Android supports all versions of OpenGL ES and Vulkan and version 1.1 available for some devices. Android devices incorporate many optional hardware components including still or video cameras GPS orientation sensors dedicated gaming controls accelerometers gyroscopes barometers magnetometers proximity sensors pressure sensors thermometers and touchscreens. Some hardware components are not required but became standard in certain classes of devices such as smartphones and additional requirements apply if they are present. Some other hardware was initially required but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example as Android was developed initially as phone OS hardware such as microphones were required while over time the phone function became optional. Android used to require an autofocus camera which was relaxed to fixed-focus camera if present at all since the camera was dropped as requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set-top boxes. In addition to running on smartphones and tablets several vendors run Android natively on regular PC hardware with keyboard and mouse. In addition to their availability on commercially available hardware similar PC hardware-friendly versions of Android are freely available from the Android-x86 project including customized Android 4.4. Using the Android emulator that is part of the Android SDK or third-party emulators Android can also run non-natively on x86 architectures. Chinese companies are building PC and mobile operating system based on Android to compete directly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android. The Chinese Academy of Engineering noted that more than dozen companies were customizing Android following Chinese ban on the use of Windows on government PCs. Development Android is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project AOSP an open source initiative led by Google.The first source code release happened as part of the initial release in 2007. All releases are under the Apache License.The AOSP code can be found with minimal modifications on select devices mainly the former Nexus and current Android One series of devices. However most original equipment manufacturers OEMs customize the source code to run on their hardware.Android 's source code does not contain the device drivers often proprietary that are needed for certain hardware components and does not contain the source code of Google Play Services which many apps depend on. As result most Android devices including Google 's own ship with combination of free and open source and proprietary software with the software required for accessing Google services falling into the latter category. In response to this there are some projects that build complete operating systems based on AOSP as free software the first being CyanogenMod see section Open-source community below. Update schedule Google provides annual Android releases both for factory installation in new devices and for over-the-air updates to existing devices. The latest major release is Android 13. The extensive variation of hardware in Android devices has caused significant delays for software upgrades and security patches. Each upgrade has had to be specifically tailored time- and resource-consuming process. Except for devices within the Google Nexus and Pixel brands updates have often arrived months after the release of the new version or not at all. Manufacturers often prioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind. Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who after receiving updates from manufacturers further customize Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending out the upgrade. There are also situations in which upgrades are impossible due to manufacturer not updating necessary drivers.The lack of after-sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media. Some commentators have noted that the industry has financial incentive not to upgrade their devices as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones an attitude described as insulting. The Guardian complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way. In 2011 Google partnered with number of industry players to announce an Android Update Alliance pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its release however there has not been another official word about that alliance since its announcement.In 2012 Google began de-coupling certain aspects of the operating system particularly its central applications so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS. One of those components Google Play Services is closed-source system-level process providing APIs for Google services installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android 2.2 Froyo and higher. With these changes Google can add new system functions and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself. As result Android 4.2 and 4.3 Jelly Bean contained relatively fewer user-facing changes focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.HTC 's then-executive Jason Mackenzie called monthly security updates unrealistic in 2015 and Google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches from the full testing procedures. In May 2016 Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Google was making efforts to keep Android more up-to-date including accelerated rates of security updates rolling out technological workarounds reducing requirements for phone testing and ranking phone makers in an attempt to shame them into better behavior. As stated by Bloomberg As smartphones get more capable complex and hackable having the latest software work closely with the hardware is increasingly important. Hiroshi Lockheimer the Android lead admitted that It 's not an ideal situation further commenting that the lack of updates is the weakest link on security on Android. Wireless carriers were described in the report as the most challenging discussions due to their slow approval time while testing on their networks despite some carriers including Verizon Wireless and Sprint Corporation already shortening their approval times. In further effort for persuasion Google shared list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its Android partners and is considering making the list public. Mike Chan co-founder of phone maker Nextbit and former Android developer said that The best way to solve this problem is massive re-architecture of the operating system or Google could invest in training manufacturers and carriers 'to be good Android citizens .In May 2017 with the announcement of Android 8.0 Google introduced Project Treble major re-architect of the Android OS framework designed to make it easier faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to newer versions of Android. Project Treble separates the vendor implementation device-specific lower-level software written by silicon manufacturers from the Android OS framework via new vendor interface. In Android 7.0 and earlier no formal vendor interface exists so device makers must update large portions of the Android code to move device to newer version of the operating system. With Treble the new stable vendor interface provides access to the hardware-specific parts of Android enabling device makers to deliver new Android releases simply by updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers. In September 2017 Google 's Project Treble team revealed that as part of their efforts to improve the security lifecycle of Android devices Google had managed to get the Linux Foundation to agree to extend the support lifecycle of the Linux Long-Term Support LTS kernel branch from the years that it has historically lasted to years for future versions of the LTS kernel starting with Linux kernel 4.4.In May 2019 with the announcement of Android 10 Google introduced Project Mainline to simplify and expedite delivery of updates to the Android ecosystem. Project Mainline enables updates to core OS components through the Google Play Store. As result important security and performance improvements that previously needed to be part of full OS updates can be downloaded and installed as easily as an app update.Google reported rolling out new amendments in Android 12 aimed at making the use of third-party application stores easier. This announcement rectified the concerns reported regarding the development of Android apps including fight over an alternative in-app payment system and difficulties faced by businesses moving online because of COVID-19. Linux kernel Android 's kernel is based on the Linux kernel 's long-term support LTS branches. As of 2023 Android uses versions 4.14 4.19 5.4 5.10 or 5.15 of the Linux kernel and since modified Linux kernels is used Android names like android13-5.15 or android-4.19-stable are used. The actual kernel depends on the individual device.Android 's variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle such as the inclusion of components like device trees ashmem ION and different out of memory OOM handling. Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel notably power management feature called wakelocks were initially rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain its own code. Google announced in April 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community but Greg Kroah-Hartman the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux. Google engineer Patrick Brady once stated in the company 's developer conference that Android is not Linux with Computerworld adding that Let me make it simple for you without Linux there is no Android. Ars Technica wrote that Although Android is built on top of the Linux kernel the platform has very little in common with the conventional desktop Linux stack .In August 2011 Linus Torvalds said that eventually Android and Linux would come back to common kernel but it will probably not be for four to five years. that has n't happened yet while some code has been upstreamed not all of it has so modified kernels keep being used. In December 2011 Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project which aims to put some Android drivers patches and features back into the Linux kernel starting in Linux 3.3. Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes to memory the traditional suspend that Android uses and to disk hibernate as it is known on the desktop. Google maintains public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.Android is Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation Google 's open-source chief Chris DiBona and several journalists. Others such as Google engineer Patrick Brady say that Android is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense Android does not include the GNU Library it uses Bionic as an alternative library and some other components typically found in Linux distributions.With the release of Android Oreo in 2017 Google began to require that devices shipped with new SoCs had Linux kernel version 4.4 or newer for security reasons. Existing devices upgraded to Oreo and new products launched with older SoCs were exempt from this rule. Rooting The flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions such as /system/ for the operating system itself and /data/ for user data and application installations.In contrast to typical desktop Linux distributions Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as /system/ are read-only. However root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the capabilities and customizability of their devices but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware. Root access can also be obtained by unlocking the bootloader via the OEM Unlocking option on certain devices including most Google Pixel and OnePlus models. The unlocking process resets the system to factory state erasing all user data. Software stack On top of the Linux kernel there are the middleware libraries and APIs written in and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries. Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of Android 's other source code projects. Android uses Android Runtime ART as its runtime environment introduced in version 4.4 which uses ahead-of-time AOT compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application. In Android 4.4 ART was an experimental feature and not enabled by default it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android 5.0. In versions no longer supported until version 5.0 when ART took over Android previously used Dalvik as process virtual machine with trace-based just-in-time JIT compilation to run Dalvik dex-code Dalvik Executable which is usually translated from the Java bytecode. Following the trace-based JIT principle in addition to interpreting the majority of application code Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments traces each time an application is launched. For its Java library the Android platform uses subset of the now discontinued Apache Harmony project. In December 2015 Google announced that the next version of Android would switch to Java implementation based on the OpenJDK project.Android 's standard library Bionic was developed by Google specifically for Android as derivation of the BSD 's standard library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU Library glibc or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint and optimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time Bionic is licensed under the terms of the BSD licence which Google finds more suitable for the Android 's overall licensing model.Aiming for different licensing model toward the end of 2012 Google switched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed BlueZ to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid. new Bluetooth stack called Gabeldorsche was developed to try to fix the bugs in the BlueDroid implementation.Android does not have native Window System by default nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries. This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android until version r5 of the Android Native Development Kit brought support for applications written completely in or C++. Libraries written in may also be used in applications by injection of small shim and usage of the JNI.In current versions of Android Toybox collection of command-line utilities mostly for use by apps as Android does not provide command-line interface by default is used since the release of Marshmallow replacing similar Toolbox collection found in previous Android versions.Android has another operating system Trusty OS within it as part of Trusty software components supporting Trusted Execution Environment TEE on mobile devices. Trusty and the Trusty API are subject to change. .. Applications for the Trusty OS can be written in C/C++ C++ support is limited and they have access to small library. .. All Trusty applications are single-threaded multithreading in Trusty userspace currently is unsupported. .. Third-party application development is not supported in the current version and software running on the OS and processor for it run the DRM framework for protected content. .. There are many other uses for TEE such as mobile payments secure banking full-disk encryption multi-factor authentication device reset protection replay-protected persistent storage wireless display cast of protected content secure PIN and fingerprint processing and even malware detection. Open-source community Android 's source code is released by Google under an open source license and its open nature has encouraged large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as foundation for community-driven projects which deliver updates to older devices add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels with comparable level of quality provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems such as the HP TouchPad. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device 's processor. CyanogenMod was the most widely used community firmware now discontinued and succeeded by LineageOS.There are as of August 2019 handful of notable custom Android distributions ROMs of the latest Android version 9.0 Pie which was released publicly in August 2018. See List of custom Android distributions. Historically device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party firmware development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this. Moreover modified firmware such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features such as tethering for which carriers would otherwise charge premium. As result technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices. However as community-developed software has grown more popular and following statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the jailbreaking of mobile devices manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development with some including HTC Motorola Samsung and Sony providing support and encouraging development. As result of this over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders similar to Nexus series of phones although usually requiring that users waive their devices warranties to do so. However despite manufacturer acceptance some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down frustrating developers and customers. Device codenames Internally Android identifies each supported device by its device codename short string which may or may not be similar to the model name used in marketing the device. For example the device codename of the Pixel smartphone is sailfish. The device codename is usually not visible to the end user but is important for determining compatibility with modified Android versions. It is sometimes also mentioned in articles discussing device because it allows to distinguish different hardware variants of device even if the manufacturer offers them under the same name. The device codename is available to running applications under android.os.Build.DEVICE. Security and privacy In 2020 Google launched the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative to improve the security of Android. They also formed an Android security team. Common security threats Research from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties. Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially however Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users. Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare and survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5 of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store.In 2021 journalists and researchers reported the discovery of spyware called Pegasus developed and distributed by private company which can and has been used to infect both iOS and Android smartphones often partly via use of 0-day exploits without the need for any user-interaction or significant clues to the user and then be used to exfiltrate data track user locations capture film through its camera and activate the microphone at any time. Analysis of data traffic by popular smartphones running variants of Android found substantial by-default data collection and sharing with no opt-out by this pre-installed software. Both of these issues are not addressed or can not be addressed by security patches. ==== Scope of surveillance by public institutions ==== As part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies the National Security Agency NSA and Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ respectively have access to the user data on iPhone BlackBerry and Android devices. They are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information including SMS location emails and notes. In January 2014 further reports revealed the intelligence agencies capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as Angry Birds which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons. GCHQ has according to The Guardian wiki-style guide of different apps and advertising networks and the different data that can be siphoned from each. Later that week the Finnish Angry Birds developer Rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations and called upon the wider industry to do the same.The documents revealed further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk. The NSA and GCHQ insist their activities comply with all relevant domestic and international laws although the Guardian stated the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information especially for those outside the US who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans. Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks codenamed Vault and dated from 2013 to 2016 detail the capabilities of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones including Android. ==== Security patches ==== In August 2015 Google announced that devices in the Google Nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches. Google also wrote that Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the Google Store. The following October researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7 of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support. Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that Android was originally designed above all else to be widely adopted. Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share so it was happy to give up control and give everyone seat at the table in exchange for adoption. ... Now though Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world 's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system period. As such security has become big issue. Android still uses software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update and it just does n't work. Following news of Google 's monthly schedule some manufacturers including Samsung and LG promised to issue monthly security updates but as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016 instead we got few updates on specific versions of small handful of models. And bunch of broken promises .In March 2017 post on Google 's Security Blog Android security leads Adrian Ludwig and Mel Miller wrote that More than 735 million devices from 200+ manufacturers received platform security update in 2016 and that Our carrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates releasing updates for over half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016. They also wrote that About half of devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received platform security update in the previous year stating that their work would continue to focus on streamlining the security updates program for easier deployment by manufacturers. Furthermore in comment to TechCrunch Ludwig stated that the wait time for security updates had been reduced from six to nine weeks down to just few days with 78 of flagship devices in North America being up-to-date on security at the end of 2016.Patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-priced devices. However the open-source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses. For example Samsung has worked with General Dynamics through their Open Kernel Labs acquisition to rebuild Jelly Bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the Knox project. Location-tracking Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points encountered as phone users move around to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones allowing them to run apps like Foursquare Google Latitude Facebook Places and to deliver location-based ads. Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid an academic research-funded project can in some cases detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers. Further notable exploits In 2018 Norwegian security firm Promon has unearthed serious Android security hole which can be exploited to steal login credentials access messages and track location which could be found in all versions of Android including Android 10. The vulnerability came by exploiting bug in the multitasking system enabling malicious app to overlay legitimate apps with fake login screens that users are not aware of when handing in security credentials. Users can also be tricked into granting additional permissions to the malicious apps which later enable them to perform various nefarious activities including intercepting texts or calls and stealing banking credentials. Avast Threat Labs also discovered that many pre-installed apps on several hundred new Android devices contain dangerous malware and adware. Some of the preinstalled malware can commit ad fraud or even take over its host device.In 2020 the Which. watchdog reported that more than billion Android devices released in 2012 or earlier which was 40 of Android devices worldwide were at risk of being hacked. This conclusion stemmed from the fact that no security updates were issued for the Android versions below 7.0 in 2019. Which. collaborated with the AV Comparatives anti-virus lab to infect five phone models with malware and it succeeded in each case. Google refused to comment on the watchdog 's speculations.On August 2020 Twitter published blog urging its users to update their applications to the latest version with regards to security concern that allowed others to access direct messages. hacker could easily use the Android system permissions to fetch the account credentials in order to do so. The security issue is only with Android Android Oreo and Android Android Pie. Twitter confirmed that updating the app will restrict such practices. Technical security features Android applications run in sandbox an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system 's resources unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed however this may not be possible for pre-installed apps. It is not possible for example to turn off the microphone access of the pre-installed camera app without disabling the camera completely. This is valid also in Android versions and 8.Since February 2012 Google has used its Google Bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan apps available in the Google Play store. Verify Apps feature was introduced in November 2012 as part of the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system version to scan all apps both from Google Play and from third-party sources for malicious behaviour. Originally only doing so during installation Verify Apps received an update in 2014 to constantly scan apps and in 2017 the feature was made visible to users through menu in Settings.Before installing an application the Google Play store displays list of the requirements an app needs to function. After reviewing these permissions the user can choose to accept or refuse them installing the application only if they accept. In Android 6.0 Marshmallow the permissions system was changed apps are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time. An opt-in system is used instead in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions to an app when they are needed for the first time. Applications remember the grants which can be revoked by the user at any time. Pre-installed apps however are not always part of this approach. In some cases it may not be possible to deny certain permissions to pre-installed apps nor be possible to disable them. The Google Play Services app can not be uninstalled nor disabled. Any force stop attempt result in the app restarting itself. The new permissions model is used only by applications developed for Marshmallow using its software development kit SDK and older apps will continue to use the previous all-or-nothing approach. Permissions can still be revoked for those apps though this might prevent them from working properly and warning is displayed to that effect.In September 2014 Jason Nova of Android Authority reported on study by the German security company Fraunhofer AISEC in antivirus software and malware threats on Android. Nova wrote that The Android operating system deals with software packages by sandboxing them this does not allow applications to list the directory contents of other apps to keep the system safe. By not allowing the antivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation applications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are cleared as safe. If then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out to be malicious the antivirus will have no way to know since it is inside the app and out of the antivirus jurisdiction. The study by Fraunhofer AISEC examining antivirus software from Avast AVG Bitdefender ESET F-Secure Kaspersky Lookout McAfee formerly Intel Security Norton Sophos and Trend Micro revealed that the tested antivirus apps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted attacks and that the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect malware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to hide its malignity .In August 2013 Google announced Android Device Manager renamed Find My Device in May 2017 service that allows users to remotely track locate and wipe their Android device with an Android app for the service released in December. In December 2016 Google introduced Trusted Contacts app letting users request location-tracking of loved ones during emergencies. In 2020 Trusted Contacts was shut down and the location-sharing feature rolled into Google Maps.On October 2018 Google announced new Google Play store requirements to combat over-sharing of potentially sensitive information including call and text logs. The issue stems from the fact that many apps request permissions to access users personal information even if this information is not needed for the app to function and some users unquestionably grant these permissions. Alternatively permission might be listed in the app manifest as required as opposed to optional and the app would not install unless user grants the permission users can withdraw any even required permissions from any app in the device settings after app installation but few users do this. Google promised to work with developers and create exceptions if their apps require Phone or SMS permissions for core app functionality. The new policies enforcement started on January 2019 90 days after policy announcement on October 2018. Furthermore Google announced new target API level requirement targetSdkVersion in manifest at least Android 8.0 API level 26 for all new apps and app updates. The API level requirement might combat the practice of app developers bypassing some permission screens by specifying early Android versions that had coarser permission model. ==== Verified Boot ==== The Android Open Source Project implements verified boot chain with intentions to verify that executed code such as the kernel or bootloader comes from an official source instead of malicious actor. This implementation establishes full chain of trust as it initially starts at hardware level. Subsequently the boot loader is verified and system partitions such as system and vendor are checked for integrity.Furthermore this process verifies that previous version of Android has not been installed. This effectively provides rollback protection which mitigates exploits that are similar to downgrade attack. ===== dm-verity ===== Android all supported versions as far back as version 4.4 of the Android Open Source Project has the option to provide verified boot chain with dm-verity. This is feature in the Linux kernel that allows for transparent integrity checking of block devices.This feature is designed to mitigate persistent rootkits. Google Play Services and vendor changes Dependence on proprietary Google Play Services and customizations added on top of the operating system by vendors who license Android from Google is causing privacy concerns. Licensing The source code for Android is open-source it is developed in private by Google with the source code released publicly when new version of Android is released. Google publishes most of the code including network and telephony stacks under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0. which allows modification and redistribution. The license does not grant rights to the Android trademark so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version developed by the Open Handset Alliance with the source code publicly available at all times. The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release. The reason according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom and they did not want third parties creating really bad user experience by attempting to put onto smartphones version of Android intended for tablets.Only the base Android operating system including some applications is open-source software whereas most Android devices ship with substantial amount of proprietary software such as Google Mobile Services which includes applications such as Google Play Store Google Search and Google Play Services software layer that provides APIs for the integration with Google-provided services among others. These applications must be licensed from Google by device makers and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements. Custom certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers such as Samsung Experience may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system. With the advent of the Google Pixel line of devices Google itself has also made specific Android features timed or permanent exclusives to the Pixel series. There may also be binary blob drivers required for certain hardware components in the device. The best known fully open source Android services are the LineageOS distribution and MicroG which acts as an open source replacement of Google Play Services. Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or uninstall applications and as result invite non-free software. In both cases the use of closed-source software causes the system to become vulnerable to backdoors.It has been argued that because developers are often required to purchase the Google-branded Android license this has turned the theoretically open system into freemium service. 20 Leverage over manufacturers Google licenses their Google Mobile Services software along with the Android trademarks only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google 's compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document. Thus forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google 's non-free components stay incompatible with applications that require them and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store. prominent example of such an Android fork is Amazon 's Fire OS which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets and oriented toward Amazon services. The shipment of Android devices without GMS is also common in mainland China as Google does not do business there.In 2014 Google also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google Mobile Services software display prominent Powered by Android logo on their boot screens. Google has also enforced preferential bundling and placement of Google Mobile Services on devices including mandated bundling of the entire main suite of Google applications mandatory placement of shortcuts to Google Search and the Play Store app on or near the main home screen page in its default configuration and granting larger share of search revenue to OEMs who agree to not include third-party app stores on their devices. In March 2018 it was reported that Google had begun to block uncertified Android devices from using Google Mobile Services software and display warning indicating that the device manufacturer has preloaded Google apps and services without certification from Google. Users of custom ROMs can register their device ID to their Google account to remove this block.Some stock applications and components in AOSP code that were formerly used by earlier versions of Android such as Search Music Calendar and the location API were abandoned by Google in favor of non-free replacements distributed through Play Store Google Search Google Play Music and Google Calendar and Google Play Services which are no longer open-source. Moreover open-source variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their non-free versions. These measures are likely intended to discourage forks and encourage commercial licensing in line with Google requirements as the majority of the operating system 's core functionality is dependent on proprietary components licensed exclusively by Google and it would take significant development resources to develop an alternative suite of software and APIs to replicate or replace them. Apps that do not use Google components would also be at functional disadvantage as they can only use APIs contained within the OS itself. In turn third-party apps may have dependencies on Google Play Services.Members of the Open Handset Alliance which include the majority of Android OEMs are also contractually forbidden from producing Android devices based on forks of the OS in 2012 Acer Inc. was forced by Google to halt production on device powered by Alibaba Group 's Aliyun OS with threats of removal from the OHA as Google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of Android. Alibaba Group defended the allegations arguing that the OS was distinct platform from Android primarily using HTML5 apps but incorporated portions of Android 's platform to allow backwards compatibility with third-party Android software. Indeed the devices did ship with an application store which offered Android apps however the majority of them were pirated. Reception Android received lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007. Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android. The idea of an open-source Linux-based development platform sparked interest but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market such as Nokia and Microsoft and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development. These established players were skeptical Nokia was quoted as saying we do n't see this as threat and member of Microsoft 's Windows Mobile team stated do n't understand the impact that they are going to have. Since then Android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system and one of the fastest mobile experiences available. Reviewers have highlighted the open-source nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths allowing companies such as Nokia Nokia family Amazon Kindle Fire Barnes Noble Nook Ouya Baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of Android. As result it has been described by technology website Ars Technica as practically the default operating system for launching new hardware for companies without their own mobile platforms. This openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user Android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from non-Google app stores and third party websites. These have been cited as among the main advantages of Android phones over others.Despite Android 's popularity including an activation rate three times that of iOS there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected. The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services Amazon 's Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google 's proprietary components and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstore instead of Play Store. In 2014 in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen.Android has suffered from fragmentation situation where the variety of Android devices in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS where hardware and software varies less. For example according to data from OpenSignal in July 2013 there were 11,868 models of Android devices numerous screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS. Critics such as Apple Insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed Android 's growth through large volumes of low end budget-priced devices running older versions of Android. They maintain this forces Android developers to write for the lowest common denominator to reach as many users as possible who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on smaller percentage of devices. However OpenSignal who develops both Android and iOS apps concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier Android 's wider global reach also increases the potential reward. Market share Android is the most used operating system on phones in virtually all countries with some countries such as India having over 96 market share. On tablets usage is more even as iOS is bit more popular globally. Research company Canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009 that Android had 2.8 share of worldwide smartphone shipments. By May 2010 Android had 10 worldwide smartphone market share overtaking Windows Mobile whilst in the US Android held 28 share overtaking iPhone OS. By the fourth quarter of 2010 its worldwide share had grown to 33 of the market becoming the top-selling smartphone platform overtaking Symbian. In the US it became the top-selling platform in April 2011 overtaking BlackBerry OS with 31.2 smartphone share according to comScore.By the third quarter of 2011 Gartner estimated that more than half 52.5 of the smartphone sales belonged to Android. By the third quarter of 2012 Android had 75 share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm IDC.In July 2011 Google said that 550,000 Android devices were being activated every day up from 400,000 per day in May and more than 100 million devices had been activated with 4.4 growth per week. In September 2012 500 million devices had been activated with 1.3 million activations per day. In May 2013 at Google I/O Sundar Pichai announced that 900 million Android devices had been activated.Android market share varies by location. In July 2012 mobile subscribers aged 13+ in the United States using Android were up to 52 and rose to 90 in China. During the third quarter of 2012 Android 's worldwide smartphone shipment market share was 75 with 750 million devices activated in total. In April 2013 Android had 1.5 million activations per day. As of May 2013 48 billion application app installation have been performed from the Google Play store and by September 2013 one billion Android devices had been activated.As of August 2020 the Google Play store had over million Android applications published and as of May 2016 apps had been downloaded more than 65 billion times. The operating system 's success has made it target for patent litigation as part of the so-called smartphone wars between technology companies.Android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets including the US while only in Japan was Apple on top September–November 2013 numbers. At the end of 2013 over 1.5 billion Android smartphones had been sold in the four years since 2010 making Android the most sold phone and tablet OS. Three billion Android smartphones were estimated to be sold by the end of 2014 including previous years. According to Gartner research company Android-based devices outsold all contenders every year since 2012. In 2013 it outsold Windows 2.8:1 or by 573 million. As of 2015 Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems Since 2013 devices running it also sell more than Windows iOS and Mac OS devices combined.According to StatCounter which tracks only the use for browsing the web Android is the most popular mobile operating system since August 2013. Android is the most popular operating system for web browsing in India and several other countries e.g. virtually all of Asia with Japan and North Korea exceptions. According to StatCounter Android is most used on mobile in all African countries and it stated mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including India South Africa and Saudi Arabia with virtually all countries in Africa having done so already except for seven countries including Egypt such as Ethiopia and Kenya in which mobile including tablets usage is at 90.46 Android only accounts for 75.81 of all use there .While Android phones in the Western world almost always include Google 's proprietary code such as Google Play in the otherwise open-source operating system Google 's proprietary code and trademark is increasingly not used in emerging markets The growth of AOSP Android devices goes way beyond just China .. ABI Research claims that 65 million devices shipped globally with open-source Android in the second quarter of 2014 up from 54 million in the first quarter depending on country percent of phones estimated to be based only on AOSP source code forgoing the Android trademark Thailand 44 Philippines 38 Indonesia 31 India 21 Malaysia 24 Mexico 18 Brazil .According to January 2015 Gartner report Android surpassed billion shipments of devices in 2014 and will continue to grow at double-digit pace in 2015 with 26 percent increase year over year. This made it the first time that any general-purpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within year by reaching close to 1.16 billion end users in 2014 Android shipped over four times more than iOS and OS combined and over three times more than Microsoft Windows. Gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to reach two billion units in 2016 including Android. Describing the statistics Farhad Manjoo wrote in The New York Times that About one of every two computers sold today is running Android. It has become Earth 's dominant computing platform. According to Statistica 's estimate Android smartphones had an installed base of 1.8 billion units in 2015 which was 76 of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide. Android has the largest installed base of any mobile operating system and since 2013 the highest-selling operating system overall with sales in 2012 2013 and 2014 close to the installed base of all PCs.In the second quarter of 2014 Android 's share of the global smartphone shipment market was 84.7 new record. This had grown to 87.5 worldwide market share by the third quarter of 2016 leaving main competitor iOS with 12.1 market share.According to an April 2017 StatCounter report Android overtook Microsoft Windows to become the most popular operating system for total Internet usage. It has maintained the plurality since then.In September 2015 Google announced that Android had 1.4 billion monthly active users. This changed to billion monthly active users in May 2017. Adoption on tablets Despite its success on smartphones initially Android tablet adoption was slow then later caught up with the iPad in most countries. One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to lack of high quality tablet applications but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was significant market for them. The content and app ecosystem proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets. Due to the lack of Android tablet-specific applications in 2011 early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill-suited to larger screen sizes whereas the dominance of Apple 's iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet-specific iOS applications.Despite app support in its infancy considerable number of Android tablets like the Barnes Noble Nook alongside those using other operating systems such as the HP TouchPad and BlackBerry PlayBook were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad. InfoWorld has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as Frankenphone business short-term low-investment opportunity by placing smartphone-optimized Android OS before Android 3.0 Honeycomb for tablets was available on device while neglecting user interface. This approach such as with the Dell Streak failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of Android tablets. Furthermore several Android tablets such as the Motorola Xoom were priced the same or higher than the iPad which hurt sales. An exception was the Amazon Kindle Fire which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon 's ecosystem of applications and content.This began to change in 2012 with the release of the affordable Nexus and push by Google for developers to write better tablet applications. According to International Data Corporation shipments of Android-powered tablets surpassed iPads in Q3 2012. As of the end of 2013 over 191.6 million Android tablets had sold in three years since 2011. This made Android tablets the most-sold type of tablet in 2013 surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013.According to StatCounter 's web use statistics as of 2020 Android tablets represent the majority of tablet devices used in Africa 70 South America 65 while less than half elsewhere e.g. Europe 44 Asia 44 North America 34 and Oceania/Australia 18. There are countries on all continents where Android tablets are the majority for example Mexico.In March 2016 Galen Gruman of InfoWorld stated that Android devices could be real part of your business .. there 's no longer reason to keep Android at arm 's length. It can now be as integral to your mobile portfolio as Apple 's iOS devices are. year earlier Gruman had stated that Microsoft 's own mobile Office apps were better on iOS and Android than on Microsoft 's own Windows 10 devices. Platform information The recently released Android 12 is the most popular Android version on both smartphones and tablets and with next most popular Android 11 at 51 combined share and at 70 for all supported version. As of January 2023 Android 12 is most popular on smartphones at 28 followed by Android 11. Android 13 the most recent version is 4th most popular at over 10. Usage of Android 10 and newer i.e. supported versions is at 78 the rest of users are not supported with security updates. Android 13 is most popular in Canada and in some Nordic countries.On tablets Android 12 is most popular at 19 followed by Android 11. Usage of Android 10 and newer i.e. supported versions is at 43 on Android tablets with Pie 9.O until recently supported at 61. The usage share varies lot by country e.g. Android 9.0 Pie is the version with the greatest usage share in the United States also in the UK at 36 while Android 11 is also very popular e.g. most used in Australia Russia and Oreo 8.1 most used in China. As of July 2021 66 of devices have Vulkan support 47 on newer Vulkan 1.1 the successor to OpenGL. At the same time 91.5 of the devices have support for OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher in addition the rest of devices 8.50 use version 2.0 with 73.50 using the latest version OpenGL ES 3.2. Application piracy In general paid Android applications can easily be pirated. In May 2012 interview with Eurogamer the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld. However not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue for example in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12 and most of the piracy came from China where people can not purchase apps from Google Play.In 2010 Google released tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack. Google responded that the tool especially its initial release was intended as sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs not as finished piracy solution. Android Jelly Bean introduced the ability for paid applications to be encrypted so that they may work only on the device for which they were purchased. Legal issues The success of Android has made it target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies both Android and Android phone manufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits and other legal challenges. Patent lawsuit with Oracle On August 12 2010 Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language. Oracle originally sought damages up to 6.1 billion but this valuation was rejected by United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate. In response Google submitted multiple lines of defense counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle 's patents or copyright that Oracle 's patents were invalid and several other defenses. They said that Android 's Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony clean room implementation of the Java class libraries and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik. In May 2012 the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle 's patents and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for small amount of copied code. On May 2014 the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling ruling in Oracle 's favor on the copyrightability issue and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court.In December 2015 Google announced that the next major release of Android Android Nougat would switch to OpenJDK which is the official open-source implementation of the Java platform instead of using the now-discontinued Apache Harmony project as its runtime. Code reflecting this change was also posted to the AOSP source repository. In its announcement Google claimed this was part of an effort to create common code base between Java on Android and other platforms. Google later admitted in court filing that this was part of an effort to address the disputes with Oracle as its use of OpenJDK code is governed under the GNU General Public License GPL with linking exception and that any damages claim associated with the new versions expressly licensed by Oracle under OpenJDK would require separate analysis of damages from earlier releases. In June 2016 United States federal court ruled in favor of Google stating that its use of the APIs was fair use.In April 2021 the United Supreme Court ruled that Google 's use of the Java APIs was within the bounds of fair use reversing the Federal Circuit Appeals Court ruling and remanding the case for further hearing. The majority opinion began with the assumption that the APIs may be copyrightable and thus proceeded with review of the factors that contributed to fair use. Anti-competitive challenges in Europe In 2013 FairSearch lobbying organization supported by Microsoft Oracle and others filed complaint regarding Android with the European Commission alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive predatory pricing. The Free Software Foundation Europe whose donors include Google disputed the Fairsearch allegations. On April 20 2016 the EU filed formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations arguing that its leverage over Android vendors including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android constituted anti-competitive practices. In August 2016 Google was fined US 6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service FAS under similar allegations by Yandex. The European Commission issued its decision on July 18 2018 determining that Google had conducted three operations related to Android that were in violation of antitrust regulations bundling Google 's search and Chrome as part of Android blocking phone manufacturers from using forked versions of Android and establishing deals with phone manufacturers and network providers to exclusively bundle the Google search application on handsets practice Google ended by 2014. The EU fined Google for €4.3 billion about US billion and required the company to end this conduct within 90 days. Google filed its appeal of the ruling in October 2018 though will not ask for any interim measures to delay the onset of conduct requirements.On October 16 2018 Google announced that it would change its distribution model for Google Mobile Services in the EU since part of its revenues streams for Android which came through use of Google Search and Chrome were now prohibited by the EU 's ruling. While the core Android system remains free OEMs in Europe would be required to purchase paid license to the core suite of Google applications such as Gmail Google Maps and the Google Play Store. Google Search will be licensed separately with an option to include Google Chrome at no additional cost atop Search. European OEMs can bundle third-party alternatives on phones and devices sold to customers if they so choose. OEMs will no longer be barred from selling any device running incompatible versions of Android in Europe. Others In addition to lawsuits against Google directly various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market. Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement with Apple 's ongoing legal action against Samsung being particularly high-profile case. In January 2012 Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers whose products account for 70 percent of all Android smartphones sold in the US and 55 of the worldwide revenue for Android devices. These include Samsung and HTC. Samsung 's patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft 's Windows Phone operating system. Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees while at the same time helping to promote its software lines.Google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the United States accusing Apple Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation rather than innovating and competing with better products and services. In August 2011 Google purchased Motorola Mobility for US 12.5 billion which was viewed in part as defensive measure to protect Android since Motorola Mobility held more than 17,000 patents. In December 2011 Google bought over thousand patents from IBM.Turkey 's competition authority investigations about default search engine in Android started in 2017 led to US 17.4 million fine in September 2018 and fine of 0.05 percent of Google 's revenue per day in November 2019 when Google did n't meet the requirements. In December 2019 Google stopped issuing licenses for new Android phone models sold in Turkey. Other uses Google has developed several variations of Android for specific use cases including Android Wear later renamed Wear OS for wearable devices such as wrist watches Android TV for televisions Android Things for smart or Internet of things devices and Android Automotive for cars. Additionally by providing infrastructure that combines dedicated hardware and dedicated applications running on regular Android Google have opened up the platform for its use in particular usage scenarios such as the Android Auto app for cars and Daydream Virtual Reality platform.The open and customizable nature of Android allows device makers to use it on other electronics as well including laptops netbooks and desktop computers cameras headphones home automation systems game consoles media players satellites routers printers payment terminals automated teller machines and robots. Additionally Android has been installed and run on variety of less-technical objects including calculators single-board computers feature phones electronic dictionaries alarm clocks refrigerators landline telephones coffee machines bicycles and mirrors.Ouya video game console running Android became one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns crowdfunding US 8.5m for its development and was later followed by other Android-based consoles such as Nvidia 's Shield Portable an Android device in video game controller form factor.In 2011 Google demonstrated Android Home home automation technology which uses Android to control range of household devices including light switches power sockets and thermostats. Prototype light bulbs were announced that could be controlled from an Android phone or tablet but Android head Andy Rubin was cautious to note that turning lightbulb on and off is nothing new pointing to numerous failed home automation services. Google he said was thinking more ambitiously and the intention was to use their position as cloud services provider to bring Google products into customers homes. Parrot unveiled an Android-based car stereo system known as Asteroid in 2011 followed by successor the touchscreen-based Asteroid Smart in 2012. In 2013 Clarion released its own Android-based car stereo the AX1. In January 2014 at the Consumer Electronics Show CES Google announced the formation of the Open Automotive Alliance group including several major automobile makers Audi General Motors Hyundai and Honda and Nvidia which aims to produce Android-based in-car entertainment systems for automobiles bringing the best of Android into the automobile in safe and seamless way. Android comes preinstalled on few laptops similar functionality of running Android applications is also available in Google 's ChromeOS and can also be installed on personal computers by end users. On those platforms Android provides additional functionality for physical keyboards and mice together with the Alt-Tab key combination for switching applications quickly with keyboard. In December 2014 one reviewer commented that Android 's notification system is vastly more complete and robust than in most environments and that Android is absolutely usable as one 's primary desktop operating system.In October 2015 The Wall Street Journal reported that Android will serve as Google 's future main laptop operating system with the plan to fold ChromeOS into it by 2017. Google 's Sundar Pichai who led the development of Android explained that mobile as computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today. Also back in 2009 Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself said that ChromeOS and Android would likely converge over time. Lockheimer who replaced Pichai as head of Android and ChromeOS responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that While we 've been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems there 's no plan to phase out ChromeOS which has guaranteed auto-updates for five years. That is unlike Android where support is shorter with EOL dates being .. at least years into the future for Android tablets for education .At Google I/O in May 2016 Google announced Daydream virtual reality platform that relies on smartphone and provides VR capabilities through virtual reality headset and controller designed by Google itself. The platform is built into Android starting with Android Nougat differentiating from standalone support for VR capabilities. The software is available for developers and was released in 2016. Mascot The mascot of Android is green android robot as related to the software 's name. Although it has no official name the Android team at Google reportedly call it Bugdroid .It was designed by then-Google graphic designer Irina Blok on November 2007 when Android was announced. Contrary to reports that she was tasked with project to create an icon Blok confirmed in an interview that she independently developed it and made it open source. The robot design was initially not presented to Google but it quickly became commonplace in the Android development team with various variations of it created by the developers there who liked the figure as it was free under Creative Commons license. Its popularity amongst the development team eventually led to Google adopting it as an official icon as part of the Android logo when it launched to consumers in 2008.

Alibi,An alibi from the Latin alibī meaning somewhere else is statement by person who is possible perpetrator of crime of where they were at the time particular offence was committed which is somewhere other than where the crime took place. During police investigation all possible suspects are usually asked to provide details of their whereabouts during the relevant time period which where possible would usually be confirmed by other persons or in other ways such as by checking phone records or credit card receipts use of CCTV etc. During criminal trial an alibi is defence raised by the accused as proof that they could not have committed the crime because they were in some other place at the time the alleged offence was committed. The Criminal Law Deskbook of Criminal Procedure states Alibi is different from all of the other defences it is based upon the premise that the defendant is truly innocent.,An alibi from the Latin alibī meaning somewhere else is statement by person who is possible perpetrator of crime of where they were at the time particular offence was committed which is somewhere other than where the crime took place.

The Criminal Law Deskbook of Criminal Procedure states Alibi is different from all of the other defences it is based upon the premise that the defendant is truly innocent. Duty to disclose In some legal jurisdictions there may be requirement that the accused disclose an alibi defence prior to the trial. This is to enable the investigators to verify whether or not such claim is true. This is an exception to the rule that criminal defendant can not normally be compelled to furnish information to the prosecution. Since the alibi involves evidence of innocence rather than guilt the privilege against self-incrimination is not implicated.In Canada the defence must disclose an alibi defence with sufficient time for the authorities to investigate the alibi and with sufficient particularization to allow for meaningful investigation. Failure to comply with the two requirements will result in the court making an adverse inference against the alibi defence but will not result in the exclusion of the alibi defence .Conversely some judges in other jurisdictions have held the opinion that the mandatory early disclosure of alibis is unfair possibly even unconstitutional. False alibi The giving of false alibi beside resulting in possible subsequent criminal offences obstruction of justice perjury etc. may in some jurisdictions result in negative ramifications for the trial itself. In Canada the giving of false alibi may be used by the court as actual evidence of guilt provided certain requirements are met. Specifically The alibi must not be believed There is evidence of an intention to fabricate the alibi that is independent from the evidence used to show the alibi is false and The court must reject all innocent explanations offered that would explain why false alibi was fabricated. Alibi agency An alibi agency also called an alibi network forges explanations for unexcused absences e.g. due to an extramarital affair or adultery. In other words alibi agencies are paid to lie for their customers. Originating in 1990s Japan such services appeared in Europe in 2004 where they were condemned as immoral by the Catholic Church in Germany. They are the subject of the 2006 movie The Alibi.

Bruce Springsteen,Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen born September 23 1949 is an American singer songwriter and musician. He has released 21 studio albums during career spanning six decades most of which feature his backing band the Street Band. He is an originator of heartland rock genre combining mainstream rock music with poetic and socially conscious lyrics that tell narrative about working-class American life. Nicknamed The Boss he is known for his lyrics and energetic concerts with performances that can last more than four hours.Springsteen released his first two albums Greetings from Asbury Park N.J. and The Wild the Innocent the Street Shuffle in 1973 neither earned him large audience. He then changed his style and achieved worldwide popularity with Born to Run 1975. This was followed by Darkness on the Edge of Town 1978 and The River 1980 which topped the Billboard 200 chart. After the solo album Nebraska 1982 he reunited with his Street Band for Born in the U.S.A. 1984 which became his most commercially successful album and one of the best-selling albums of all time. Seven of its singles reached the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100 including the title track.

He ranked 23rd on Rolling Stone 's list of the Greatest Artists of All Time which described him as being the embodiment of rock roll. Early life Bruce Frederick Joseph Springsteen was born at Monmouth Medical Center in Long Branch New Jersey on September 23 1949. He is of Dutch Irish and Italian descent. He grew up Catholic in Freehold New Jersey. His mother Adele Ann née Zerilli born 1925 was originally from the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn New York. She worked as legal secretary and was the main breadwinner in the family. His father Douglas Frederick Dutch Springsteen 1924–1998 worked various jobs such as bus driver. His father had mental health issues throughout his life which worsened in his later years. Springsteen has two younger sisters named Virginia and Pamela born c. 1962. The latter had brief acting career but left to pursue photography and later took photos for his albums Human Touch Lucky Town and The Ghost of Tom Joad.Springsteen 's Italian maternal grandfather was born in Vico Equense and emigrated through Ellis Island. He could not read or write when he arrived. He eventually became lawyer and impressed the young Springsteen as being larger than life. The Springsteen surname originates in the Dutch province of Groningen and is topographic literally translating to jump stone and meaning stepping stone used on unpaved streets or between two houses. The Springsteens were among the early Dutch families who settled in the colony of New Netherland in the 1600s.Springsteen attended the St. Rose of Lima Catholic school in Freehold where he was at odds with the nuns and rebelled against the strictures imposed upon him though some of his later music reflected Catholic ethos and included Irish-Catholic hymns with rock music twist. In 2012 interview he explained that it was his Catholic upbringing rather than his political ideology that most influenced his music. He said his faith had given him very active spiritual life but joked that this made it very difficult sexually and added once Catholic always Catholic. He grew up hearing fellow New Jersey singer Frank Sinatra on the radio and became interested in being musician at the age of seven when he saw Elvis Presley 's performances on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1956 and 1957. Soon after his mother rented him guitar from Mike Diehl 's Music in Freehold for week but it failed to provide him with the instant gratification he desired.In ninth grade Springsteen began attending the public Freehold High School but did not fit in there either. former teacher said he was loner who wanted nothing more than to play his guitar. He graduated in 1967 but felt so alienated that he skipped his graduation ceremony. He briefly attended Ocean County College but dropped out. Upon being drafted when he was 19 Springsteen failed the physical examination and avoided service in the Vietnam War because the concussion he had suffered in motorcycle accident two years prior and his behavior at induction reportedly made him unacceptable for service. In 1969 when he was 20 years old Springsteen 's parents and sister Pamela moved to San Mateo California he and his sister Virginia who was married and pregnant stayed in Freehold. Career 1964–1972 Early career In 1964 Springsteen saw the Beatles televised appearances on The Ed Sullivan Show. Inspired he bought his first guitar for 18.95 at the Western Auto appliance store. Thereafter he started playing for audiences with band called the Rogues at local venues including Elks Lodge in Freehold. Later that year his mother took out loan to buy him 60 Kent guitar an act he later memorialized in his song The Wish. In 1965 he went to the house of Tex and Marion Vinyard who sponsored young bands in town. They helped him become the lead guitarist and subsequently one of the lead singers of the Castiles. The band recorded two original songs at public recording studio in Brick Township and played variety of venues including Cafe Wha. in Greenwich Village Marion Vinyard said that she believed the young Springsteen when he promised he would make it big. In the late 1960s Springsteen performed briefly in power trio known as Earth playing in clubs in New Jersey with one major show at the Hotel Diplomat in New York City.From 1969 through early 1971 Springsteen performed with the band Child which later changed its name to Spider Man and included Danny Federici Vini Lopez Vinnie Roslin and later Steve Van Zandt and Robbin Thompson. During this time they performed regularly at venues on the Jersey Shore especially The Stone Pony. They also played in Richmond Virginia Nashville Tennessee and California quickly gathering cult following. San Francisco Examiner review of their show at The Matrix by music critic Philip Elwood gave Springsteen early credibility. In his glowing assessment of Steel Mill Elwood wrote that he had never been so overwhelmed by totally unknown talent and called the band the first big thing that 's happened to Asbury Park since the good ship Morro Castle burned to the waterline of that Jersey beach in '34. Elwood went on to praise the band 's cohesive musicality and in particular singled out Springsteen as most impressive composer. In San Mateo Steel Mill recorded three original Springsteen songs at Pacific Recording.As Springsteen sought to shape unique and genuine musical and lyrical style he performed with the bands Dr. Zoom the Sonic Boom from early-to-mid-1971 the Sundance Blues Band in mid-1971 and the Bruce Springsteen Band from mid-1971 to mid-1972. His prolific songwriting ability included as his future record label would describe it in early publicity campaigns more words in some individual songs than other artists had in whole albums. He brought his skills to the attention of several people who went on to prove influential to his career development including new managers Mike Appel and Jim Cretecos who in turn brought him to the attention of Columbia Records talent scout John Hammond. Hammond auditioned Springsteen in May 1972.In October 1972 Springsteen formed new band for the recording of his debut album Greetings from Asbury Park N.J. The band eventually became known as the Street Band although the name was not used until September 1974. Springsteen acquired the nickname the Boss during this period since he took on the task of collecting his band 's nightly pay and distributing it amongst his bandmates. The nickname also reportedly sprang from games of Monopoly that Springsteen would play with other Jersey Shore musicians. 1972–1974 Initial struggle Springsteen was signed to Columbia Records in 1972 by Clive Davis after having piqued the interest of John Hammond who had signed Bob Dylan to the same label decade earlier. Despite the expectations of Columbia Records executives that Springsteen would record an acoustic album he brought many of his New Jersey-based colleagues into the studio with him and formed the Street Band although the band would not be formally named for several months. His debut album Greetings from Asbury Park N.J. released in January 1973 established him as critical favorite though sales were slow. Because of Springsteen 's lyrical poeticism and folk rock-rooted music exemplified on tracks like Blinded by the Light and For You as well as the Columbia and Hammond connections critics initially compared Springsteen to Dylan. He sings with freshness and urgency have n't heard since was rocked by 'Like Rolling Stone wrote Crawdaddy magazine editor Peter Knobler in Springsteen 's first interview/profile in March 1973. Photographs for that original profile were taken by Ed Gallucci. Crawdaddy discovered Springsteen in the rock press and was his earliest champion. Knobler profiled him in Crawdaddy three times in 1973 1975 and 1978. Springsteen and the Street Band acknowledged the magazine 's support by giving private performance at the Crawdaddy 10th Anniversary Party in New York City in June 1976. Music critic Lester Bangs wrote in Creem in 1975 that when Springsteen 's first album was released ... many of us dismissed it he wrote like Bob Dylan and Van Morrison sang like Van Morrison and Robbie Robertson and led band that sounded like Van Morrison 's .In September 1973 Springsteen 's second album The Wild the Innocent the Street Shuffle was released. Like Greetings from Asbury Park it was met with critical acclaim but limited commercial success. Springsteen 's songs became grander in form and scope with the Street Band providing less folksy more rhythm and blues vibe and the lyrics often romanticized teenage street life. 4th of July Asbury Park Sandy and Incident on 57th Street became fan favorites and the long rousing Rosalita Come Out Tonight continues to rank among Springsteen 's most beloved concert numbers. Rosalita is the ninth most played song in his catalog as of June 2020 it has been played by Springsteen 809 times.After seeing Springsteen 's performance at the Harvard Square Theater music critic Jon Landau wrote in the May 22 1974 issue of Boston 's The Real Paper saw rock and roll future and its name is Bruce Springsteen. And on night when needed to feel young he made me feel like was hearing music for the very first time. Landau helped to finish the epic new album Born to Run and subsequently became Springsteen 's manager and producer. Given an enormous budget in last-ditch effort at commercially viable record Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for Wall of Sound production. But when his manager Mike Appel orchestrated the release of an early mix of Born to Run to nearly dozen radio stations anticipation built toward the album 's release.The album took more than 14 months to record with six months alone spent on developing the song Born to Run. During this time Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album saying he heard sounds in his head that he could not explain to the others in the studio. It was during recording session of Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out on July 13 1975 that Steve Van Zandt was asked by Springsteen and Jon Landau to take charge and instruct the horn players. They both knew he was playing guitar and managing Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes who had the sound they were seeking. Van Zandt sang each horn player his part with the lines the timing and the inflection all perfect. The musicians played their parts and the horns were recorded. When they finished Springsteen turned to Mike Appel and said Okay. It 's time to put the boy on the payroll. 've been meaning to tell you he 's the new guitar player. Van Zandt joined the Street Band week later on July 20 the opening night of the Born to Run tour. He also helped Springsteen perfect Born to Run by adding its memorable guitar line. In the 2005 documentary Wings for Wheels Springsteen called his friend 's input on the track 's main riff arguably Steve 's greatest contribution to my music. The album was completed on July 25. But at the end of the grueling recording sessions Springsteen was still unsatisfied. Upon first hearing the finished album he threw it into the alley another master was so bad that Springsteen flung it out of his hotel room window and into river. He was going to scrap half of it he told Appel and substitute live recordings for upcoming show dates at The Bottom Line in New York City venue where he often played. 1975–1983 Born to Run and breakthrough success On August 13 1975 Springsteen and the Street Band began five-night 10-show stand at New York 's The Bottom Line club. The 10-show stand attracted media attention and was broadcast live on WNEW-FM. Decades later Rolling Stone magazine named the stand one of the 50 Moments That Changed Rock and Roll .Born to Run was released on August 25 1975. It proved to be breakthrough album that catapulted Springsteen to worldwide fame. The album peaked at No. on the Billboard 200 and while reception at US top 40 radio outlets for the album 's two singles was not overwhelming Born to Run reached modest No. 23 on the Billboard charts and Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out peaked at No. 83 almost every track on the album received album-oriented rock airplay especially Born to Run Thunder Road Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out and Jungleland all of which remain perennial favorites on many classic rock stations. In October 1975 Springsteen appeared on the covers of both Newsweek and Time in the same week. So great did the wave of publicity become that he eventually rebelled against it during his first venture overseas tearing down promotional posters before concert appearance in London.A legal battle with former manager Mike Appel kept Springsteen out of the studio for nearly year during which time he kept the Street Band together through extensive touring across the U.S. Despite the optimistic fervor with which he often performed Springsteen 's new songs sounded more somber than much of his previous work. Reaching settlement with Appel in 1977 Springsteen returned to the studio and the subsequent sessions produced Darkness on the Edge of Town 1978. Musically this album was turning point in Springsteen 's career. Gone were the raw rapid-fire lyrics outsized characters and long multi-part musical compositions of the first three albums the songs were leaner and more carefully drawn and began to reflect Springsteen 's growing intellectual and political awareness. The cross-country 1978 tour to promote the album would become legendary for the intensity and length of its shows.By the late 1970s Springsteen earned reputation as songwriter whose material could provide hits for other bands. Manfred Mann 's Earth Band had achieved U.S. No. pop hit with heavily rearranged version of Greetings Blinded by the Light in early 1977. Patti Smith reached No. 13 with her version of Springsteen 's unreleased Because the Night with revised lyrics by Smith in 1978. The Pointer Sisters hit No. in 1979 with Springsteen 's then unreleased Fire. Between 1976 and 1978 Springsteen provided four compositions to Southside Johnny the Asbury Jukes including The Fever and Hearts of Stone and collaborated on four more with Steven Van Zandt producer of their first three albums.In September 1979 Springsteen and the Street Band joined the Musicians United for Safe Energy anti-nuclear power collective at Madison Square Garden for two nights playing an abbreviated set while premiering two songs from his upcoming album. The subsequent No Nukes live album as well as the following summer 's No Nukes documentary film represented the first official recordings and footage of Springsteen 's fabled live act and Springsteen 's first tentative dip into political involvement.Springsteen continued to focus on working class life with the 20-song double album The River in 1980 which included an intentionally paradoxical range of material from good time party rockers to emotionally intense ballads and finally yielded his first hit top ten single as performer Hungry Heart. The album sold well becoming his first No. on the Billboard Pop Albums chart.The River was released in 1982 followed by the stark solo acoustic Nebraska. According to the Dave Marsh 's biographies Springsteen was depressed when he wrote this material resulting in brutal depiction of American life. While Nebraska did not sell as well as Springsteen 's three previous albums it garnered widespread critical praise including being named Album of the Year by Rolling Stone magazine 's critics and influenced later works by other major artists. 1984–1986 Born in the U.S.A. and cultural phenomenon Springsteen is probably best known for his album Born in the U.S.A. 1984 which sold 15 million copies in the U.S. 30 million worldwide and became one of the best-selling albums of all time with seven singles hitting the Top 10. The title track was bitter commentary on the treatment of Vietnam veterans some of whom were Springsteen 's friends. The lyrics in the verses were entirely unambiguous when listened to but the anthemic music and the title of the song made it hard for many from politicians to the common person to get the lyrics—except those in the chorus which could be read many ways. The song made huge political impact as he was advocating for the rights of the common working-class man.The song was widely misinterpreted as jingoistic and in connection with the 1984 presidential campaign became the subject of considerable folklore. In 1984 conservative columnist George Will attended Springsteen concert and then wrote column praising Springsteen 's work ethic. Six days after the column was printed in campaign rally in Hammonton New Jersey President Ronald Reagan said America 's future rests in thousand dreams inside your hearts. It rests in the message of hope in the songs of man so many young Americans admire—New Jersey 's own Bruce Springsteen. Two nights later at concert in Pittsburgh Springsteen told the crowd Well the president was mentioning my name in his speech the other day and kind of got to wondering what his favorite album of mine must 've been you know. do n't think it was the Nebraska album. do n't think he 's been listening to this one. He then began playing Johnny 99 with its allusions to closing factories and criminals. Dancing in the Dark was the biggest of seven hit singles from Born in the U.S.A. peaking at No. on the Billboard singles chart. The video for the song showed young Courteney Cox dancing on stage with Springsteen which helped start the actress 's career. The song Cover Me was written by Springsteen for Donna Summer but his record company persuaded him to keep it for the new album. big fan of Summer 's work Springsteen wrote another song for her Protection. Videos for the album were directed by Brian De Palma and John Sayles. Springsteen played on the We Are the World song and album in 1985. His live track Trapped from that album received moderate airplay on US Top 40 stations as well as reaching No. on the Billboard Top Rock Tracks chart. The Born in the U.S.A. period represented the height of Springsteen 's visibility in popular culture and the broadest audience he would ever reach aided by the release of Arthur Baker 's dance mixes of three of the singles. From June 15 to August 10 1985 all seven of his albums appeared on the UK Albums Chart the first time an artist had charted their entire back catalogue simultaneously.Live/1975–85 five-record box set also on three cassettes or three CDs was released near the end of 1986 and became the first box set to debut at No. on the U.S. album charts. It is one of the most commercially successful live albums of all time ultimately selling 13 million units in the U.S. During the 1980s several Springsteen fanzines were launched including Backstreets magazine. 1987–1991 Tunnel of Love and activism Springsteen released the much more sedate and contemplative Tunnel of Love album in 1987. The album is mature reflection on the many faces of love found lost and squandered which only selectively used the Street Band. On July 19 1988 Springsteen 's concert in East Germany attracted 300,000 spectators. Journalist Erik Kirschbaum called the concert the most important rock concert ever anywhere in his 2013 book Rocking the Wall. Bruce Springsteen The Berlin Concert That Changed the World. The concert had been conceived by the Socialist Unity Party 's youth wing in an attempt to placate the youth of East Germany who were hungry for more freedom and the popular music of the West. However it is Kirschbaum 's opinion that the success of the concert catalyzed opposition to the regime in East Germany and helped contribute to the fall of the Berlin Wall the following year.Later in 1988 Springsteen headlined the worldwide Human Rights Now. tour for Amnesty International. In late 1989 he dissolved the Street Band. 1992–1998 Academy award Greatest Hits and soundtracks In 1992 after risking fan accusations of going Hollywood by moving to Los Angeles and working with session musicians Springsteen released two albums at once Human Touch and Lucky Town.An electric band appearance on the acoustic MTV Unplugged television program later released as In Concert/MTV Plugged was poorly received and cemented fan dissatisfaction. Springsteen seemed to realize this few years hence when he spoke humorously of his late father during his Rock and Roll Hall of Fame acceptance speech 've got ta thank him because—what would conceivably have written about without him. mean you can imagine that if everything had gone great between us we would have had disaster. would have written just happy songs—and tried it in the early '90s and it did n't work the public did n't like it. Springsteen won an Academy Award in 1994 for his song Streets of Philadelphia which appeared on the soundtrack to the film Philadelphia. The video for the song shows Springsteen 's actual vocal performance recorded using hidden microphone to prerecorded instrumental track. This technique was developed on the Brilliant Disguise video.In 1995 after temporarily re-organizing the Street Band for few new songs recorded for his first Greatest Hits album recording session that was chronicled in the documentary Blood Brothers and also one show at Tramps in New York City he released his second folk album The Ghost of Tom Joad. The album was inspired by John Steinbeck 's The Grapes of Wrath and by Journey to Nowhere The Saga of the New Underclass book by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Dale Maharidge and photographer Michael Williamson. The album was generally less well-received than the similar Nebraska due to the minimal melody twangy vocals and political nature of most of the songs however some praised it for giving voice to immigrants and others who rarely have one in American culture. The lengthy worldwide small-venue solo acoustic Ghost of Tom Joad Tour that followed successfully presented many of his older songs in drastically reshaped acoustic form although Springsteen had to explicitly remind his audiences to shut the fuck up and not to clap during the performances.Following the tour Springsteen moved from California back to New Jersey with his family. In 1998 he released the sprawling four-disc box set of outtakes Tracks. Later he would acknowledge that the 1990s were lost period for him did n't do lot of work. Some people would say did n't do my best work. 1999–2007 The Rising Devils Dust and other releases Springsteen was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1999 by Bono the lead singer of U2 favor he returned in 2005.In 1999 Springsteen and the Street Band reunited and began their extensive Reunion Tour which lasted over year. Highlights included record sold-out 15-show run at Continental Airlines Arena in East Rutherford New Jersey and ten-night sold-out engagement at New York City 's Madison Square Garden. new song American Skin 41 Shots about the police shooting of Amadou Diallo which was played at these shows proved controversial.In 2002 Springsteen released his first studio effort with the full band in 18 years The Rising produced by Brendan O'Brien. The album mostly reflection on the September 11 attacks was critical and popular success. The title track gained airplay in several radio formats and the record became Springsteen 's best-selling album of new material in 15 years. Kicked off by an early-morning Asbury Park appearance on The Today Show The Rising Tour commenced the band barnstormed through series of single-night arena stands in the U.S. and Europe. Springsteen played an unprecedented 10 nights in Giants Stadium in New Jersey.

In 2004 Springsteen and the Street Band participated in the Vote for Change tour along with John Mellencamp John Fogerty the Dixie Chicks Pearl Jam R.E.M. Bright Eyes the Dave Matthews Band Jackson Browne and other musicians. Devils Dust was released on April 26 2005 and was recorded without the Street Band. It is low-key mostly acoustic album in the same vein as Nebraska and The Ghost of Tom Joad. Some of the material was written almost 10 years earlier during or shortly after the Ghost of Tom Joad Tour with few having been performed then but not released. The title track concerns an ordinary soldier 's feelings and fears during the Iraq War. The album entered the charts at No. in 10 countries. Springsteen began the solo Devils Dust Tour at the same time as the album 's release playing both small and large venues. Attendance was disappointing in few regions and everywhere other than in Europe tickets were easier to get than in the past. In April 2006 Springsteen released We Shall Overcome The Seeger Sessions an American roots music project focused around big folk sound treatment of 15 songs popularized by the radical musical activism of Pete Seeger. tour began the same month with the 18-strong ensemble of musicians dubbed the Seeger Sessions Band and later shortened to the Sessions Band. The tour proved very popular in Europe selling out everywhere and receiving some excellent reviews but newspapers reported that number of U.S. shows suffered from sparse attendance.Springsteen 's next album entitled Magic was released on October 2007. Recorded with the Street Band it had 10 new Springsteen songs plus Long Walk Home performed once with the Sessions band and hidden track the first included on Springsteen studio release Terry 's Song tribute to Springsteen 's long-time assistant Terry Magovern who died on July 30 2007.

The set of appearances and promotional activities led Springsteen to say This has probably been the busiest month of my life.

Artistry and legacy Widely regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time Springsteen has been called rock 'n roll poet who radiates working-class authenticity. His work epitomizes rock 's deepest values desire the need for freedom and the search to find yourself. Often described as cinematic in their scope Springsteen 's lyrics frequently explore highly personal themes such as individual commitment dissatisfaction and dismay with life in context of everyday situations. Springsteen 's themes include social and political commentary and are rooted in the struggles faced by his own family of origin.In 2003 Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list included Born to Run 18 Born in the U.S.A. 85 The Wild the Innocent the Street Shuffle 132 Darkness on the Edge of Town 151 Nebraska 224 The River 250 Greetings from Asbury Park N.J. 379 and Tunnel of Love 475. In 2004 on their 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list Rolling Stone included Born to Run 21 Thunder Road 86 and Born in the U.S.A. 275. Acclaimed Music ranks him as the fifth most celebrated artist in popular music history.A shift in Springsteen 's lyrical approach began with the album Darkness on the Edge of Town in which he focused on the emotional struggles of working class life alongside more typical rock and roll themes. Reviewing Born in the U.S.A. Rolling Stone critic Debby Miller noted that Springsteen ignored the British Invasion and embraced instead the legacy of Phil Spector releases the sort of soul that was coming from Atlantic Records and especially the garage bands that had anomalous radio hits. He always chased the utopian feeling of that music .Jon Pareles included Springsteen among the pantheon of artists of the album era. Springsteen is the quintessential album-era rock star writes Ann Powers who argues that while other acts like the Beatles the Rolling Stones and Marvin Gaye probably made better individual works none had used the long-player form itself more powerfully over the arc of career not only to establish world through song but to inhabit an enduring persona. He used it to lyricize America 's slide from industrial-era swagger into service-economy anomie. In her mind Springsteen needed the track-by-track architecture of albums to flesh out characters relate each to the other extend metaphors and build palpable detail-strewn landscape through which they could travel. He simultaneously grew musically both with his stalwart Street Band metaphor itself for the family connections and community spirit his songs celebrate or lament and in more minimalist projects. Concert goers are often confused by the fact that Springsteen appears to be booed by his fans when he appears on stage. In fact his fans are calling his name in an exaggerated way as Bruuuce which sounds like boos. Personal life Relationships Springsteen dated actress Joyce Hyser for four years in the early 1980s. Previously he had dated photographer Lynn Goldsmith and model Karen Darvin. In the early 1980s he met Patti Scialfa at The Stone Pony bar in New Jersey the evening she was performing alongside his friend Bobby Bandiera with whom she had written At Least We Got Shoes for Southside Johnny.

Many of the songs on Tunnel of Love described the unhappiness he felt in his relationship with Phillips.

She expressed reluctance at first because she wanted to start recording her first solo album but when he told her the tour would be short she agreed to postpone her own solo record and join the tour. Phillips and Springsteen separated in the spring of 1988 but the separation was not made public. Springsteen and Scialfa fell in love during the Tunnel of Love Express Tour and started living together soon after his separation from Phillips. Citing irreconcilable differences Phillips filed for divorce in Los Angeles on August 30 1988 and settlement was reached in December and finalized on March 1989. They had no children. Springsteen received press criticism for the apparent haste in which he and Scialfa started their relationship. In 1995 interview with The Advocate he told Judy Wieder about the negative publicity the couple subsequently received It 's strange society that assumes it has the right to tell people whom they should love and whom they should n't. But the truth is basically ignored the entire thing as much as could. said 'Well all know is this feels real and maybe have got mess going here in some fashion but that 's life. Years later he reflected did n't protect Juli ... some sort of public announcement would have been fair but felt overly concerned about my own privacy. handled it badly and still feel badly about it.

But it does matter. It 's very different than just living together. First of all stepping up publicly—which is what you do You get your license you do all the social rituals—is part of your place in society and in some way part of society 's acceptance of you ... Patti and both found that it did mean something. When their children reached school age in the 1990s Springsteen and Scialfa moved back to New Jersey to raise them away from paparazzi. The family owns and lives on horse farm in Colts Neck Township and has home in Rumson they also own homes in Los Angeles and Wellington Florida.

Major film production studios in Vancouver and nearby Burnaby have turned Greater Vancouver and nearby areas into one of the largest film production centres in North America earning it the nickname Hollywood North. Etymology The city takes its name from George Vancouver who explored the inner harbour of Burrard Inlet in 1792 and gave various places British names. The family name Vancouver itself originates from the Dutch van Coevorden denoting somebody from the city of Coevorden Netherlands. The explorer 's ancestors came to England from Coevorden which is the origin of the name that eventually became Vancouver .The indigenous Squamish people who reside in region that encompasses southwestern British Columbia including this city gave the name K'emk'emeláy̓ which means place of many maple trees this was originally the name of village inhabited by said people where sawmill was established by Edward Stamp as part of the foundations to the British settlement later becoming part of Vancouver. History Before 1850 Archaeological records indicate that Aboriginal people were already living in the Vancouver area from 8,000 to 10,000 years ago. The city is located in the traditional and presently unceded territories of the Squamish Musqueam and Tsleil-Waututh Burrard peoples of the Coast Salish group. They had villages in various parts of present-day Vancouver such as Stanley Park False Creek Kitsilano Point Grey and near the mouth of the Fraser River. The region where Vancouver is currently located was referred to in contemporary Halkomelem as Lhq lets meaning wide at the bottom/end. Europeans became acquainted with the area of the future Vancouver when José María Narváez of Spain explored the coast of present-day Point Grey and parts of Burrard Inlet in 1791—although one author contends that Francis Drake may have visited the area in 1579. The explorer and North West Company trader Simon Fraser and his crew became the first-known Europeans to set foot on the site of the present-day city. In 1808 they travelled from the east down the Fraser River perhaps as far as Point Grey. Early growth The Fraser Gold Rush of 1858 brought over 25,000 men mainly from California to nearby New Westminster founded February 14 1859 on the Fraser River on their way to the Fraser Canyon bypassing what would become Vancouver. Vancouver is among British Columbia 's youngest cities the first European settlement in what is now Vancouver was not until 1862 at McCleery 's Farm on the Fraser River just east of the ancient village of Musqueam in what is now Marpole. sawmill established at Moodyville now the City of North Vancouver in 1863 began the city 's long relationship with logging. It was quickly followed by mills owned by Captain Edward Stamp on the south shore of the inlet. Stamp who had begun logging in the Port Alberni area first attempted to run mill at Brockton Point but difficult currents and reefs forced the relocation of the operation in 1867 to point near the foot of Dunlevy Street. This mill known as the Hastings Mill became the nucleus around which Vancouver formed. The mill 's central role in the city waned after the arrival of the Canadian Pacific Railway CPR in the 1880s. It nevertheless remained important to the local economy until it closed in the 1920s. The settlement which came to be called Gastown grew quickly around the original makeshift tavern established by Gassy Jack in 1867 on the edge of the Hastings Mill property.In 1870 the colonial government surveyed the settlement and laid out townsite renamed Granville in honour of the then–British Secretary of State for the Colonies Lord Granville. This site with its natural harbour was selected in 1884 as the terminus for the Canadian Pacific Railway to the disappointment of Port Moody New Westminster and Victoria all of which had vied to be the railhead. railway was among the inducements for British Columbia to join the Confederation in 1871 but the Pacific Scandal and arguments over the use of Chinese labour delayed construction until the 1880s. Incorporation The City of Vancouver was incorporated on April 1886 the same year that the first transcontinental train arrived. CPR president William Van Horne arrived in Port Moody to establish the CPR terminus recommended by Henry John Cambie and gave the city its name in honour of George Vancouver. The Great Vancouver Fire on June 13 1886 razed the entire city. The Vancouver Fire Department was established that year and the city quickly rebuilt. Vancouver 's population grew from settlement of 1,000 people in 1881 to over 20,000 by the turn of the century and 100,000 by 1911.Vancouver merchants outfitted prospectors bound for the Klondike Gold Rush in 1898. One of those merchants Charles Woodward had opened the first Woodward 's store at Abbott and Cordova Streets in 1892 and along with Spencer 's and the Hudson 's Bay department stores formed the core of the city 's retail sector for decades.The economy of early Vancouver was dominated by large companies such as the CPR which fuelled economic activity and led to the rapid development of the new city in fact the CPR was the main real estate owner and housing developer in the city. While some manufacturing did develop including the establishment of the British Columbia Sugar Refinery by Benjamin Tingley Rogers in 1890 natural resources became the basis for Vancouver 's economy. The resource sector was initially based on logging and later on exports moving through the seaport where commercial traffic constituted the largest economic sector in Vancouver by the 1930s. The 20th century The dominance of the economy by big business was accompanied by an often militant labour movement. The first major sympathy strike was in 1903 when railway employees struck against the CPR for union recognition. Labour leader Frank Rogers was killed by CPR police while picketing at the docks becoming the movement 's first martyr in British Columbia. 39–41 The rise of industrial tensions throughout the province led to Canada 's first general strike in 1918 at the Cumberland coal mines on Vancouver Island. 71–74 Following lull in the 1920s the strike wave peaked in 1935 when unemployed men flooded the city to protest conditions in the relief camps run by the military in remote areas throughout the province. After two tense months of daily and disruptive protesting the relief camp strikers decided to take their grievances to the federal government and embarked on the On-to-Ottawa Trek but their protest was put down by force. The workers were arrested near Mission and interned in work camps for the duration of the Depression.Other social movements such as the first-wave feminist moral reform and temperance movements were also instrumental in Vancouver 's development. Mary Ellen Smith Vancouver suffragist and prohibitionist became the first woman elected to provincial legislature in Canada in 1918. 172 Alcohol prohibition began in the First World War and lasted until 1921 when the provincial government established control over alcohol sales practice still in place today. 187–188 Canada 's first drug law came about following an inquiry conducted by the federal minister of Labour and future prime minister William Lyon Mackenzie King. King was sent to investigate damages claims resulting from riot when the Asiatic Exclusion League led rampage through Chinatown and Japantown. Two of the claimants were opium manufacturers and after further investigation King found that white women were reportedly frequenting opium dens as well as Chinese men. federal law banning the manufacture sale and importation of opium for non-medicinal purposes was soon passed based on these revelations. These riots and the formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League also act as signs of growing fear and mistrust towards the Japanese living in Vancouver and throughout BC. These fears were exacerbated by the attack on Pearl Harbor leading to the eventual internment or deportation of all Japanese-Canadians living in the city and the province. After the war these Japanese-Canadian men and women were not allowed to return to cities like Vancouver causing areas like the aforementioned Japantown to cease to be ethnically Japanese areas as the communities never revived.Amalgamation with Point Grey and South Vancouver gave the city its final boundaries not long before it became the third-largest metropolis in the country. As of January 1929 the population of the enlarged Vancouver was 228,193. Geography Located on the Burrard Peninsula Vancouver lies between Burrard Inlet to the north and the Fraser River to the south. The Strait of Georgia to the west is shielded from the Pacific Ocean by Vancouver Island. The city has an area of 115.18 km2 44.47 sq mi including both flat and hilly ground and is in the Pacific Time Zone UTC−8 and the Pacific Maritime Ecozone.Until the city 's naming in 1885 Vancouver referred to Vancouver Island and it remains common misconception that the city is located on the island. The island and the city are both named after Royal Navy Captain George Vancouver as is the city of Vancouver Washington in the United States. Vancouver has one of the largest urban parks in North America Stanley Park which covers 404.9 ha 1,001 acres. The North Shore Mountains dominate the cityscape and on clear day scenic vistas include the snow-capped volcano Mount Baker in the state of Washington to the southeast Vancouver Island across the Strait of Georgia to the west and southwest and Bowen Island to the northwest. Ecology The vegetation in the Vancouver area was originally temperate rainforest consisting of conifers with scattered pockets of maple and alder and large areas of swampland even in upland areas due to poor drainage. The conifers were typical coastal British Columbia mix of Douglas fir western red cedar and western hemlock. The area is thought to have had the largest trees of these species on the British Columbia Coast. Only in Elliott Bay Seattle did the size of trees rival those of Burrard Inlet and English Bay. The largest trees in Vancouver 's old-growth forest were in the Gastown area where the first logging occurred and on the southern slopes of False Creek and English Bay especially around Jericho Beach. The forest in Stanley Park was logged between the 1860s and 1880s and evidence of old-fashioned logging techniques such as springboard notches can still be seen there.Many plants and trees growing throughout Vancouver and the Lower Mainland were imported from other parts of the continent and from points across the Pacific. Examples include the monkey puzzle tree the Japanese maple and various flowering exotics such as magnolias azaleas and rhododendrons. Some species imported from harsher climates in Eastern Canada or Europe have grown to immense sizes. The native Douglas maple can also attain tremendous size. Many of the city 's streets are lined with flowering varieties of Japanese cherry trees donated from the 1930s onward by the government of Japan. These flower for several weeks in early spring each year an occasion celebrated by the Vancouver Cherry Blossom Festival. Other streets are lined with flowering chestnut horse chestnut and other decorative shade trees. Climate Vancouver is one of Canada 's warmest cities in the winter. Vancouver 's climate is temperate by Canadian standards and is classified as oceanic or marine west coast Köppen climate classification Cfb that borders on warm-summer Mediterranean climate Csb. While during summer months the inland temperatures are significantly higher Vancouver has the coolest summer average high of all major Canadian metropolitan areas. The summer months are typically dry with an average of only one in five days during July and August receiving precipitation. In contrast the majority of days from November through March record some type of precipitation.Vancouver is also one of the wettest Canadian cities. However precipitation varies throughout the metropolitan area. Annual precipitation as measured at Vancouver International Airport in Richmond averages 1,189 mm 46.8 in compared with 1,588 mm 62.5 in in the downtown area and 2,044 mm 80.5 in in North Vancouver. The daily maximum averages 22 °C 72 °F in July and August with highs rarely reaching 30 °C 86 °F .The highest temperature ever recorded at the airport was 34.4 °C 93.9 °F set on July 30 2009 and the highest temperature ever recorded within the city of Vancouver was 35.0 °C 95.0 °F occurring first on July 31 1965 again on August 1981 and also on May 29 1983. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was −17.8 °C 0.0 °F on January 14 1950 and again on December 29 1968.On average snow falls on nine days per year with three days receiving cm 2.0 in or more. Average yearly snowfall is 38.1 cm 15.0 in but typically does not remain on the ground for long.Winters in Greater Vancouver are the fourth-mildest of Canadian cities after nearby Victoria Nanaimo and Duncan all on Vancouver Island. Vancouver 's growing season averages 237 days from March 18 until November 10. Vancouver 's 1981–2010 USDA Plant Hardiness Zone ranges from 8A to 9A depending on elevation and proximity to water. Cityscape Urban planning As of 2021 Vancouver is the most densely populated city in Canada. Urban planning in Vancouver is characterized by high-rise residential and mixed-use development in urban centres as an alternative to sprawl. As part of the larger Metro Vancouver region it is influenced by the policy direction of livability as illustrated in Metro Vancouver 's Regional Growth Strategy. Vancouver has been ranked one of the most livable cities in the world for more than decade. As of 2019 Vancouver has been ranked as having the third-highest quality of living of any city on Earth. In contrast according to Forbes Vancouver had the fourth-most expensive real estate market in the world in 2019. Vancouver has also been ranked among Canada 's most expensive cities to live in. Sales in February 2016 were 56.3 percent higher than the 10-year average for the month. Forbes also ranked Vancouver as the tenth-cleanest city in the world in 2007.Vancouver 's characteristic approach to urban planning originated in the late 1950s when city planners began to encourage the building of high-rise residential towers in Vancouver 's West End subject to strict requirements for setbacks and open space to protect sight lines and preserve green space. The success of these dense but livable neighbourhoods led to the redevelopment of urban industrial sites such as North False Creek and Coal Harbour beginning in the mid-1980s. The result is compact urban core that has gained international recognition for its high amenity and 'livable development. In 2006 the city launched planning initiative entitled EcoDensity with the stated goal of exploring ways in which density design and land use can contribute to environmental sustainability affordability and livability. Architecture The Vancouver Art Gallery is housed downtown in the neoclassical former courthouse built in 1906. The courthouse building was designed by Francis Rattenbury who also designed the British Columbia Parliament Buildings and the Empress Hotel in Victoria and the lavishly decorated second Hotel Vancouver. The 556-room Hotel Vancouver opened in 1939 and the third by that name is across the street with its copper roof. The Gothic-style Christ Church Cathedral across from the hotel opened in 1894 and was declared heritage building in 1976. There are several modern buildings in the downtown area including the Harbour Centre the Vancouver Law Courts and surrounding plaza known as Robson Square designed by Arthur Erickson and the Vancouver Library Square designed by Moshe Safdie and DA Architects reminiscent of the Colosseum in Rome and the recently completed Woodward 's building Redevelopment designed by Henriquez Partners Architects.

Ethnicity Vancouver has been called city of neighbourhoods. Each neighbourhood in Vancouver has distinct character and ethnic mix. People of English Scottish and Irish origins were historically the largest ethnic groups in the city and elements of British society and culture are still visible in some areas particularly South Granville and Kerrisdale. Germans are the next-largest European ethnic group in Vancouver and were leading force in the city 's society and economy until the rise of anti-German sentiment with the outbreak of World War in 1914. Today the Chinese are the largest visible ethnic group in Vancouver the city has diverse Chinese-speaking community with speakers of several dialects notably Cantonese and Mandarin. Neighbourhoods with distinct ethnic commercial areas include Chinatown Punjabi Market Little Italy Greektown and formerly Japantown. Since the 1980s immigration increased substantially making the city more ethnically and linguistically diverse 49 percent of Vancouver 's residents do not speak English as their first language. Over 25 percent of the city 's inhabitants are of Chinese heritage. In the 1980s an influx of immigrants from Hong Kong in anticipation of the transfer of sovereignty from the United Kingdom to China combined with an increase in immigrants from mainland China and previous immigrants from Taiwan established in Vancouver one of the highest concentrations of ethnic Chinese residents in North America. Another significant Asian ethnic group in Vancouver includes South Asians forming approximately percent of the city 's inhabitants while small community had existed in the city since 1897 larger waves of migration began in the 1950s and 1960s prompting new Punjabi immigrants to establish Little India known as Punjabi Market and preside over much of the mass construction of the Vancouver Special across the southeastern quadrant of the city notably within the Sunset neighbourhood prior to the suburbanization of the community to outer suburbs such as Surrey or Delta.Other Asian-origin groups that reside in Vancouver include Filipinos 5.9 Japanese 1.7 Korean 1.7 West Asians 1.9 as well as sizable communities of Vietnamese Indonesians and Cambodians. Despite increases in Latin American immigration to Vancouver in the 1980s and 1990s recent immigration has been comparatively low. Although growth in the Latino population arose in the late 2010s and early 2020s and which largely consists of Mexicans Salvadorans and other groups. African immigration has been similarly stagnant 3.6 and 3.3 of total immigrant population respectively. The black population of Vancouver is small in comparison to other Canadian major cities making up 1.3 percent of the city. Hogan 's Alley small area adjacent to Chinatown just off Main Street at Prior was once home to significant black community. The Black population consists of Somalis Jamaicans/Caribbeans and other groups including those who descended from African Americans. The neighbourhood of Strathcona was the core of the city 's Jewish community. In 1981 approximately 24 percent of the city population belonged to visible minority group 127 at the same time this proportion was roughly 14 percent for the entire metropolitan area. By 2016 the proportion in the city had grown to 52 percent.Prior to the Hong Kong diaspora of the 1990s the largest non-British ethnic groups in the city were Irish and German followed by Scandinavian Italian Ukrainian Chinese and Punjabi.

Economy With its location on the Pacific Rim and at the western terminus of Canada 's transcontinental highway and rail routes Vancouver is one of the nation 's largest industrial centres. Port Metro Vancouver Canada 's largest and most diversified port does more than 172 billion in trade with over 160 different trading economies annually. Port activities generate 9.7 billion in gross domestic product and 20.3 billion in economic output. Vancouver is also the headquarters of forest product and mining companies. In recent years Vancouver has become centre for software development biotechnology aerospace video game development animation studios and television production and film industry. Vancouver hosts approximately 65 movies and 55 TV series annually and is the 3rd largest film TV production centre in North America supporting 20,000 jobs.

The city has adopted various strategies to reduce housing costs including cooperative housing legalized secondary suites increased density and smart growth. As of April 2010 the average two-level home in Vancouver sold for record high of 987,500 compared with the Canadian average of 365,141. factor explaining the high property prices may be policies by the Canadian government which permit snow washing which allows foreigners to buy property in Canada while shielding their identities from tax authorities making real estate transactions an effective way to conduct money laundering.Since the 1990s development of high-rise condominia in the downtown peninsula has been financed in part by an inflow of capital from Hong Kong immigrants due to the former colony 's 1997 handover to China. Such development has clustered in the Yaletown and Coal Harbour districts and around many of the SkyTrain stations to the east of the downtown. The city 's selection to co-host the 2010 Winter Olympics was also major influence on economic development. Concern was expressed that Vancouver 's increasing homelessness problem would be exacerbated by the Olympics because owners of single room occupancy hotels which house many of the city 's lowest income residents converted their properties to attract higher income residents and tourists. Another significant international event held in Vancouver the 1986 World Exposition received over 20 million visitors and added 3.7 billion to the Canadian economy. Some still-standing Vancouver landmarks including the SkyTrain public transit system and Canada Place were built as part of the exposition. Government Vancouver unlike other British Columbia municipalities is incorporated under the Vancouver Charter. The legislation passed in 1953 supersedes the Vancouver Incorporation Act 1921 and grants the city more and different powers than other communities possess under BC 's Municipalities Act. The civic government was dominated by the centre-right Non-Partisan Association NPA since World War II albeit with some significant centre-left interludes until 2008. The NPA fractured over the issue of drug policy in 2002 facilitating landslide victory for the Coalition of Progressive Electors COPE on harm reduction platform.

Unusually for city of Vancouver 's size all municipal elections are on an at-large basis. Historically in all levels of government the more affluent west side of Vancouver has voted along conservative or liberal lines while the eastern side of the city has voted along left-wing lines. This was reaffirmed with the results of the 2005 provincial election and the 2006 federal election. Though polarized political consensus has emerged in Vancouver around number of issues. Protection of urban parks focus on the development of rapid transit as opposed to freeway system harm-reduction approach to illegal drug use and general concern about community-based development are examples of policies that have come to have broad support across the political spectrum in Vancouver.In the 2008 municipal election campaign NPA incumbent mayor Sam Sullivan was ousted as mayoral candidate by the party in close vote which instated Peter Ladner as the new mayoral candidate for the NPA. Gregor Robertson former MLA for Vancouver-Fairview and head of Happy Planet was the mayoral candidate for Vision Vancouver the other main contender. Vision Vancouver candidate Gregor Robertson defeated Ladner by considerable margin nearing 20,000 votes. The balance of power was significantly shifted to Vision Vancouver which held seven of the 10 spots for councillor. Of the remaining three COPE received two and the NPA one. For park commissioner four spots went to Vision Vancouver one to the Green Party one to COPE and one to NPA. For school trustee there were four Vision Vancouver seats three COPE seats and two NPA seats. In the 2018 Vancouver municipal election independent Kennedy Stewart was elected mayor of Vancouver. Stewart was later defeated as mayor in the 2022 Vancouver municipal election by Ken Sim the runner-up in the 2018 election.Vancouver 's budget consists of capital and an operating component. The 2017 operating budget was 1.323 billion while the 2018 operating budget is 1.407 billion year over year increase of 6.4. The capital budget for 2018 is unchanged from 2017 and stands at 426.4 million. Budget increases are largely funded through increases in property taxes and community amenity contributions imposed in exchange for increases in allowable density as part of the construction permitting process. Utility fees and other user fees have also been increased but represent comparatively small portion of Vancouver 's overall budget. Regional government Along with 20 other municipalities one electoral area and one treaty First Nation Vancouver is member municipality of Metro Vancouver the regional government whose seat is in Burnaby. While each member of Metro Vancouver has its own separate local governing body Metro Vancouver oversees common services and planning functions within the area such as providing drinking water operating sewage and solid waste handling maintaining regional parks overseeing air quality greenhouse gases and ecological health and providing strategy for regional growth and land use.

Before the legalization of marijuana Vancouver police generally did not arrest people for possessing small amounts of marijuana. In 2000 the Vancouver Police Department established specialized drug squad Growbusters to carry out an aggressive campaign against the city 's estimated 4,000 hydroponic marijuana growing operations or grow-ops in residential areas. As with other law enforcement campaigns targeting marijuana this initiative has been sharply criticized. As of 2018 Vancouver had the ninth-highest crime rate dropping spots since 2005 among Canada 's 35 census metropolitan areas. However as with other Canadian cities the overall crime rate has been falling dramatically. The rate of firearm related violence dropped from 45.3 per 100,000 in 2006 the highest of any major metropolitan region in Canada at that time to 16.2 in 2017. series of gang-related incidents in early 2009 escalated into what police have dubbed gang war. Vancouver plays host to special events such as the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation conference the Clinton-Yeltsin Summit or the Symphony of Fire fireworks show that require significant policing. The 1994 Stanley Cup riot overwhelmed police and injured as many as 200 people. second riot took place following the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals.To reduce the public health risk from discarded hypodermic needles which are commonly found on the streets of downtown and the adjacent Downtown Eastside the city runs continuous collection effort recovering approximately 1000 needles per day from public spaces.

Transportation Vancouver 's streetcar system began on June 28 1890 and ran from the first Granville Street Bridge to Westminster Avenue now Main Street and Kingsway. Less than year later the Westminster and Vancouver Tramway Company began operating Canada 's first interurban line between the two cities extended to Chilliwack in 1910. Another line 1902 the Vancouver and Lulu Island Railway was leased by the Canadian Pacific Railway to the British Columbia Electric Railway in 1905 and ran from the Granville Street Bridge to Steveston via Kerrisdale which encouraged residential neighbourhoods outside the central core to develop. From 1897 the British Columbia Electric Railway BCER became the company that operated the urban and interurban rail system until 1958 when its last vestiges were dismantled in favour of trackless trolley and gasoline/diesel buses in that same year the BCER became the core of the newly created publicly owned BC Hydro. Vancouver currently has the second-largest trolleybus fleet in North America after San Francisco. Successive city councils in the 1970s and 1980s prohibited the construction of freeways as part of long-term plan. As result the only major freeway within city limits is Highway which passes through the north-eastern corner of the city. While the number of cars in Vancouver proper has been steadily rising with population growth the rate of car ownership and the average distance driven by daily commuters have fallen since the early 1990s. Vancouver is the only major Canadian city with these trends. Despite the fact that the journey time per vehicle has increased by one-third and growing traffic mass there are percent fewer cars making trips into the downtown core. In 2012 Vancouver had the worst traffic congestion in Canada and the second-highest in North America behind Los Angeles. As of 2013 Vancouver now has the worst traffic congestion in North America. Residents have been more inclined to live in areas closer to their interests or use more energy-efficient means of travel such as mass transit and cycling. This is in part the result of push by city planners for solution to traffic problems and pro-environment campaigns. Transportation demand management policies have imposed restrictions on drivers making it more difficult and expensive to commute while introducing more benefits for non-drivers. TransLink is responsible for roads and public transportation within Metro Vancouver in succession to BC Transit which had taken over the transit functions of BC Hydro. It provides bus service including the RapidBus express service foot passenger and bicycle ferry service known as SeaBus an automated rapid transit service called SkyTrain and West Coast Express commuter rail. Vancouver 's SkyTrain system is currently running on three lines the Millennium Line the Expo Line and the Canada Line with total of 53 stations as of 2017. Only 20 of these stations are within the City of Vancouver borders with the remainders in the adjacent suburbs. number of city 's biggest tourist attractions such as English Bay Stanley Park the Vancouver Aquarium University of British Columbia with the Museum of Anthropology and Kitsilano are not connected by this rapid transit system. Changes are being made to the regional transportation network as part of Translink 's 10-Year Transportation Plan. The Canada Line opened on August 17 2009 connects Vancouver International Airport and the neighbouring city of Richmond with the existing SkyTrain system. The Evergreen Extension which opened on December 2016 links the cities of Coquitlam and Port Moody with the SkyTrain system. As of January 2019 plans to extend the SkyTrain Millennium Line west to UBC as subway under Broadway have been approved and there are plans for capacity upgrades and an extension to the Expo Line. Several road projects will be completed within the next few years as part of the Provincial Government 's Gateway Program.Other modes of transport add to the diversity of options available in Vancouver. Inter-city passenger rail service is operated from Pacific Central Station by Via Rail to points east Amtrak Cascades to Seattle and Portland and Rocky Mountaineer rail tour routes. Small passenger ferries operating in False Creek provide commuter service to Granville Island Downtown Vancouver and Kitsilano.

The bicycle-sharing system Mobi was introduced to the city in June 2016.Vancouver is served by Vancouver International Airport YVR located on Sea Island in the city of Richmond immediately south of Vancouver. Vancouver 's airport is Canada 's second-busiest airport and the second-largest gateway on the west coast of North America for international passengers. HeliJet and float plane companies operate scheduled air service from Vancouver harbour and YVR south terminal. The city is also served by two BC Ferry terminals. One is to the northwest at Horseshoe Bay in West Vancouver and the other is to the south at Tsawwassen in Delta.

Vancouver has over 1,298 ha 3,210 acres of parks of which Stanley Park at 404 ha 1,000 acres is the largest. The city has several large beaches many adjacent to one another extending from the shoreline of Stanley Park around False Creek to the south side of English Bay from Kitsilano to the University Endowment Lands which also has beaches that are not part of the city proper. The 18 km 11 mi of beaches include Second and Third Beaches in Stanley Park English Bay First Beach Sunset Kitsilano Beach Jericho Locarno Spanish Banks Spanish Banks Extension Spanish Banks West and Wreck Beach.

The island is the largest by area and the most populous along the west coasts of the Americas. The southern part of Vancouver Island and some of the nearby Gulf Islands are the only parts of British Columbia or Western Canada to lie south of the 49th parallel. The southeast part of the island has one of the warmest climates in Canada and since the mid-1990s has been mild enough in few areas to grow Mediterranean crops such as olives and lemons.The population of Vancouver Island was 864,864 as of 2021. Nearly half of that population ~400,000 live in the metropolitan area of Greater Victoria on the southern tip of the island which includes Victoria the capital of British Columbia. Other notable cities and towns on Vancouver Island include Nanaimo Campbell River Courtenay Port Alberni and Parksville all on or near the east coast. Indigenous peoples have inhabited Vancouver Island for thousands of years long before the arrival of Spanish and British naval expeditions in the late 18th century. The Spanish and British conjointly named it Quadra 's and Vancouver 's Island in commemoration of the friendly negotiations held in 1792 between the Spanish commander of Fort San Miguel in Nootka Sound Juan Francisco de la Bodega Quadra and British naval captain George Vancouver during the Nootka Crisis. Bodega Quadra 's name was eventually dropped. It is one of several North American locations named after George Vancouver who between 1791 and 1794 explored the Pacific Northwest. Vancouver Island is the world 's 43rd largest island Canada 's 11th largest island and Canada 's second most populous island after the Island of Montreal.","Vancouver Island is an island in the northeastern Pacific Ocean and part of the Canadian province of British Columbia.

Vancouver Island is the world 's 43rd largest island Canada 's 11th largest island and Canada 's second most populous island after the Island of Montreal. History Indigenous peoples Vancouver Island has been the homeland to many indigenous peoples for thousands of years. The groupings by language are the Kwakwakaʼwakw also known as the Kwakiutl Nuu-chah-nulth and various Coast Salish peoples. While there is some overlap Kwakwakaʼwakw territory includes northern and northwestern Vancouver Island and adjoining areas of the mainland the Nuu-chah-nulth span most of the west coast while the Coast Salish cover the southeastern Island and southernmost extremities along the Strait of Juan de Fuca. Their cultures are connected to the natural resources abundant in the area. ==== Kwakwakaʼwakw ==== The Kwakwakaʼwakw today number about 5,500 who live in British Columbia on northern Vancouver Island and the mainland. They are also known as Kwakiutl in English from one of their tribes but they prefer their autonym Kwakwakaʼwakw. Their indigenous language part of the Wakashan family is Kwakʼwala. The name Kwakwakaʼwakw means speakers of Kwakʼwala. The language is now spoken by less than of the population—about 250 people. Today 17 separate tribes make up the Kwakwakaʼwakw. Some Kwakwakaʼwakw groups are now extinct. Kwakʼwala is Northern Wakashan language grouping shared with Haisla Heiltsuk and Wuikyala. Kwakwakaʼwakw centres of population on Vancouver Island include communities such as Fort Rupert Alert Bay and Quatsino The Kwakwakaʼwakw tradition of the potlatch was banned by the federal government of Canada in 1885 but has been revived in recent decades. ==== Nuu-chah-nulth ==== The Nuu-chah-nulth pronounced nuːʧanˀuɬ are indigenous peoples in Canada. Their traditional home is on the west coast of Vancouver Island. In pre-contact and early post-contact times the number of nations was much greater but as in the rest of the region smallpox and other consequences of contact resulted in the disappearance of some groups and the absorption of others into neighbouring groups. They were among the first Pacific peoples north of California to come into contact with Europeans as the Spanish Americans and British attempted to secure control of Pacific Northwest and the trade in otter pelts with Nootka Sound becoming focus of these rivalries. The Nuu-chah-nulth speak Southern Wakashan language and are closely related to the Makah of the Olympic Peninsula Washington state and the Ditidaht. ==== Coast Salish ==== The Coast Salish are the largest of the southern groups. They are loose grouping of many tribes with numerous distinct cultures and historically speak one of the Coast Salish languages. On Vancouver Island Coast Salish peoples territory traditionally spans from the northern limit of the Strait of Georgia on the east side of Vancouver Island and covering most of southern Vancouver Island. Distinct nations within the Coast Salish peoples on Vancouver Island include the Stz'uminus the Kʼómoks of the Comox Valley area the Cowichan of the Cowichan Valley the Esquimalt the Saanich of the Saanich Peninsula the Songhees of the Victoria area and Snuneymuxw in the Nanaimo area. European exploration Europeans began to explore the island in 1774 when rumours of Russian fur traders caused Spain to send number of expeditions to assert its long-held claims to the Pacific Northwest. The first expedition was that of the Santiago under the command of Juan José Pérez Hernández. In 1775 second Spanish expedition under the Spanish Peruvian captain Juan Francisco de la Bodega Quadra was sent. By 1776 Spanish exploration had reached Bucareli Bay including the mouth of the Columbia River between Oregon and Washington and Sitka Sound.Vancouver Island came to the attention of Britain after the third voyage of Captain James Cook who spent month during 1778 at Nootka Sound on the island 's western coast. Cook claimed it for Great Britain. Maritime fur trader John Meares arrived in 1786 and set up single-building trading post near the native village of Yuquot Friendly Cove at the entrance to Nootka Sound in 1788. The fur trade began expanding into the island eventually leading to permanent settlement. Dispute over sovereignty The island was further explored by Spain in 1789 with Esteban José Martínez who established the settlement of Yuquot and the artillery battery of Fort San Miguel at Friendly Cove which Spain called Puerto de San Lorenzo de Nuca. This was to be the only Spanish settlement in what would later be Canada. Asserting their claim of exclusive sovereignty and navigation rights the Spanish force seized the Portuguese-flagged British ships.British naval captain George Vancouver was sent to Nootka Sound in 1792 in order to negotiate settlement. His Spanish counterpart in the negotiations was Juan Francisco de la Bodega Quadra who was commandant of Santa Cruz de Nuca in 1792. Vancouver had sailed as midshipman with Cook. The negotiations between Vancouver and Bodega Quadra ended in deadlock with nothing resolved. Vancouver insisted the entire Spanish establishment be turned over but Bodega Quadra held that there were no buildings seized in 1789 and the only possible land was tiny and useless cove nearby. The two decided to refer the entire matter back to their respective governments. The friendly meeting between Bodega Quadra and Vancouver led the former to propose that the island be named after both Quadra and Vancouver Island which became the original name. While we know this island today as Vancouver Island the British explorer had not intentionally meant to name such large body of land solely after himself. In his September 1792 dispatch log report for the British Admiralty Captain Vancouver reveals that his decision here was rather meant to honour request by Bodega Quadra that Vancouver would name some port or island after us both in commemoration of our meeting and friendly intercourse that on that occasion had taken place Vancouver had previously feted Bodega Quadra on his ship .... and conceiving no place more eligible than the place of our meeting have therefore named this land ... The Island of Quadra and Vancouver. Bodega Quadra wrote however that it was Vancouver who made the suggestion of combining their names to designate some geographical feature. In 1792 the Spanish explorer Dionisio Alcalá Galiano and his crew were the first Europeans to circumnavigate Vancouver Island. On April 1806 Captain John D'Wolf of Bristol Rhode Island sailed the Juno to Nahwitti Newettee small inlet in the northwestern promontory of Vancouver 's Island. The captain described Newettee as one of the southernmost harbours frequented by American fur traders at 51 degrees north and 128 degrees west. He relates that since Captain Robert Gray of Tiverton Rhode Island had sailed the Columbia River in 1792 the trade of the northwest coast had been almost entirely in the hands of Boston merchants so much so that the natives called all traders Boston Men. settlement was not successfully negotiated and ownership of the island remained in dispute between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Spanish Empire in the early 1790s. The two countries nearly began war over the issue the confrontation became known as the Nootka Crisis. That was averted when both agreed to recognize the other 's rights to the area in the first Nootka Convention in 1790 first step to peace. Finally the two countries signed the second Nootka Convention in 1793 and the third Convention in 1794. As per that final agreement the Spanish dismantled their fort at Nootka and left the area giving the British sovereignty over Vancouver Island and the adjoining islands including the Gulf Islands .For decades Quadra 's and Vancouver 's Island was the most prominent name on maps of the coast and appeared on most British French and Spanish maps of the period. But as Spanish interests in the region dwindled so did the use of Bodega Quadra 's name. The Hudson 's Bay Company played major part in the transition by 1824 'Vancouver 's Island had become the usual designation in its correspondence for the island.A quarter of century later Vancouver Island had become such well-known geographical feature that the founding of the Colony of Vancouver Island in 1849 gave this name full official status. Period references to Vancouver referred to Vancouver Island until the naming of the city of Vancouver in 1885. British settlement By March 1843 James Douglas of the Hudson 's Bay Company and missionary had arrived and selected an area for settlement. Construction of the fort began in June of that year. This settlement was fur trading post originally named Fort Albert afterward Fort Victoria. The fort was located at the Songhees settlement of Camosack Camosun 200 660 ft northwest of the present-day Empress Hotel on Victoria 's Inner Harbour. In 1846 the Oregon Treaty which ended the Oregon boundary dispute was signed by the British and the United States to settle the question of the U.S. Oregon Country borders. The Treaty made the 49th parallel latitude north the official border between the two countries. In order to ensure that Britain retained all of Vancouver Island and the southern Gulf Islands however it was agreed that the border would swing south around that area.In 1849 the Colony of Vancouver Island was established. The Colony was leased to the Hudson 's Bay Company HBC for an annual fee of seven shillings the company 's responsibility in return was to increase the population by promoting colonisation. The first independent settler arrived that year Captain Walter Grant started homestead in Sooke. Following the brief governorship of Richard Blanshard James Douglas Chief Factor of the Hudson 's Bay post assumed the role in 1851. The island 's first legislative assembly was formed in 1856. Government buildings were built and were occupied in 1859 the replacement today 's Parliament Buildings were opened in 1898.Fort Victoria had become an important base when prospectors miners and merchants began arriving for the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush in 1858. The Hudson 's Bay lease expired in 1859 and the island reverted to Great Britain. The burgeoning town was incorporated as Victoria in 1862. Victoria became the capital of the colony of Vancouver Island retaining this status when the island was amalgamated with the mainland in 1866.A British naval base including Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard and naval hospital was established at Esquimalt in 1865 and eventually taken over by the Canadian military. Today as CFB Esquimalt it is the home port of the Maritime Forces Pacific and parts are designated as National Historic Sites of Canada. ==== Union and Confederation ==== The economic situation of the colony declined following the Cariboo Gold Rush of 1861–1862 and pressure grew for amalgamation of the colony with the mainland colony of British Columbia which had been established in 1858. The two colonies were merged in 1866 into the United Colonies of Vancouver Island and British Columbia by the Act for the Union of the colonies passed by the Imperial Parliament. Arthur Kennedy was appointed governor of the united entity. He would leave office in 1866 and later became Governor of the West African Settlements British West Africa. Victoria became the capital but the legislative assembly was located in New Westminster on the Lower Mainland. The capital was moved to Victoria in 1868. ==== Confederation ==== By 1867 Canada was established by the first of the British North America Acts the Constitution Act 1867 and the United Colonies joined Canada on 20 July 1871 through the British Columbia Terms of Union following negotiations that secured the interests of the colonial elite in relation to rail connection that would unite the colonies with the rest of Canada establish Indian lands policy that would effectively perpetuate BC 's pre-Confederation practices and enshrine colonial officials security of position. Victoria was named the capital of the province of British Columbia. Three delegates were appointed to the federal government. Geography Vancouver Island is located in the southwestern corner of the province of British Columbia. It is separated from the mainland of British Columbia by Johnstone Strait and Queen Charlotte Strait on the north and northeast and by the Strait of Georgia on the southeast which along with the Strait of Juan de Fuca along its southwest separate it from the United States. West of the island is the open Pacific Ocean while to its north is Queen Charlotte Sound. The Straits of Georgia and Juan de Fuca are now officially part of the Salish Sea which also includes Puget Sound.The Vancouver Island Ranges run most of the length of the island dividing it into wet and rugged west coast and drier more rolling east coast. The highest point in these ranges and on the island is the Golden Hinde at 2,195 7,201 ft. Located near the centre of Vancouver Island in 2,500 km2 970 sq mi Strathcona Provincial Park it is part of group of peaks that include the only glaciers on the island the largest of which is the Comox Glacier. The west coast shoreline is rugged and in many places mountainous characterized by its many fjords bays and inlets. The interior of the island has many lakes Kennedy Lake north of Ucluelet is the largest and rivers.The 49th parallel north crosses the island just north of Ladysmith on the east and Ucluelet on the west. Southern Vancouver Island is typically considered to refer to the area south of Courtenay while Northern Vancouver Island generally refers to the area north of Campbell River. Those cities and the area between them are sometimes described as Mid-Island or Central Island. Lakes Rivers There are number of rivers draining the island some of which though short are large in volume. Among the more notable rivers are the Somass River in the Alberni Valley the Nimpkish River in the North Island region the Englishman River up island from Nanaimo near Parksville and the Cowichan River whose basin forms the Cowichan Valley region in the South Island region. Climate The climate of Vancouver Island is the mildest in Canada with temperatures on the coast even in January being usually above °C 32 °F. In summer the warmest days usually have maximum of 28–33 °C 82–91 °F. The southeastern part of the island notably has warm-summer Csb Mediterranean climate with numerous vineyards. The rain shadow effect of the island 's mountains as well as the mountains of Washington 's Olympic Peninsula creates wide variation in precipitation. The west coast is considerably wetter than the east coast. Average annual precipitation ranges from 6,650 mm 262 in at Hucuktlis Lake on the west coast making it the wettest place in North America to only 608 mm 23.9 in at Victoria Gonzales the driest recording station in the provincial capital of Victoria. Precipitation is heaviest in the autumn and winter. Snow is rare at low altitudes but is common on the island 's mountaintops in winter. Skiing is popular at Mount Washington in the mid-island with an elevation of 1,588 5,210 ft. notable feature of Vancouver Island is the extension of summer dryness to latitudes as high as 50 °N. Only in the extreme north of the island near Port Hardy is the rainfall of the driest summer month as much as one fifth that of the wettest months from November to March. West coasts of other continents at similar latitudes have practically even distribution of rainfall through the year. Geology Vancouver Island is mostly made up of volcanic and sedimentary rock which was formed offshore on the now disappeared Kula oceanic plate. Around 55 million years ago during the Paleogene Period microplate of the Kula Plate subducted below the North American continental margin with great strain. volcanic arc on the surface of the Kula Plate was thus accreted and fused onto the western edge of North America. These terranes were subjected to extreme warping from continued subduction of the Kula plate leading to the formation of the distorted Insular Mountains. Much of the central mountainous region around Strathcona Park is part of the Karmutsen Formation which is sequence of tholeiitic pillow basalts and breccias. Since Vancouver Island has become an accretionary wedge on the North American continent the Kula Plate has fully subducted beneath it and the remnants of the Farallon Plate the Juan de Fuca Plate are now subducting below the island. This process has led to Vancouver Island being one of the most seismically active regions in Canada. The subduction zone off the coast of the island forms section of the Ring of Fire. The area has been known to host megathrust earthquakes in the past the last being the Cascadia earthquake of 1700. The Forbidden Plateau in the east of the Vancouver Island Ranges was the epicentre of the 1946 Vancouver Island earthquake that registered 7.3 on the moment magnitude scale the strongest ever recorded on land in Canada.Vancouver Island was the location of the observation of the episodic tremor and slip ETS seismic phenomenon. Ecology Vancouver Island lies in the temperate rainforest biome. On the southern and eastern portions of the island this is characterized by Douglas fir western red cedar arbutus or madrone Garry oak salal Oregon grape and manzanita moreover Vancouver Island is the location where the Douglas fir was first recorded by Archibald Menzies. Vancouver Island is also the location where some of the tallest Douglas fir were recorded. This southeastern portion of the island is the most heavily populated region of Vancouver Island and major area for recreation. The northern western and most of the central portions of the island are home to the coniferous big trees associated with British Columbia 's coast western hemlock western red cedar Pacific silver fir yellow cedar Douglas fir grand fir Sitka spruce and western white pine. It is also characterised by bigleaf maple red alder sword fern and red huckleberry. The fauna of Vancouver Island is similar to that found on the mainland coast with some notable exceptions and additions. For example mountain goats moose coyotes porcupines skunks chipmunks and numerous species of small mammals while plentiful on the mainland are absent from Vancouver Island. Grizzly bears are absent from the island where black bears are prevalent but in 2016 pair of grizzlies were sighted swimming between smaller islands off the coast near Port McNeill. Vancouver Island does support most of Canada 's Roosevelt elk however and several mammal species and subspecies such as the Vancouver Island marmot are unique to the island. Columbian black-tailed deer are plentiful even in suburban areas such as in Greater Victoria as well as the native Douglas squirrels. The Eastern grey squirrel is found in the south and is considered invasive for its voracious appetite and scaring away of the Douglas squirrels. The island has the most concentrated population of cougars in North America. The Vancouver Island wolf subspecies of grey wolf is found only on the north part of the island. Harbour seals and river otters are common. Resident orcas live in two major groups one in the waters of the south island and one in the north while third group of transient orcas roam much farther and avoid the resident orcas. Residents are watched from distance and are numbered with many being named as well. Humpback whales and gray whales are often seen on their migration between Alaskan waters where they feed in the summer and southern waters such as around California and Mexico where they give birth in the winter. The island 's rivers lakes and coastal regions are renowned for their fisheries of trout salmon and steelhead. After near-total extirpation by fur traders in the 18th and 19th centuries sea otters Enhydra lutris were protected by international treaty in 1911. Despite protection the remnant population off Vancouver Island died out with the last sea otter taken near Kyuquot in 1929. From 1969 to 1972 89 sea otters were flown or shipped from Alaska to the west coast of Vancouver Island. This population expanded to over 3,000 as of 2005 and their range on the island 's west coast expanded from Cape Scott in the north to Barkley Sound to the south. Demographics The majority of Vancouver Island 's population lives in the Capital Regional District more specifically in the primate city and provincial capital of Victoria. With population of 397,237 2021 Greater Victoria is the island 's largest population centre and one of its two census metropolitan areas. The island 's second metropolitan area is Nanaimo which has population of 115,459 as of 2021. There are also five census agglomeration areas Alberni Valley Campbell River Comox Valley Cowichan Valley and Oceanside as defined by Statistics Canada. Economy Technology Within the island 's largest city Victoria there is significant IT and technology industry. According to the Victoria Advanced Technology Council website over 800 technology companies operate in the Victoria area with combined annual revenues of 1.95 billion.High-speed internet is delivered to the island by Shaw Communications Telus and various local providers with their own networks. Wireless Internet connections can be found all over the island many free for public use. While the island does generate much of its own power at several hydroelectric stations increased demand required the construction of several high-voltage power cables both HVDC and AC connecting to the Canadian Mainland. Logging Outside of Victoria Vancouver Island 's economy is largely dominated by the forestry industry. Many of the logging operations are for export although historically were for sawn lumber and pulp and paper operations. Recently rotations are much shorter than the historical 80 years. Logging operations involving old-growth forests such as those found in Clayoquot Sound are controversial and due to the Clayoquot protests gained international attention through the efforts of activists and environmental organizations. Another source of controversy all over the island are logging operations occurring in community watersheds. Fishing Fishing plays large role in the lives of many islanders. Commercial fishing vessels operate out of the island 's ports and harbours and coastal fish farms produce many tons of Atlantic salmon yearly. Tourism In recent years the government of British Columbia has engaged in an advertising program to draw more tourists to beach resorts in places such as Tofino and Ucluelet. Sport fishing whale watching hiking scuba diving surfing and skiing are just few things for which tourists visit Vancouver Island. Visitors also come to see Victoria 's 19th-century architecture and the many villages which line the coast such as Cowichan Bay Chemainus and Qualicum Beach. Food products Consumer food products companies also exist in the various cities and towns on Vancouver Island. Bakeries dairies food processing plants breweries wineries of varying size and scope are found all along the island. Some of these organizations have international customer reach. Education Vancouver Island is home to handful of universities several colleges and trade-schools hundreds of public schools and few dozen private schools including Montessori and Waldorf schools. Universities University of Victoria Vancouver Island University formerly Malaspina University-College Royal Roads University Colleges Camosun College North Island College Pacific Horticulture College Public school districts There are 12 school districts on Vancouver Island with several elementary junior high and high schools in each. Three school districts are in the Greater Victoria area and the other eight cover the rest of the island to the north. All public schooling falls under the jurisdiction of the British Columbia Ministry of Education. Private schools Transport Sea Marine transport is very important to Vancouver Island for access to the mainland of British Columbia and Washington. There are no bridges connecting the island to the mainland although the idea of building one has been brought up many times. Major technical issues and cost are the largest barriers to bridge currently though exact public support for the idea is not currently known. The only vehicle access to Vancouver Island is by ferry. BC Ferries Washington State Ferries and Puget Sound Navigation Company Black Ball Transport operate the seven vehicle ferry routes to the island. In the 1860s plan was started to link Vancouver Island to the mainland at Bute Inlet by bridge using Ripple Rock as mid-support for the bridge. This plan continued through the years and caused political opposition to destroying Ripple Rock until it was decided to destroy the rock to improve safety for mariners. ==== BC Ferries ==== Tsawwassen 38 km 24 mi south of Vancouver Swartz Bay 32 km 20 mi north of Victoria Crossing time hour 35 minutes sailings per day year-round with added sailings depending on day and season Tsawwassen Duke Point 13 km 8.1 mi south of Nanaimo Crossing time hours round trips daily varies in winter.Horseshoe Bay 19 km 12 mi northwest of Vancouver Departure Bay km 1.9 mi north of downtown Nanaimo Crossing time hour 35 minutes Sailings every hours with extra sailings during the summer and holidays.Gulf Islands Swartz BayCrossing time 35 minutes- hours depending on island of departure or more trips daily.Powell River ComoxCrossing time hour 20 minutes round trips daily.Port Hardy Prince RupertService daily or on alternate days changes seasonally. ==== Washington State Ferries ==== Anacortes Washington SidneyCrossing time hours not counting stops in the San Juan Islands round trip in March–June and September–January round trips in June–September ==== Black Ball Transport ==== Port Angeles Washington VictoriaCrossing time hour 30 minutes to round trips daily changes seasonally. ==== Passenger-only service ==== In addition there is passenger-only ferry service from the mainland to Vancouver Island Victoria Clipper Seattle Washington Victoria Crossing time hour 45 minutes to round trips dailyIn the past several private operators have run ferries between Nanaimo and Vancouver most recently by HarbourLynx. Despite the operations repeatedly going bankrupt there is still popular interest and ongoing discussion regarding re-establishing service between Nanaimo and Vancouver but no signs that operations are imminent. Rail The Island Corridor Foundation ICF federally registered charity was established in 2006 for the purposes of owning and managing the former Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway Corridor on Vancouver Island. The ICF has established contract with the Southern Railway of Vancouver Island SVI to move all rail freight on the island to and from the mainland. SVI is private commercial rail company and subsidiary of Southern Railway of British Columbia short line rail operator that was purchased by Washington Group International and is now part of AECOM. SVI assumed operating control from RailAmerica in July 2006 and offers general freight service only on the north Nanaimo to South Duncan segment of the Victoria–Courtenay main line called the Victoria Subdivision by the railroad. The Port Alberni branch line called the Port Alberni Subdivision by the railroad has been out of service since late 2001. Passenger service which had been operated by Via Rail under contract was halted in 2011 after it was identified that portion of the line failed to meet operating requirements for passenger service. Since then there have been ongoing efforts to secure funding from various levels of government to complete the necessary repairs but the decision remains open. Western Forest Products operated the Englewood Railway which was Canada 's last logging railway running from Woss to Beaver Cove on the northern end of the island. The former Canadian National Railway line running from Victoria to the Cowichan Valley was abandoned in the late 1980s/early 1990s and the former grade between Victoria and Sooke is now the multi-use Galloping Goose Regional Trail. The BC Forest Discovery Centre has narrow-gauge railway winding around the park and the Alberni Pacific Railway operates tour train during the summer from the restored Railway station in Port Alberni to the McLean 's Mill on former Railway trackage that is now owned by the ICF. Road There is one major north–south highway system on the island which runs along the eastern side. It begins in Victoria as Highway which is part of the Trans-Canada Highway system as far as Nanaimo. There Highway 19 takes over and continues to Port Hardy. The route is patchwork of two- four- and six-lane roadways between Victoria and Port Hardy. The engineering characteristics and traffic control systems of the roadway vary widely from one city or district to the next and include the following variations Trans-Canada Highway Congested heavily signalized four-lane urban core streets with heavy pedestrian activity in Victoria and Duncan. Short four- to six-lane freeways with interchanges just west of Victoria and just south of Nanaimo. mix of two-lane to four-lane winding mountain arterial highway over the Malahat pass. moderate to heavily signalized four-lane divided arterial highway from Mill Bay to Nanaimo interrupted by the Duncan urban-core .Highway 19 moderately signalized expressway called the Nanaimo Parkway bypassing Nanaimo. lightly signalized four-lane divided arterial highway from the Nanaimo to Parksville. stretch of four-lane high-speed freeway/expressway from Parksville to Campbell River. moderate-speed two-lane arterial highway north from Campbell River to Port Hardy.Proposals have been made for mainland to island fixed link for over century. Because of the extreme depth and soft seabed of the Georgia Strait and the potential for seismic activity bridge or tunnel would face monumental engineering safety and environmental challenges at prohibitive cost.Another north–south route is Highway 17 four-lane divided highway that has mix of interchanges and traffic lights. It connects Victoria with the Saanich Peninsula terminating the Vancouver Island portion of its route at the Swartz Bay ferry terminal. The main east–west routes are mostly two-lane but are generally free of the congestion seen on some of the four-lane highways. They comprise the following Highway between Qualicum Beach and Tofino Highway 14 between Greater Victoria and Port Renfrew Highway 18 between Duncan and Lake Cowichan Highway 28 between Campbell River and Gold River and Highway 30 between Port McNeill and Port Alice.Vancouver Island is also well served by secondary routes growing number of which have efficient roundabouts in place of the traffic lights that can back up traffic on the main highway routes. Numerous active and decommissioned logging and forest service roads provide access into the back country. Many communities are served by public and private transit. Greater Victoria is one of the few places in North America where double-decker buses are used in the regular public transit system. Tofino Bus All Island Express serves all major cities on Vancouver Island. Air There are 52 certified airports registered aerodromes and heliports on Vancouver Island. This number includes seven aerodromes and airports in Greater Victoria.Victoria International Airport IATA YYJ ICAO CYYJ is the major airport on Vancouver Island. In 2018 it was the 11th busiest airport in Canada in terms of passenger movements 1,924,385. As of 2020 carriers include Air Canada Express Air Canada Rouge Air North Alaska Airlines Pacific Coastal Airlines WestJet and WestJet Encore. They offer variety of direct flights of short and medium distance including to and from Seattle Calgary Edmonton Vancouver Whitehorse and Toronto. Air Canada Rouge Pacific Coastal Airlines Sunwing Airlines Swoop and WestJet offer seasonal services to several destinations including Mexico. Other land based airports with scheduled services are Campbell River CFB Comox Comox Valley Airport Nanaimo Port Hardy Qualicum Beach and Tofino/Long Beach. In addition there are seven water airports with scheduled services Campbell River Comox Nanaimo Harbour Port Alberni Tofino Harbour Victoria and Victoria Inner Harbour. Much of the floatplane traffic is downtown-to-downtown service between Victoria Inner Harbour Nanaimo Harbour and Vancouver Harbour the primary carriers being Harbour Air Seaplanes Seair Seaplanes and Corilair. Harbour Air also flies to other areas around Vancouver service to Kenmore Air Harbor Seaplane Base on Seattle 's Lake Union is provided by Kenmore Air. Smaller airlines include Tofino Air Pacific Seaplanes and Sunshine Coast Air. These carriers make several daily scheduled flights weather permitting. Helicopter service is provided by Helijet in Victoria and various private operators elsewhere.

Queen Victoria,Victoria Alexandrina Victoria 24 May 1819 22 January 1901 was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death in 1901. Her reign of 63 years and 216 days was longer than that of any previous British monarch and is known as the Victorian era. It was period of industrial political scientific and military change within the United Kingdom and was marked by great expansion of the British Empire.

As result of her seclusion British republicanism temporarily gained strength but in the latter half of her reign her popularity recovered. Her Golden and Diamond jubilees were times of public celebration. Victoria died aged 81 in 1901 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. The last British monarch of the House of Hanover she was succeeded by her son Edward VII of the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Birth and family Victoria 's father was Prince Edward Duke of Kent and Strathearn the fourth son of the reigning King of the United Kingdom George III. Until 1817 the only legitimate grandchild of George III was Edward 's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales who was the daughter of George Prince Regent who would become George IV. Charlotte 's death in 1817 precipitated succession crisis that brought pressure on the Duke of Kent and his unmarried brothers to marry and have children. In 1818 the Duke of Kent married Princess Victoria of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld widowed German princess with two children—Carl 1804–1856 and Feodora 1807–1872 —by her first marriage to Emich Carl 2nd Prince of Leiningen. Her brother Leopold was Princess Charlotte 's widower and later the first king of Belgium. The Duke and Duchess of Kent 's only child Victoria was born at 4:15 a.m. on 24 May 1819 at Kensington Palace in London.Victoria was christened privately by the Archbishop of Canterbury Charles Manners-Sutton on 24 June 1819 in the Cupola Room at Kensington Palace. She was baptised Alexandrina after one of her godparents Tsar Alexander of Russia and Victoria after her mother. Additional names proposed by her parents—Georgina or Georgiana Charlotte and Augusta—were dropped on the instructions of Kent 's eldest brother the Prince Regent.At birth Victoria was fifth in the line of succession after the four eldest sons of George III George Prince Regent later George IV Frederick Duke of York William Duke of Clarence later William IV and Victoria 's father Edward Duke of Kent. The Prince Regent had no surviving children and the Duke of York had no children further both were estranged from their wives who were both past child-bearing age so the two eldest brothers were unlikely to have any further legitimate children. William and Edward married on the same day in 1818 but both of William 's legitimate daughters died as infants. The first of these was Princess Charlotte who was born and died on 27 March 1819 two months before Victoria was born. Victoria 's father died in January 1820 when Victoria was less than year old. week later her grandfather died and was succeeded by his eldest son as George IV. Victoria was then third in line to the throne after Frederick and William. William 's second daughter Princess Elizabeth of Clarence lived for twelve weeks from 10 December 1820 to March 1821 and for that period Victoria was fourth in line.The Duke of York died in 1827 followed by George IV in 1830 the throne passed to their next surviving brother William and Victoria became heir presumptive. The Regency Act 1830 made special provision for Victoria 's mother to act as regent in case William died while Victoria was still minor. King William distrusted the Duchess 's capacity to be regent and in 1836 he declared in her presence that he wanted to live until Victoria 's 18th birthday so that regency could be avoided. Heir presumptive Victoria later described her childhood as rather melancholy. Her mother was extremely protective and Victoria was raised largely isolated from other children under the so-called Kensington System an elaborate set of rules and protocols devised by the Duchess and her ambitious and domineering comptroller Sir John Conroy who was rumoured to be the Duchess 's lover. The system prevented the princess from meeting people whom her mother and Conroy deemed undesirable including most of her father 's family and was designed to render her weak and dependent upon them. The Duchess avoided the court because she was scandalised by the presence of King William 's illegitimate children. Victoria shared bedroom with her mother every night studied with private tutors to regular timetable and spent her play-hours with her dolls and her King Charles Spaniel Dash. Her lessons included French German Italian and Latin but she spoke only English at home. In 1830 the Duchess of Kent and Conroy took Victoria across the centre of England to visit the Malvern Hills stopping at towns and great country houses along the way. Similar journeys to other parts of England and Wales were taken in 1832 1833 1834 and 1835. To the King 's annoyance Victoria was enthusiastically welcomed in each of the stops. William compared the journeys to royal progresses and was concerned that they portrayed Victoria as his rival rather than his heir presumptive. Victoria disliked the trips the constant round of public appearances made her tired and ill and there was little time for her to rest. She objected on the grounds of the King 's disapproval but her mother dismissed his complaints as motivated by jealousy and forced Victoria to continue the tours. At Ramsgate in October 1835 Victoria contracted severe fever which Conroy initially dismissed as childish pretence. While Victoria was ill Conroy and the Duchess unsuccessfully badgered her to make Conroy her private secretary. As teenager Victoria resisted persistent attempts by her mother and Conroy to appoint him to her staff. Once queen she banned him from her presence but he remained in her mother 's household.By 1836 Victoria 's maternal uncle Leopold who had been King of the Belgians since 1831 hoped to marry her to Prince Albert the son of his brother Ernest Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Leopold arranged for Victoria 's mother to invite her Coburg relatives to visit her in May 1836 with the purpose of introducing Victoria to Albert. William IV however disapproved of any match with the Coburgs and instead favoured the suit of Prince Alexander of the Netherlands second son of the Prince of Orange. Victoria was aware of the various matrimonial plans and critically appraised parade of eligible princes. According to her diary she enjoyed Albert 's company from the beginning. After the visit she wrote Albert is extremely handsome his hair is about the same colour as mine his eyes are large and blue and he has beautiful nose and very sweet mouth with fine teeth but the charm of his countenance is his expression which is most delightful. Alexander on the other hand she described as very plain .Victoria wrote to King Leopold whom she considered her best and kindest adviser to thank him for the prospect of great happiness you have contributed to give me in the person of dear Albert .... He possesses every quality that could be desired to render me perfectly happy. He is so sensible so kind and so good and so amiable too. He has besides the most pleasing and delightful exterior and appearance you can possibly see. However at 17 Victoria though interested in Albert was not yet ready to marry. The parties did not undertake formal engagement but assumed that the match would take place in due time. Accession Victoria turned 18 on 24 May 1837 and regency was avoided. Less than month later on 20 June 1837 William IV died at the age of 71 and Victoria became Queen of the United Kingdom. In her diary she wrote was awoke at o'clock by Mamma who told me the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Conyngham were here and wished to see me. got out of bed and went into my sitting-room only in my dressing gown and alone and saw them. Lord Conyngham then acquainted me that my poor Uncle the King was no more and had expired at 12 minutes past this morning and consequently that am Queen. Official documents prepared on the first day of her reign described her as Alexandrina Victoria but the first name was withdrawn at her own wish and not used again.Since 1714 Britain had shared monarch with Hanover in Germany but under Salic law women were excluded from the Hanoverian succession. While Victoria inherited the British throne her father 's unpopular younger brother Ernest Augustus Duke of Cumberland became King of Hanover. He was Victoria 's heir presumptive until she had child. At the time of Victoria 's accession the government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne. He at once became powerful influence on the politically inexperienced monarch who relied on him for advice. Charles Greville supposed that the widowed and childless Melbourne was passionately fond of her as he might be of his daughter if he had one and Victoria probably saw him as father figure. Her coronation took place on 28 June 1838 at Westminster Abbey. Over 400,000 visitors came to London for the celebrations. She became the first sovereign to take up residence at Buckingham Palace and inherited the revenues of the duchies of Lancaster and Cornwall as well as being granted civil list allowance of £385,000 per year. Financially prudent she paid off her father 's debts.At the start of her reign Victoria was popular but her reputation suffered in an 1839 court intrigue when one of her mother 's ladies-in-waiting Lady Flora Hastings developed an abdominal growth that was widely rumoured to be an out-of-wedlock pregnancy by Sir John Conroy. Victoria believed the rumours. She hated Conroy and despised that odious Lady Flora because she had conspired with Conroy and the Duchess of Kent in the Kensington System. At first Lady Flora refused to submit to an intimate medical examination until in mid-February she eventually acquiesced and was found to be virgin. Conroy the Hastings family and the opposition Tories organised press campaign implicating the Queen in the spreading of false rumours about Lady Flora. When Lady Flora died in July the post-mortem revealed large tumour on her liver that had distended her abdomen. At public appearances Victoria was hissed and jeered as Mrs. Melbourne .In 1839 Melbourne resigned after Radicals and Tories both of whom Victoria detested voted against bill to suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned Tory Robert Peel to form new ministry. At the time it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household who were usually his political allies and their spouses. Many of the Queen 's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In what became known as the bedchamber crisis Victoria advised by Melbourne objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen and consequently resigned his commission allowing Melbourne to return to office. Marriage Though Victoria was now queen as an unmarried young woman she was required by social convention to live with her mother despite their differences over the Kensington System and her mother 's continued reliance on Conroy. Her mother was consigned to remote apartment in Buckingham Palace and Victoria often refused to see her. When Victoria complained to Melbourne that her mother 's proximity promised torment for many years Melbourne sympathised but said it could be avoided by marriage which Victoria called schocking sic alternative. Victoria showed interest in Albert 's education for the future role he would have to play as her husband but she resisted attempts to rush her into wedlock.Victoria continued to praise Albert following his second visit in October 1839. Albert and Victoria felt mutual affection and the Queen proposed to him on 15 October 1839 just five days after he had arrived at Windsor. They were married on 10 February 1840 in the Chapel Royal of St James 's Palace London. Victoria was love-struck. She spent the evening after their wedding lying down with headache but wrote ecstatically in her diary NEVER NEVER spent such an evening. MY DEAREST DEAREST DEAR Albert ... his excessive love affection gave me feelings of heavenly love happiness never could have hoped to have felt before. He clasped me in his arms we kissed each other again again. His beauty his sweetness gentleness really how can ever be thankful enough to have such Husband. ... to be called by names of tenderness have never yet heard used to me before was bliss beyond belief. Oh. This was the happiest day of my life. Albert became an important political adviser as well as the Queen 's companion replacing Melbourne as the dominant influential figure in the first half of her life. Victoria 's mother was evicted from the palace to Ingestre House in Belgrave Square. After the death of Victoria 's aunt Princess Augusta in 1840 Victoria 's mother was given both Clarence and Frogmore Houses. Through Albert 's mediation relations between mother and daughter slowly improved. During Victoria 's first pregnancy in 1840 in the first few months of the marriage 18-year-old Edward Oxford attempted to assassinate her while she was riding in carriage with Prince Albert on her way to visit her mother. Oxford fired twice but either both bullets missed or as he later claimed the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason found not guilty by reason of insanity committed to an insane asylum indefinitely and later sent to live in Australia. In the immediate aftermath of the attack Victoria 's popularity soared mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis. Her daughter also named Victoria was born on 21 November 1840. The Queen hated being pregnant viewed breast-feeding with disgust and thought newborn babies were ugly. Nevertheless over the following seventeen years she and Albert had further eight children Albert Edward. 1841 Alice. 1843 Alfred. 1844 Helena. 1846 Louise. 1848 Arthur. 1850 Leopold. 1853 and Beatrice. 1857. The household was largely run by Victoria 's childhood governess Baroness Louise Lehzen from Hanover. Lehzen had been formative influence on Victoria and had supported her against the Kensington System. Albert however thought that Lehzen was incompetent and that her mismanagement threatened his daughter 's health. After furious row between Victoria and Albert over the issue Lehzen was pensioned off in 1842 and Victoria 's close relationship with her ended. Years with Albert On 29 May 1842 Victoria was riding in carriage along The Mall London when John Francis aimed pistol at her but the gun did not fire. The assailant escaped the following day Victoria drove the same route though faster and with greater escort in deliberate attempt to bait Francis into taking second aim and catch him in the act. As expected Francis shot at her but he was seized by plainclothes policemen and convicted of high treason. On July two days after Francis 's death sentence was commuted to transportation for life John William Bean also tried to fire pistol at the Queen but it was loaded only with paper and tobacco and had too little charge. Edward Oxford felt that the attempts were encouraged by his acquittal in 1840. Bean was sentenced to 18 months in jail. In similar attack in 1849 unemployed Irishman William Hamilton fired powder-filled pistol at Victoria 's carriage as it passed along Constitution Hill London. In 1850 the Queen did sustain injury when she was assaulted by possibly insane ex-army officer Robert Pate. As Victoria was riding in carriage Pate struck her with his cane crushing her bonnet and bruising her forehead. Both Hamilton and Pate were sentenced to seven years transportation.Melbourne 's support in the House of Commons weakened through the early years of Victoria 's reign and in the 1841 general election the Whigs were defeated. Peel became prime minister and the ladies of the bedchamber most associated with the Whigs were replaced. In 1845 Ireland was hit by potato blight. In the next four years over million Irish people died and another million emigrated in what became known as the Great Famine. In Ireland Victoria was labelled The Famine Queen. In January 1847 she personally donated £2,000 equivalent to between £178,000 and £6.5 million in 2016 to the British Relief Association more than any other individual famine relief donor and supported the Maynooth Grant to Roman Catholic seminary in Ireland despite Protestant opposition. The story that she donated only £5 in aid to the Irish and on the same day gave the same amount to Battersea Dogs Home was myth generated towards the end of the 19th century.By 1846 Peel 's ministry faced crisis involving the repeal of the Corn Laws. Many Tories—by then known also as Conservatives—were opposed to the repeal but Peel some Tories the free-trade oriented liberal conservative Peelites most Whigs and Victoria supported it. Peel resigned in 1846 after the repeal narrowly passed and was replaced by Lord John Russell. Internationally Victoria took keen interest in the improvement of relations between France and Britain. She made and hosted several visits between the British royal family and the House of Orleans who were related by marriage through the Coburgs. In 1843 and 1845 she and Albert stayed with King Louis Philippe at Château d'Eu in Normandy she was the first British or English monarch to visit French monarch since the meeting of Henry VIII of England and Francis of France on the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520. When Louis Philippe made reciprocal trip in 1844 he became the first French king to visit British sovereign. Louis Philippe was deposed in the revolutions of 1848 and fled to exile in England. At the height of revolutionary scare in the United Kingdom in April 1848 Victoria and her family left London for the greater safety of Osborne House private estate on the Isle of Wight that they had purchased in 1845 and redeveloped. Demonstrations by Chartists and Irish nationalists failed to attract widespread support and the scare died down without any major disturbances. Victoria 's first visit to Ireland in 1849 was public relations success but it had no lasting impact or effect on the growth of Irish nationalism. Russell 's ministry though Whig was not favoured by the Queen. She found particularly offensive the Foreign Secretary Lord Palmerston who often acted without consulting the Cabinet the Prime Minister or the Queen. Victoria complained to Russell that Palmerston sent official dispatches to foreign leaders without her knowledge but Palmerston was retained in office and continued to act on his own initiative despite her repeated remonstrances. It was only in 1851 that Palmerston was removed after he announced the British government 's approval of President Louis-Napoleon Bonaparte 's coup in France without consulting the Prime Minister. The following year President Bonaparte was declared Emperor Napoleon III by which time Russell 's administration had been replaced by short-lived minority government led by Lord Derby. In 1853 Victoria gave birth to her eighth child Leopold with the aid of the new anaesthetic chloroform. She was so impressed by the relief it gave from the pain of childbirth that she used it again in 1857 at the birth of her ninth and final child Beatrice despite opposition from members of the clergy who considered it against biblical teaching and members of the medical profession who thought it dangerous. Victoria may have had postnatal depression after many of her pregnancies. Letters from Albert to Victoria intermittently complain of her loss of self-control. For example about month after Leopold 's birth Albert complained in letter to Victoria about her continuance of hysterics over miserable trifle .In early 1855 the government of Lord Aberdeen who had replaced Derby fell amidst recriminations over the poor management of British troops in the Crimean War. Victoria approached both Derby and Russell to form ministry but neither had sufficient support and Victoria was forced to appoint Palmerston as prime minister.Napoleon III Britain 's closest ally as result of the Crimean War visited London in April 1855 and from 17 to 28 August the same year Victoria and Albert returned the visit. Napoleon III met the couple at Boulogne and accompanied them to Paris. They visited the Exposition Universelle successor to Albert 's 1851 brainchild the Great Exhibition and Napoleon 's tomb at Les Invalides to which his remains had only been returned in 1840 and were guests of honour at 1,200-guest ball at the Palace of Versailles. This marked the first time that reigning British monarch had been to Paris in over 400 years. On 14 January 1858 an Italian refugee from Britain called Felice Orsini attempted to assassinate Napoleon III with bomb made in England. The ensuing diplomatic crisis destabilised the government and Palmerston resigned. Derby was reinstated as prime minister. Victoria and Albert attended the opening of new basin at the French military port of Cherbourg on August 1858 in an attempt by Napoleon III to reassure Britain that his military preparations were directed elsewhere. On her return Victoria wrote to Derby reprimanding him for the poor state of the Royal Navy in comparison to the French Navy. Derby 's ministry did not last long and in June 1859 Victoria recalled Palmerston to office.Eleven days after Orsini 's assassination attempt in France Victoria 's eldest daughter married Prince Frederick William of Prussia in London. They had been betrothed since September 1855 when Princess Victoria was 14 years old the marriage was delayed by the Queen and her husband Albert until the bride was 17. The Queen and Albert hoped that their daughter and son-in-law would be liberalising influence in the enlarging Prussian state. The Queen felt sick at heart to see her daughter leave England for Germany It really makes me shudder she wrote to Princess Victoria in one of her frequent letters when look round to all your sweet happy unconscious sisters and think must give them up too one by one. Almost exactly year later the Princess gave birth to the Queen 's first grandchild Wilhelm who would become the last German Emperor. Widowhood In March 1861 Victoria 's mother died with Victoria at her side. Through reading her mother 's papers Victoria discovered that her mother had loved her deeply she was heart-broken and blamed Conroy and Lehzen for wickedly estranging her from her mother. To relieve his wife during her intense and deep grief Albert took on most of her duties despite being ill himself with chronic stomach trouble. In August Victoria and Albert visited their son Albert Edward Prince of Wales who was attending army manoeuvres near Dublin and spent few days holidaying in Killarney. In November Albert was made aware of gossip that his son had slept with an actress in Ireland. Appalled he travelled to Cambridge where his son was studying to confront him.By the beginning of December Albert was very unwell. He was diagnosed with typhoid fever by William Jenner and died on 14 December 1861. Victoria was devastated. She blamed her husband 's death on worry over the Prince of Wales 's philandering. He had been killed by that dreadful business she said. She entered state of mourning and wore black for the remainder of her life. She avoided public appearances and rarely set foot in London in the following years. Her seclusion earned her the nickname widow of Windsor. Her weight increased through comfort eating which reinforced her aversion to public appearances.Victoria 's self-imposed isolation from the public diminished the popularity of the monarchy and encouraged the growth of the republican movement. She did undertake her official government duties yet chose to remain secluded in her royal residences—Windsor Castle Osborne House and the private estate in Scotland that she and Albert had acquired in 1847 Balmoral Castle. In March 1864 protester stuck notice on the railings of Buckingham Palace that announced these commanding premises to be let or sold in consequence of the late occupant 's declining business. Her uncle Leopold wrote to her advising her to appear in public. She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take drive through London in an open carriage. Through the 1860s Victoria relied increasingly on manservant from Scotland John Brown. Rumours of romantic connection and even secret marriage appeared in print and some referred to the Queen as Mrs. Brown. The story of their relationship was the subject of the 1997 movie Mrs. Brown. painting by Sir Edwin Henry Landseer depicting the Queen with Brown was exhibited at the Royal Academy and Victoria published book Leaves from the Journal of Our Life in the Highlands which featured Brown prominently and in which the Queen praised him highly.Palmerston died in 1865 and after brief ministry led by Russell Derby returned to power. In 1866 Victoria attended the State Opening of Parliament for the first time since Albert 's death. The following year she supported the passing of the Reform Act 1867 which doubled the electorate by extending the franchise to many urban working men though she was not in favour of votes for women. Derby resigned in 1868 to be replaced by Benjamin Disraeli who charmed Victoria. Everyone likes flattery he said and when you come to royalty you should lay it on with trowel. With the phrase we authors Ma'am he complimented her. Disraeli 's ministry only lasted matter of months and at the end of the year his Liberal rival William Ewart Gladstone was appointed prime minister. Victoria found Gladstone 's demeanour far less appealing he spoke to her she is thought to have complained as though she were public meeting rather than woman .In 1870 republican sentiment in Britain fed by the Queen 's seclusion was boosted after the establishment of the Third French Republic. republican rally in Trafalgar Square demanded Victoria 's removal and Radical MPs spoke against her. In August and September 1871 she was seriously ill with an abscess in her arm which Joseph Lister successfully lanced and treated with his new antiseptic carbolic acid spray. In late November 1871 at the height of the republican movement the Prince of Wales contracted typhoid fever the disease that was believed to have killed his father and Victoria was fearful her son would die. As the tenth anniversary of her husband 's death approached her son 's condition grew no better and Victoria 's distress continued. To general rejoicing he recovered. Mother and son attended public parade through London and grand service of thanksgiving in St Paul 's Cathedral on 27 February 1872 and republican feeling subsided.On the last day of February 1872 two days after the thanksgiving service 17-year-old Arthur O'Connor great-nephew of Irish MP Feargus O'Connor waved an unloaded pistol at Victoria 's open carriage just after she had arrived at Buckingham Palace. Brown who was attending the Queen grabbed him and O'Connor was later sentenced to 12 months imprisonment and birching. As result of the incident Victoria 's popularity recovered further. Empress After the Indian Rebellion of 1857 the British East India Company which had ruled much of India was dissolved and Britain 's possessions and protectorates on the Indian subcontinent were formally incorporated into the British Empire. The Queen had relatively balanced view of the conflict and condemned atrocities on both sides. She wrote of her feelings of horror and regret at the result of this bloody civil war and insisted urged on by Albert that an official proclamation announcing the transfer of power from the company to the state should breathe feelings of generosity benevolence and religious toleration. At her behest reference threatening the undermining of native religions and customs was replaced by passage guaranteeing religious freedom. In the 1874 general election Disraeli was returned to power. He passed the Public Worship Regulation Act 1874 which removed Catholic rituals from the Anglican liturgy and which Victoria strongly supported. She preferred short simple services and personally considered herself more aligned with the presbyterian Church of Scotland than the episcopal Church of England. Disraeli also pushed the Royal Titles Act 1876 through Parliament so that Victoria took the title Empress of India from May 1876. The new title was proclaimed at the Delhi Durbar of January 1877.On 14 December 1878 the anniversary of Albert 's death Victoria 's second daughter Alice who had married Louis of Hesse died of diphtheria in Darmstadt. Victoria noted the coincidence of the dates as almost incredible and most mysterious. In May 1879 she became great-grandmother on the birth of Princess Feodora of Saxe-Meiningen and passed her poor old 60th birthday. She felt aged by the loss of my beloved child .Between April 1877 and February 1878 she threatened five times to abdicate while pressuring Disraeli to act against Russia during the Russo-Turkish War but her threats had no impact on the events or their conclusion with the Congress of Berlin. Disraeli 's expansionist foreign policy which Victoria endorsed led to conflicts such as the Anglo-Zulu War and the Second Anglo-Afghan War. If we are to maintain our position as first-rate Power she wrote we must ... be Prepared for attacks and wars somewhere or other CONTINUALLY. Victoria saw the expansion of the British Empire as civilising and benign protecting native peoples from more aggressive powers or cruel rulers It is not in our custom to annexe countries she said unless we are obliged forced to do so. To Victoria 's dismay Disraeli lost the 1880 general election and Gladstone returned as prime minister. When Disraeli died the following year she was blinded by fast falling tears and erected memorial tablet placed by his grateful Sovereign and Friend Victoria R.I. Later years On March 1882 Roderick Maclean disgruntled poet apparently offended by Victoria 's refusal to accept one of his poems shot at the Queen as her carriage left Windsor railway station. Gordon Chesney Wilson and another schoolboy from Eton College struck him with their umbrellas until he was hustled away by policeman. Victoria was outraged when he was found not guilty by reason of insanity but was so pleased by the many expressions of loyalty after the attack that she said it was worth being shot at—to see how much one is loved .On 17 March 1883 Victoria fell down some stairs at Windsor which left her lame until July she never fully recovered and was plagued with rheumatism thereafter. John Brown died 10 days after her accident and to the consternation of her private secretary Sir Henry Ponsonby Victoria began work on eulogistic biography of Brown. Ponsonby and Randall Davidson Dean of Windsor who had both seen early drafts advised Victoria against publication on the grounds that it would stoke the rumours of love affair. The manuscript was destroyed. In early 1884 Victoria did publish More Leaves from Journal of Life in the Highlands sequel to her earlier book which she dedicated to her devoted personal attendant and faithful friend John Brown. On the day after the first anniversary of Brown 's death Victoria was informed by telegram that her youngest son Leopold had died in Cannes. He was the dearest of my dear sons she lamented. The following month Victoria 's youngest child Beatrice met and fell in love with Prince Henry of Battenberg at the wedding of Victoria 's granddaughter Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine to Henry 's brother Prince Louis of Battenberg. Beatrice and Henry planned to marry but Victoria opposed the match at first wishing to keep Beatrice at home to act as her companion. After year she was won around to the marriage by their promise to remain living with and attending her. Victoria was pleased when Gladstone resigned in 1885 after his budget was defeated. She thought his government was the worst have ever had and blamed him for the death of General Gordon at Khartoum. Gladstone was replaced by Lord Salisbury. Salisbury 's government only lasted few months however and Victoria was forced to recall Gladstone whom she referred to as half crazy really in many ways ridiculous old man. Gladstone attempted to pass bill granting Ireland home rule but to Victoria 's glee it was defeated. In the ensuing election Gladstone 's party lost to Salisbury 's and the government switched hands again. Golden Jubilee In 1887 the British Empire celebrated Victoria 's Golden Jubilee. She marked the fiftieth anniversary of her accession on 20 June with banquet to which 50 kings and princes were invited. The following day she participated in procession and attended thanksgiving service in Westminster Abbey. By this time Victoria was once again extremely popular. Two days later on 23 June she engaged two Indian Muslims as waiters one of whom was Abdul Karim. He was soon promoted to Munshi teaching her Urdu and acting as clerk. Her family and retainers were appalled and accused Abdul Karim of spying for the Muslim Patriotic League and biasing the Queen against the Hindus. Equerry Frederick Ponsonby the son of Sir Henry discovered that the Munshi had lied about his parentage and reported to Lord Elgin Viceroy of India the Munshi occupies very much the same position as John Brown used to do. Victoria dismissed their complaints as racial prejudice. Abdul Karim remained in her service until he returned to India with pension on her death.Victoria 's eldest daughter became empress consort of Germany in 1888 but she was widowed little over three months later and Victoria 's eldest grandchild became German Emperor as Wilhelm II. Victoria and Albert 's hopes of liberal Germany would go unfulfilled as Wilhelm was firm believer in autocracy. Victoria thought he had little heart or Zartgefühl tact and ... his conscience intelligence have been completely wharped sic .Gladstone returned to power after the 1892 general election he was 82 years old. Victoria objected when Gladstone proposed appointing the Radical MP Henry Labouchère to the Cabinet so Gladstone agreed not to appoint him. In 1894 Gladstone retired and without consulting the outgoing prime minister Victoria appointed Lord Rosebery as prime minister. His government was weak and the following year Lord Salisbury replaced him. Salisbury remained prime minister for the remainder of Victoria 's reign. Diamond Jubilee On 23 September 1896 Victoria surpassed her grandfather George III as the longest-reigning monarch in British history. The Queen requested that any special celebrations be delayed until 1897 to coincide with her Diamond Jubilee which was made festival of the British Empire at the suggestion of the Colonial Secretary Joseph Chamberlain. The prime ministers of all the self-governing Dominions were invited to London for the festivities. One reason for including the prime ministers of the Dominions and excluding foreign heads of state was to avoid having to invite Victoria 's grandson Wilhelm II of Germany who it was feared might cause trouble at the event.The Queen 's Diamond Jubilee procession on 22 June 1897 followed route six miles long through London and included troops from all over the empire. The procession paused for an open-air service of thanksgiving held outside St Paul 's Cathedral throughout which Victoria sat in her open carriage to avoid her having to climb the steps to enter the building. The celebration was marked by vast crowds of spectators and great outpourings of affection for the 78-year-old Queen. Victoria visited mainland Europe regularly for holidays. In 1889 during stay in Biarritz she became the first reigning monarch from Britain to set foot in Spain when she crossed the border for brief visit. By April 1900 the Boer War was so unpopular in mainland Europe that her annual trip to France seemed inadvisable. Instead the Queen went to Ireland for the first time since 1861 in part to acknowledge the contribution of Irish regiments to the South African war. Death and succession In July 1900 Victoria 's second son Alfred Affie died. Oh God. My poor darling Affie gone too she wrote in her journal. It is horrible year nothing but sadness horrors of one kind another. Following custom she maintained throughout her widowhood Victoria spent the Christmas of 1900 at Osborne House on the Isle of Wight. Rheumatism in her legs had rendered her disabled and her eyesight was clouded by cataracts. Through early January she felt weak and unwell and by mid-January she was drowsy ... dazed and confused. She died on 22 January 1901 at half past six in the evening at the age of 81. Her eldest son Albert Edward succeeded her as Edward VII. Edward and his nephew Wilhelm II were at Victoria 's deathbed. Her favourite pet Pomeranian Turi was laid upon her deathbed as last request. In 1897 Victoria had written instructions for her funeral which was to be military as befitting soldier 's daughter and the head of the army and white instead of black. On 25 January her sons Edward and Arthur and her grandson Wilhelm helped lift her body into the coffin. She was dressed in white dress and her wedding veil. An array of mementos commemorating her extended family friends and servants were laid in the coffin with her at her request by her doctor and dressers. One of Albert 's dressing gowns was placed by her side with plaster cast of his hand while lock of John Brown 's hair along with picture of him was placed in her left hand concealed from the view of the family by carefully positioned bunch of flowers. Items of jewellery placed on Victoria included the wedding ring of John Brown 's mother given to her by Brown in 1883. Her funeral was held on Saturday February in St George 's Chapel Windsor Castle and after two days of lying-in-state she was interred beside Prince Albert in the Royal Mausoleum Frogmore at Windsor Great Park.With reign of 63 years seven months and two days Victoria was the longest-reigning British monarch and the longest-reigning queen regnant in world history until her great-great-granddaughter Elizabeth II surpassed her on September 2015. She was the last monarch of Britain from the House of Hanover her son Edward VII belonged to her husband 's House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Legacy According to one of her biographers Giles St Aubyn Victoria wrote an average of 2,500 words day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death she kept detailed journal which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria 's death her youngest daughter Princess Beatrice was appointed her literary executor. Beatrice transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria 's accession onwards and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice 's edited copy Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before Beatrice destroyed them. Part of Victoria 's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson Hector Bolitho George Earle Buckle Lord Esher Roger Fulford and Richard Hough among others.Victoria was physically unprepossessing—she was stout dowdy and only about five feet 1.5 metres tall—but she succeeded in projecting grand image. She experienced unpopularity during the first years of her widowhood but was well liked during the 1880s and 1890s when she embodied the empire as benevolent matriarchal figure. Only after the release of her diary and letters did the extent of her political influence become known to the wider public. Biographies of Victoria written before much of the primary material became available such as Lytton Strachey 's Queen Victoria of 1921 are now considered out of date. The biographies written by Elizabeth Longford and Cecil Woodham-Smith in 1964 and 1972 respectively are still widely admired. They and others conclude that as person Victoria was emotional obstinate honest and straight-talking. Through Victoria 's reign the gradual establishment of modern constitutional monarchy in Britain continued. Reforms of the voting system increased the power of the House of Commons at the expense of the House of Lords and the monarch. In 1867 Walter Bagehot wrote that the monarch only retained the right to be consulted the right to encourage and the right to warn. As Victoria 's monarchy became more symbolic than political it placed strong emphasis on morality and family values in contrast to the sexual financial and personal scandals that had been associated with previous members of the House of Hanover and which had discredited the monarchy. The concept of the family monarchy with which the burgeoning middle classes could identify was solidified. Descendants and haemophilia Victoria 's links with Europe 's royal families earned her the nickname the grandmother of Europe. Of the 42 grandchildren of Victoria and Albert 34 survived to adulthood. Their living descendants include Charles III of the United Kingdom Harald of Norway Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden Margrethe II of Denmark and Felipe VI of Spain. Victoria 's youngest son Leopold was affected by the blood-clotting disease haemophilia and at least two of her five daughters Alice and Beatrice were carriers. Royal haemophiliacs descended from Victoria included her great-grandsons Alexei Nikolaevich Tsarevich of Russia Alfonso Prince of Asturias and Infante Gonzalo of Spain. The presence of the disease in Victoria 's descendants but not in her ancestors led to modern speculation that her true father was not the Duke of Kent but haemophiliac. There is no documentary evidence of haemophiliac in connection with Victoria 's mother and as male carriers always had the disease even if such man had existed he would have been seriously ill. It is more likely that the mutation arose spontaneously because Victoria 's father was over 50 at the time of her conception and haemophilia arises more frequently in the children of older fathers. Spontaneous mutations account for about third of cases.

While AOSP is free the Android name and logo are trademarks of Google which imposes standards to restrict the use of Android branding by uncertified devices outside their ecosystem.Over 70 percent of smartphones based on Android Open Source Project run Google 's ecosystem which is known simply as Android some with vendor-customized user interfaces and software suites such as TouchWiz and later One UI by Samsung and HTC Sense. Competing ecosystems and forks of AOSP include Fire OS developed by Amazon ColorOS by OPPO OriginOS by Vivo MagicUI by Honor or custom ROMs such as LineageOS. The source code has been used to develop variants of Android on range of other electronics such as game consoles digital cameras portable media players and PCs each with specialized user interface.

Software packages on Android which use the APK format are generally distributed through proprietary application stores like Google Play Store Amazon Appstore including for Windows 11 Samsung Galaxy Store Huawei AppGallery Cafe Bazaar and GetJar or open source platforms like Aptoide or F-Droid. Android has been the best-selling OS worldwide on smartphones since 2011 and on tablets since 2013. As of May 2021 it had over three billion monthly active users the largest installed base of any operating system and as of January 2021 the Google Play Store featured over million apps. Android 13 released on August 15 2022 is the latest version and the recently released Android 12.1/12L includes improvements specific to foldable phones tablets desktop-sized screens and Chromebooks.,"Android is mobile operating system based on modified version of the Linux kernel and other open-source software designed primarily for touchscreen mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. Android is developed by consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance though its most widely used version is primarily developed by Google. It was unveiled in November 2007 with the first commercial Android device the HTC Dream being launched in September 2008.

History Android Inc. was founded in Palo Alto California in October 2003 by Andy Rubin Rich Miner Nick Sears and Chris White. Rubin described the Android project as having tremendous potential in developing smarter mobile devices that are more aware of its owner 's location and preferences. The early intentions of the company were to develop an advanced operating system for digital cameras and this was the basis of its pitch to investors in April 2004. The company then decided that the market for cameras was not large enough for its goals and five months later it had diverted its efforts and was pitching Android as handset operating system that would rival Symbian and Microsoft Windows Mobile.Rubin had difficulty attracting investors early on and Android was facing eviction from its office space. Steve Perlman close friend of Rubin brought him 10,000 in cash in an envelope and shortly thereafter wired an undisclosed amount as seed funding. Perlman refused stake in the company and has stated did it because believed in the thing and wanted to help Andy. In 2005 Rubin tried to negotiate deals with Samsung and HTC. Shortly afterwards Google acquired the company in July of that year for at least 50 million this was Google 's best deal ever according to Google 's then-vice president of corporate development David Lawee in 2010. Android 's key employees including Rubin Miner Sears and White joined Google as part of the acquisition. Not much was known about the secretive Android Inc. at the time with the company having provided few details other than that it was making software for mobile phones. At Google the team led by Rubin developed mobile device platform powered by the Linux kernel. Google marketed the platform to handset makers and carriers on the promise of providing flexible upgradeable system. Google had lined up series of hardware components and software partners and signaled to carriers that it was open to various degrees of cooperation .Speculation about Google 's intention to enter the mobile communications market continued to build through December 2006. An early prototype had close resemblance to BlackBerry phone with no touchscreen and physical QWERTY keyboard but the arrival of 2007 's Apple iPhone meant that Android had to go back to the drawing board. Google later changed its Android specification documents to state that Touchscreens will be supported although the Product was designed with the presence of discrete physical buttons as an assumption therefore touchscreen can not completely replace physical buttons. By 2008 both Nokia and BlackBerry announced touch-based smartphones to rival the iPhone 3G and Android 's focus eventually switched to just touchscreens. The first commercially available smartphone running Android was the HTC Dream also known as T-Mobile G1 announced on September 23 2008. On November 2007 the Open Handset Alliance consortium of technology companies including Google device manufacturers such as HTC Motorola and Samsung wireless carriers such as Sprint and T-Mobile and chipset makers such as Qualcomm and Texas Instruments unveiled itself with goal to develop the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices. Within year the Open Handset Alliance faced two other open source competitors the Symbian Foundation and the LiMo Foundation the latter also developing Linux-based mobile operating system like Google. In September 2007 InformationWeek covered an Evalueserve study reporting that Google had filed several patent applications in the area of mobile telephony.Since 2008 Android has seen numerous updates which have incrementally improved the operating system adding new features and fixing bugs in previous releases. Each major release is named in alphabetical order after dessert or sugary treat with the first few Android versions being called Cupcake Donut Eclair and Froyo in that order. During its announcement of Android KitKat in 2013 Google explained that Since these devices make our lives so sweet each Android version is named after dessert although Google spokesperson told CNN in an interview that It 's kind of like an internal team thing and we prefer to be little bit—how should say—a bit inscrutable in the matter 'll say .In 2010 Google launched its Nexus series of devices lineup in which Google partnered with different device manufacturers to produce new devices and introduce new Android versions. The series was described as having played pivotal role in Android 's history by introducing new software iterations and hardware standards across the board and became known for its bloat-free software with timely ... updates. At its developer conference in May 2013 Google announced special version of the Samsung Galaxy S4 where instead of using Samsung 's own Android customization the phone ran stock Android and was promised to receive new system updates fast. The device would become the start of the Google Play edition program and was followed by other devices including the HTC One Google Play edition and Moto Google Play edition. In 2015 Ars Technica wrote that Earlier this week the last of the Google Play edition Android phones in Google 's online storefront were listed as no longer available for sale and that Now they 're all gone and it looks whole lot like the program has wrapped up. From 2008 to 2013 Hugo Barra served as product spokesperson representing Android at press conferences and Google I/O Google 's annual developer-focused conference. He left Google in August 2013 to join Chinese phone maker Xiaomi. Less than six months earlier Google 's then-CEO Larry Page announced in blog post that Andy Rubin had moved from the Android division to take on new projects at Google and that Sundar Pichai would become the new Android lead. Pichai himself would eventually switch positions becoming the new CEO of Google in August 2015 following the company 's restructure into the Alphabet conglomerate making Hiroshi Lockheimer the new head of Android.On Android 4.4 Kit Kat shared writing access to MicroSD memory cards has been locked for user-installed applications to which only the dedicated directories with respective package names located inside Android/data/ remained writeable. Writing access has been reinstated with Android Lollipop through the backwards-incompatible Google Storage Access Framework interface.In June 2014 Google announced Android One set of hardware reference models that would allow device makers to easily create high-quality phones at low costs designed for consumers in developing countries. In September Google announced the first set of Android One phones for release in India. However Recode reported in June 2015 that the project was disappointment citing reluctant consumers and manufacturing partners and misfires from the search company that has never quite cracked hardware. Plans to relaunch Android One surfaced in August 2015 with Africa announced as the next location for the program week later. report from The Information in January 2017 stated that Google is expanding its low-cost Android One program into the United States although The Verge notes that the company will presumably not produce the actual devices itself. Google introduced the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in October 2016 marketed as being the first phones made by Google and exclusively featured certain software features such as the Google Assistant before wider rollout. The Pixel phones replaced the Nexus series with new generation of Pixel phones launched in October 2017.In May 2019 the operating system became entangled in the trade war between China and the United States involving Huawei which like many other tech firms had become dependent on access to the Android platform. In the summer of 2019 Huawei announced it would create an alternative operating system to Android known as Harmony OS and has filed for intellectual property rights across major global markets. Under such sanctions Huawei has long-term plans to replace Android in 2022 with the new operating system as Harmony OS was originally designed for internet of things devices rather than for smartphones and tablets.On August 22 2019 it was announced that Android would officially be branded as Android 10 ending the historic practice of naming major versions after desserts. Google stated that these names were not inclusive to international users due either to the aforementioned foods not being internationally known or being difficult to pronounce in some languages. On the same day Android Police reported that Google had commissioned statue of giant number 10 to be installed in the lobby of the developers new office. Android 10 was released on September 2019 to Google Pixel phones first. In late 2021 some users reported that they were unable to dial emergency services. The problem was caused by combination of bugs in Android and in the Microsoft Teams app both companies released updates addressing the issue. Features Interface Android 's default user interface is mainly based on direct manipulation using touch inputs that loosely correspond to real-world actions like swiping tapping pinching and reverse pinching to manipulate on-screen objects along with virtual keyboard. Game controllers and full-size physical keyboards are supported via Bluetooth or USB. The response to user input is designed to be immediate and provides fluid touch interface often using the vibration capabilities of the device to provide haptic feedback to the user. Internal hardware such as accelerometers gyroscopes and proximity sensors are used by some applications to respond to additional user actions for example adjusting the screen from portrait to landscape depending on how the device is oriented or allowing the user to steer vehicle in racing game by rotating the device simulating control of steering wheel. ==== Home screen ==== Android devices boot to the home screen the primary navigation and information hub on Android devices analogous to the desktop found on personal computers. Android home screens are typically made up of app icons and widgets app icons launch the associated app whereas widgets display live auto-updating content such as weather forecast the user 's email inbox or news ticker directly on the home screen. home screen may be made up of several pages between which the user can swipe back and forth. Third-party apps available on Google Play and other app stores can extensively re-theme the home screen and even mimic the look of other operating systems such as Windows Phone. Most manufacturers customize the look and features of their Android devices to differentiate themselves from their competitors. ==== Status bar ==== Along the top of the screen is status bar showing information about the device and its connectivity. This status bar can be pulled swiped down from to reveal notification screen where apps display important information or updates as well as quick access to system controls and toggles such as display brightness connectivity settings WiFi Bluetooth cellular data audio mode and flashlight. Vendors may implement extended settings such as the ability to adjust the flashlight brightness. ==== Notifications ==== Notifications are short timely and relevant information about your app when it 's not in use and when tapped users are directed to screen inside the app relating to the notification. Beginning with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean expandable notifications allow the user to tap an icon on the notification in order for it to expand and display more information and possible app actions right from the notification. ==== App lists ==== An All Apps screen lists all installed applications with the ability for users to drag an app from the list onto the home screen. The app list may be accessed using gesture or button depending on the Android version. Recents screen also known as Overview lets users switch between recently used apps.The recent list may appear side-by-side or overlapping depending on the Android version and manufacturer. ==== Navigation buttons ==== Many early Android OS smartphones were equipped with dedicated search button for quick access to web search engine and individual apps internal search feature. More recent devices typically allow the former through long press or swipe away from the home button.The dedicated option key also known as menu key and its on-screen simulation is no longer supported since Android version 10. Google recommends mobile application developers to locate menus within the user interface. On more recent phones its place is occupied by task key used to access the list of recently used apps when actuated. Depending on device its long press may simulate menu button press or engage split screen view the latter of which is the default behaviour since stock Android version. ==== Split-screen view ==== Native support for split screen view has been added in stock Android version 7.0 Nougat.The earliest vendor-customized Android-based smartphones known to have featured split-screen view mode are the 2012 Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note the former of which received this feature with the premium suite upgrade delivered in TouchWiz with Android 4.1 Jelly Bean. ==== Charging while powered off ==== When connecting or disconnecting charging power and when shortly actuating the power button or home button all while the device is powered off visual battery meter whose appearance varies among vendors appears on the screen allowing the user to quickly assess the charge status of powered-off without having to boot it up first. Some display the battery percentage. Applications Many to almost all Android devices come with preinstalled Google apps including Gmail Google Maps Google Chrome YouTube Google Play Music Google Play Movies TV and many more. Applications apps which extend the functionality of devices and must be 64-bit are written using the Android software development kit SDK and often Kotlin programming language which replaced Java as Google 's preferred language for Android app development in May 2019 and was originally announced in May 2017. Java is still supported originally the only option for user-space programs and is often mixed with Kotlin as is C++. Java or other JVM languages such as Kotlin may be combined with C/C++ together with choice of non-default runtimes that allow better C++ support. The Go programming language is also supported although with limited set of application programming interfaces API .The SDK includes comprehensive set of development tools including debugger software libraries handset emulator based on QEMU documentation sample code and tutorials. Initially Google 's supported integrated development environment IDE was Eclipse using the Android Development Tools ADT plugin in December 2014 Google released Android Studio based on IntelliJ IDEA as its primary IDE for Android application development. Other development tools are available including native development kit NDK for applications or extensions in or C++ Google App Inventor visual environment for novice programmers and various cross platform mobile web applications frameworks. In January 2014 Google unveiled framework based on Apache Cordova for porting Chrome HTML web applications to Android wrapped in native application shell. Additionally Firebase was acquired by Google in 2014 that provides helpful tools for app and web developers.Android has growing selection of third-party applications which can be acquired by users by downloading and installing the application 's APK Android application package file or by downloading them using an application store program that allows users to install update and remove applications from their devices. Google Play Store is the primary application store installed on Android devices that comply with Google 's compatibility requirements and license the Google Mobile Services software. Google Play Store allows users to browse download and update applications published by Google and third-party developers as of January 2021 there are more than three million applications available for Android in Play Store. As of July 2013 50 billion application installations had been performed. Some carriers offer direct carrier billing for Google Play application purchases where the cost of the application is added to the user 's monthly bill. As of May 2017 there are over one billion active users month for Gmail Android Chrome Google Play and Maps. Due to the open nature of Android number of third-party application marketplaces also exist for Android either to provide substitute for devices that are not allowed to ship with Google Play Store provide applications that can not be offered on Google Play Store due to policy violations or for other reasons. Examples of these third-party stores have included the Amazon Appstore GetJar and SlideMe. F-Droid another alternative marketplace seeks to only provide applications that are distributed under free and open source licenses.In October 2020 Google removed several Android applications from Play Store as they were identified breaching its data collection rules. The firm was informed by International Digital Accountability Council IDAC that apps for children like Number Coloring Princess Salon and Cats Cosplay with collective downloads of 20 million were violating Google 's policies.At the Windows 11 announcement event in June 2021 Microsoft showcased the new Windows Subsystem for Android WSA that will enable support for the Android Open Source Project AOSP and will allow users to run Android apps on their Windows desktop. Storage The storage of Android devices can be expanded using secondary devices such as SD cards. Android recognizes two types of secondary storage portable storage which is used by default and adoptable storage. Portable storage is treated as an external storage device. Adoptable storage introduced on Android 6.0 allows the internal storage of the device to be spanned with the SD card treating it as an extension of the internal storage. This has the disadvantage of preventing the memory card from being used with another device unless it is reformatted.Android 4.4 introduced the Storage Access Framework SAF set of APIs for accessing files on the device 's filesystem. As of Android 11 Android has required apps to conform to data privacy policy known as scoped storage under which apps may only automatically have access to certain directories such as those for pictures music and video and app-specific directories they have created themselves. Apps are required to use the SAF to access any other part of the filesystem. Memory management Since Android devices are usually battery-powered Android is designed to manage processes to keep power consumption at minimum. When an application is not in use the system suspends its operation so that while available for immediate use rather than closed it does not use battery power or CPU resources. Android manages the applications stored in memory automatically when memory is low the system will begin invisibly and automatically closing inactive processes starting with those that have been inactive for the longest amount of time. Lifehacker reported in 2011 that third-party task-killer applications were doing more harm than good. Developer options Some settings for use by developers for debugging and power users are located in Developer options sub menu such as the ability to highlight updating parts of the display show an overlay with the current status of the touch screen show touching spots for possible use in screencasting notify the user of unresponsive background processes with the option to end them Show all ANRs i.e. App 's Not Responding prevent Bluetooth audio client from controlling the system volume Disable absolute volume and adjust the duration of transition animations or deactivate them completely to speed up navigation.Developer options are initially hidden since Android 4.2 Jelly Bean but can be enabled by actuating the operating system 's build number in the device information seven times. Hiding developers options again requires deleting user data for the Settings app possibly resetting some other preferences. Hardware The main hardware platform for Android is ARM the ARMv7 and ARMv8-A architectures with x86 and x86-64 architectures also officially supported in later versions of Android. The unofficial Android-x86 project provided support for x86 architectures ahead of the official support. Since 2012 Android devices with Intel processors began to appear including phones and tablets. While gaining support for 64-bit platforms Android was first made to run on 64-bit x86 and then on ARM64. An unofficial experimental port of the operating system to the RISC-V architecture was released in 2021.Requirements for the minimum amount of RAM for devices running Android 7.1 range from in practice GB for best hardware down to GB for the most common screen. Android supports all versions of OpenGL ES and Vulkan and version 1.1 available for some devices. Android devices incorporate many optional hardware components including still or video cameras GPS orientation sensors dedicated gaming controls accelerometers gyroscopes barometers magnetometers proximity sensors pressure sensors thermometers and touchscreens. Some hardware components are not required but became standard in certain classes of devices such as smartphones and additional requirements apply if they are present. Some other hardware was initially required but those requirements have been relaxed or eliminated altogether. For example as Android was developed initially as phone OS hardware such as microphones were required while over time the phone function became optional. Android used to require an autofocus camera which was relaxed to fixed-focus camera if present at all since the camera was dropped as requirement entirely when Android started to be used on set-top boxes. In addition to running on smartphones and tablets several vendors run Android natively on regular PC hardware with keyboard and mouse. In addition to their availability on commercially available hardware similar PC hardware-friendly versions of Android are freely available from the Android-x86 project including customized Android 4.4. Using the Android emulator that is part of the Android SDK or third-party emulators Android can also run non-natively on x86 architectures. Chinese companies are building PC and mobile operating system based on Android to compete directly with Microsoft Windows and Google Android. The Chinese Academy of Engineering noted that more than dozen companies were customizing Android following Chinese ban on the use of Windows on government PCs. Development Android is developed by Google until the latest changes and updates are ready to be released at which point the source code is made available to the Android Open Source Project AOSP an open source initiative led by Google.The first source code release happened as part of the initial release in 2007. All releases are under the Apache License.The AOSP code can be found with minimal modifications on select devices mainly the former Nexus and current Android One series of devices. However most original equipment manufacturers OEMs customize the source code to run on their hardware.Android 's source code does not contain the device drivers often proprietary that are needed for certain hardware components and does not contain the source code of Google Play Services which many apps depend on. As result most Android devices including Google 's own ship with combination of free and open source and proprietary software with the software required for accessing Google services falling into the latter category. In response to this there are some projects that build complete operating systems based on AOSP as free software the first being CyanogenMod see section Open-source community below. Update schedule Google provides annual Android releases both for factory installation in new devices and for over-the-air updates to existing devices. The latest major release is Android 13. The extensive variation of hardware in Android devices has caused significant delays for software upgrades and security patches. Each upgrade has had to be specifically tailored time- and resource-consuming process. Except for devices within the Google Nexus and Pixel brands updates have often arrived months after the release of the new version or not at all. Manufacturers often prioritize their newest devices and leave old ones behind. Additional delays can be introduced by wireless carriers who after receiving updates from manufacturers further customize Android to their needs and conduct extensive testing on their networks before sending out the upgrade. There are also situations in which upgrades are impossible due to manufacturer not updating necessary drivers.The lack of after-sale support from manufacturers and carriers has been widely criticized by consumer groups and the technology media. Some commentators have noted that the industry has financial incentive not to upgrade their devices as the lack of updates for existing devices fuels the purchase of newer ones an attitude described as insulting. The Guardian complained that the method of distribution for updates is complicated only because manufacturers and carriers have designed it that way. In 2011 Google partnered with number of industry players to announce an Android Update Alliance pledging to deliver timely updates for every device for 18 months after its release however there has not been another official word about that alliance since its announcement.In 2012 Google began de-coupling certain aspects of the operating system particularly its central applications so they could be updated through the Google Play store independently of the OS. One of those components Google Play Services is closed-source system-level process providing APIs for Google services installed automatically on nearly all devices running Android 2.2 Froyo and higher. With these changes Google can add new system functions and update apps without having to distribute an upgrade to the operating system itself. As result Android 4.2 and 4.3 Jelly Bean contained relatively fewer user-facing changes focusing more on minor changes and platform improvements.HTC 's then-executive Jason Mackenzie called monthly security updates unrealistic in 2015 and Google was trying to persuade carriers to exclude security patches from the full testing procedures. In May 2016 Bloomberg Businessweek reported that Google was making efforts to keep Android more up-to-date including accelerated rates of security updates rolling out technological workarounds reducing requirements for phone testing and ranking phone makers in an attempt to shame them into better behavior. As stated by Bloomberg As smartphones get more capable complex and hackable having the latest software work closely with the hardware is increasingly important. Hiroshi Lockheimer the Android lead admitted that It 's not an ideal situation further commenting that the lack of updates is the weakest link on security on Android. Wireless carriers were described in the report as the most challenging discussions due to their slow approval time while testing on their networks despite some carriers including Verizon Wireless and Sprint Corporation already shortening their approval times. In further effort for persuasion Google shared list of top phone makers measured by updated devices with its Android partners and is considering making the list public. Mike Chan co-founder of phone maker Nextbit and former Android developer said that The best way to solve this problem is massive re-architecture of the operating system or Google could invest in training manufacturers and carriers 'to be good Android citizens .In May 2017 with the announcement of Android 8.0 Google introduced Project Treble major re-architect of the Android OS framework designed to make it easier faster and less costly for manufacturers to update devices to newer versions of Android. Project Treble separates the vendor implementation device-specific lower-level software written by silicon manufacturers from the Android OS framework via new vendor interface. In Android 7.0 and earlier no formal vendor interface exists so device makers must update large portions of the Android code to move device to newer version of the operating system. With Treble the new stable vendor interface provides access to the hardware-specific parts of Android enabling device makers to deliver new Android releases simply by updating the Android OS framework without any additional work required from the silicon manufacturers. In September 2017 Google 's Project Treble team revealed that as part of their efforts to improve the security lifecycle of Android devices Google had managed to get the Linux Foundation to agree to extend the support lifecycle of the Linux Long-Term Support LTS kernel branch from the years that it has historically lasted to years for future versions of the LTS kernel starting with Linux kernel 4.4.In May 2019 with the announcement of Android 10 Google introduced Project Mainline to simplify and expedite delivery of updates to the Android ecosystem. Project Mainline enables updates to core OS components through the Google Play Store. As result important security and performance improvements that previously needed to be part of full OS updates can be downloaded and installed as easily as an app update.Google reported rolling out new amendments in Android 12 aimed at making the use of third-party application stores easier. This announcement rectified the concerns reported regarding the development of Android apps including fight over an alternative in-app payment system and difficulties faced by businesses moving online because of COVID-19. Linux kernel Android 's kernel is based on the Linux kernel 's long-term support LTS branches. As of 2023 Android uses versions 4.14 4.19 5.4 5.10 or 5.15 of the Linux kernel and since modified Linux kernels is used Android names like android13-5.15 or android-4.19-stable are used. The actual kernel depends on the individual device.Android 's variant of the Linux kernel has further architectural changes that are implemented by Google outside the typical Linux kernel development cycle such as the inclusion of components like device trees ashmem ION and different out of memory OOM handling. Certain features that Google contributed back to the Linux kernel notably power management feature called wakelocks were initially rejected by mainline kernel developers partly because they felt that Google did not show any intent to maintain its own code. Google announced in April 2010 that they would hire two employees to work with the Linux kernel community but Greg Kroah-Hartman the current Linux kernel maintainer for the stable branch said in December 2010 that he was concerned that Google was no longer trying to get their code changes included in mainstream Linux. Google engineer Patrick Brady once stated in the company 's developer conference that Android is not Linux with Computerworld adding that Let me make it simple for you without Linux there is no Android. Ars Technica wrote that Although Android is built on top of the Linux kernel the platform has very little in common with the conventional desktop Linux stack .In August 2011 Linus Torvalds said that eventually Android and Linux would come back to common kernel but it will probably not be for four to five years. that has n't happened yet while some code has been upstreamed not all of it has so modified kernels keep being used. In December 2011 Greg Kroah-Hartman announced the start of Android Mainlining Project which aims to put some Android drivers patches and features back into the Linux kernel starting in Linux 3.3. Linux included the autosleep and wakelocks capabilities in the 3.5 kernel after many previous attempts at merger. The interfaces are the same but the upstream Linux implementation allows for two different suspend modes to memory the traditional suspend that Android uses and to disk hibernate as it is known on the desktop. Google maintains public code repository that contains their experimental work to re-base Android off the latest stable Linux versions.Android is Linux distribution according to the Linux Foundation Google 's open-source chief Chris DiBona and several journalists. Others such as Google engineer Patrick Brady say that Android is not Linux in the traditional Unix-like Linux distribution sense Android does not include the GNU Library it uses Bionic as an alternative library and some other components typically found in Linux distributions.With the release of Android Oreo in 2017 Google began to require that devices shipped with new SoCs had Linux kernel version 4.4 or newer for security reasons. Existing devices upgraded to Oreo and new products launched with older SoCs were exempt from this rule. Rooting The flash storage on Android devices is split into several partitions such as /system/ for the operating system itself and /data/ for user data and application installations.In contrast to typical desktop Linux distributions Android device owners are not given root access to the operating system and sensitive partitions such as /system/ are read-only. However root access can be obtained by exploiting security flaws in Android which is used frequently by the open-source community to enhance the capabilities and customizability of their devices but also by malicious parties to install viruses and malware. Root access can also be obtained by unlocking the bootloader via the OEM Unlocking option on certain devices including most Google Pixel and OnePlus models. The unlocking process resets the system to factory state erasing all user data. Software stack On top of the Linux kernel there are the middleware libraries and APIs written in and application software running on an application framework which includes Java-compatible libraries. Development of the Linux kernel continues independently of Android 's other source code projects. Android uses Android Runtime ART as its runtime environment introduced in version 4.4 which uses ahead-of-time AOT compilation to entirely compile the application bytecode into machine code upon the installation of an application. In Android 4.4 ART was an experimental feature and not enabled by default it became the only runtime option in the next major version of Android 5.0. In versions no longer supported until version 5.0 when ART took over Android previously used Dalvik as process virtual machine with trace-based just-in-time JIT compilation to run Dalvik dex-code Dalvik Executable which is usually translated from the Java bytecode. Following the trace-based JIT principle in addition to interpreting the majority of application code Dalvik performs the compilation and native execution of select frequently executed code segments traces each time an application is launched. For its Java library the Android platform uses subset of the now discontinued Apache Harmony project. In December 2015 Google announced that the next version of Android would switch to Java implementation based on the OpenJDK project.Android 's standard library Bionic was developed by Google specifically for Android as derivation of the BSD 's standard library code. Bionic itself has been designed with several major features specific to the Linux kernel. The main benefits of using Bionic instead of the GNU Library glibc or uClibc are its smaller runtime footprint and optimization for low-frequency CPUs. At the same time Bionic is licensed under the terms of the BSD licence which Google finds more suitable for the Android 's overall licensing model.Aiming for different licensing model toward the end of 2012 Google switched the Bluetooth stack in Android from the GPL-licensed BlueZ to the Apache-licensed BlueDroid. new Bluetooth stack called Gabeldorsche was developed to try to fix the bugs in the BlueDroid implementation.Android does not have native Window System by default nor does it support the full set of standard GNU libraries. This made it difficult to port existing Linux applications or libraries to Android until version r5 of the Android Native Development Kit brought support for applications written completely in or C++. Libraries written in may also be used in applications by injection of small shim and usage of the JNI.In current versions of Android Toybox collection of command-line utilities mostly for use by apps as Android does not provide command-line interface by default is used since the release of Marshmallow replacing similar Toolbox collection found in previous Android versions.Android has another operating system Trusty OS within it as part of Trusty software components supporting Trusted Execution Environment TEE on mobile devices.

Open-source community Android 's source code is released by Google under an open source license and its open nature has encouraged large community of developers and enthusiasts to use the open-source code as foundation for community-driven projects which deliver updates to older devices add new features for advanced users or bring Android to devices originally shipped with other operating systems. These community-developed releases often bring new features and updates to devices faster than through the official manufacturer/carrier channels with comparable level of quality provide continued support for older devices that no longer receive official updates or bring Android to devices that were officially released running other operating systems such as the HP TouchPad. Community releases often come pre-rooted and contain modifications not provided by the original vendor such as the ability to overclock or over/undervolt the device 's processor. CyanogenMod was the most widely used community firmware now discontinued and succeeded by LineageOS.There are as of August 2019 handful of notable custom Android distributions ROMs of the latest Android version 9.0 Pie which was released publicly in August 2018. See List of custom Android distributions. Historically device manufacturers and mobile carriers have typically been unsupportive of third-party firmware development. Manufacturers express concern about improper functioning of devices running unofficial software and the support costs resulting from this. Moreover modified firmware such as CyanogenMod sometimes offer features such as tethering for which carriers would otherwise charge premium. As result technical obstacles including locked bootloaders and restricted access to root permissions are common in many devices. However as community-developed software has grown more popular and following statement by the Librarian of Congress in the United States that permits the jailbreaking of mobile devices manufacturers and carriers have softened their position regarding third party development with some including HTC Motorola Samsung and Sony providing support and encouraging development. As result of this over time the need to circumvent hardware restrictions to install unofficial firmware has lessened as an increasing number of devices are shipped with unlocked or unlockable bootloaders similar to Nexus series of phones although usually requiring that users waive their devices warranties to do so. However despite manufacturer acceptance some carriers in the US still require that phones are locked down frustrating developers and customers. Device codenames Internally Android identifies each supported device by its device codename short string which may or may not be similar to the model name used in marketing the device. For example the device codename of the Pixel smartphone is sailfish. The device codename is usually not visible to the end user but is important for determining compatibility with modified Android versions. It is sometimes also mentioned in articles discussing device because it allows to distinguish different hardware variants of device even if the manufacturer offers them under the same name. The device codename is available to running applications under android.os.Build.DEVICE. Security and privacy In 2020 Google launched the Android Partner Vulnerability Initiative to improve the security of Android. They also formed an Android security team. Common security threats Research from security company Trend Micro lists premium service abuse as the most common type of Android malware where text messages are sent from infected phones to premium-rate telephone numbers without the consent or even knowledge of the user. Other malware displays unwanted and intrusive advertisements on the device or sends personal information to unauthorised third parties. Security threats on Android are reportedly growing exponentially however Google engineers have argued that the malware and virus threat on Android is being exaggerated by security companies for commercial reasons and have accused the security industry of playing on fears to sell virus protection software to users. Google maintains that dangerous malware is actually extremely rare and survey conducted by F-Secure showed that only 0.5 of Android malware reported had come from the Google Play store.In 2021 journalists and researchers reported the discovery of spyware called Pegasus developed and distributed by private company which can and has been used to infect both iOS and Android smartphones often partly via use of 0-day exploits without the need for any user-interaction or significant clues to the user and then be used to exfiltrate data track user locations capture film through its camera and activate the microphone at any time. Analysis of data traffic by popular smartphones running variants of Android found substantial by-default data collection and sharing with no opt-out by this pre-installed software. Both of these issues are not addressed or can not be addressed by security patches. ==== Scope of surveillance by public institutions ==== As part of the broader 2013 mass surveillance disclosures it was revealed in September 2013 that the American and British intelligence agencies the National Security Agency NSA and Government Communications Headquarters GCHQ respectively have access to the user data on iPhone BlackBerry and Android devices. They are reportedly able to read almost all smartphone information including SMS location emails and notes. In January 2014 further reports revealed the intelligence agencies capabilities to intercept the personal information transmitted across the Internet by social networks and other popular applications such as Angry Birds which collect personal information of their users for advertising and other commercial reasons. GCHQ has according to The Guardian wiki-style guide of different apps and advertising networks and the different data that can be siphoned from each. Later that week the Finnish Angry Birds developer Rovio announced that it was reconsidering its relationships with its advertising platforms in the light of these revelations and called upon the wider industry to do the same.The documents revealed further effort by the intelligence agencies to intercept Google Maps searches and queries submitted from Android and other smartphones to collect location information in bulk. The NSA and GCHQ insist their activities comply with all relevant domestic and international laws although the Guardian stated the latest disclosures could also add to mounting public concern about how the technology sector collects and uses information especially for those outside the US who enjoy fewer privacy protections than Americans. Leaked documents published by WikiLeaks codenamed Vault and dated from 2013 to 2016 detail the capabilities of the Central Intelligence Agency CIA to perform electronic surveillance and cyber warfare including the ability to compromise the operating systems of most smartphones including Android. ==== Security patches ==== In August 2015 Google announced that devices in the Google Nexus series would begin to receive monthly security patches. Google also wrote that Nexus devices will continue to receive major updates for at least two years and security patches for the longer of three years from initial availability or 18 months from last sale of the device via the Google Store. The following October researchers at the University of Cambridge concluded that 87.7 of Android phones in use had known but unpatched security vulnerabilities due to lack of updates and support. Ron Amadeo of Ars Technica wrote also in August 2015 that Android was originally designed above all else to be widely adopted. Google was starting from scratch with zero percent market share so it was happy to give up control and give everyone seat at the table in exchange for adoption. ... Now though Android has around 75–80 percent of the worldwide smartphone market—making it not just the world 's most popular mobile operating system but arguably the most popular operating system period. As such security has become big issue. Android still uses software update chain-of-command designed back when the Android ecosystem had zero devices to update and it just does n't work. Following news of Google 's monthly schedule some manufacturers including Samsung and LG promised to issue monthly security updates but as noted by Jerry Hildenbrand in Android Central in February 2016 instead we got few updates on specific versions of small handful of models. And bunch of broken promises .In March 2017 post on Google 's Security Blog Android security leads Adrian Ludwig and Mel Miller wrote that More than 735 million devices from 200+ manufacturers received platform security update in 2016 and that Our carrier and hardware partners helped expand deployment of these updates releasing updates for over half of the top 50 devices worldwide in the last quarter of 2016. They also wrote that About half of devices in use at the end of 2016 had not received platform security update in the previous year stating that their work would continue to focus on streamlining the security updates program for easier deployment by manufacturers. Furthermore in comment to TechCrunch Ludwig stated that the wait time for security updates had been reduced from six to nine weeks down to just few days with 78 of flagship devices in North America being up-to-date on security at the end of 2016.Patches to bugs found in the core operating system often do not reach users of older and lower-priced devices. However the open-source nature of Android allows security contractors to take existing devices and adapt them for highly secure uses. For example Samsung has worked with General Dynamics through their Open Kernel Labs acquisition to rebuild Jelly Bean on top of their hardened microvisor for the Knox project. Location-tracking Android smartphones have the ability to report the location of Wi-Fi access points encountered as phone users move around to build databases containing the physical locations of hundreds of millions of such access points. These databases form electronic maps to locate smartphones allowing them to run apps like Foursquare Google Latitude Facebook Places and to deliver location-based ads. Third party monitoring software such as TaintDroid an academic research-funded project can in some cases detect when personal information is being sent from applications to remote servers. Further notable exploits In 2018 Norwegian security firm Promon has unearthed serious Android security hole which can be exploited to steal login credentials access messages and track location which could be found in all versions of Android including Android 10. The vulnerability came by exploiting bug in the multitasking system enabling malicious app to overlay legitimate apps with fake login screens that users are not aware of when handing in security credentials. Users can also be tricked into granting additional permissions to the malicious apps which later enable them to perform various nefarious activities including intercepting texts or calls and stealing banking credentials. Avast Threat Labs also discovered that many pre-installed apps on several hundred new Android devices contain dangerous malware and adware. Some of the preinstalled malware can commit ad fraud or even take over its host device.In 2020 the Which. watchdog reported that more than billion Android devices released in 2012 or earlier which was 40 of Android devices worldwide were at risk of being hacked. This conclusion stemmed from the fact that no security updates were issued for the Android versions below 7.0 in 2019. Which. collaborated with the AV Comparatives anti-virus lab to infect five phone models with malware and it succeeded in each case. Google refused to comment on the watchdog 's speculations.On August 2020 Twitter published blog urging its users to update their applications to the latest version with regards to security concern that allowed others to access direct messages. hacker could easily use the Android system permissions to fetch the account credentials in order to do so. The security issue is only with Android Android Oreo and Android Android Pie. Twitter confirmed that updating the app will restrict such practices. Technical security features Android applications run in sandbox an isolated area of the system that does not have access to the rest of the system 's resources unless access permissions are explicitly granted by the user when the application is installed however this may not be possible for pre-installed apps. It is not possible for example to turn off the microphone access of the pre-installed camera app without disabling the camera completely. This is valid also in Android versions and 8.Since February 2012 Google has used its Google Bouncer malware scanner to watch over and scan apps available in the Google Play store. Verify Apps feature was introduced in November 2012 as part of the Android 4.2 Jelly Bean operating system version to scan all apps both from Google Play and from third-party sources for malicious behaviour. Originally only doing so during installation Verify Apps received an update in 2014 to constantly scan apps and in 2017 the feature was made visible to users through menu in Settings.Before installing an application the Google Play store displays list of the requirements an app needs to function. After reviewing these permissions the user can choose to accept or refuse them installing the application only if they accept. In Android 6.0 Marshmallow the permissions system was changed apps are no longer automatically granted all of their specified permissions at installation time. An opt-in system is used instead in which users are prompted to grant or deny individual permissions to an app when they are needed for the first time. Applications remember the grants which can be revoked by the user at any time. Pre-installed apps however are not always part of this approach. In some cases it may not be possible to deny certain permissions to pre-installed apps nor be possible to disable them. The Google Play Services app can not be uninstalled nor disabled. Any force stop attempt result in the app restarting itself. The new permissions model is used only by applications developed for Marshmallow using its software development kit SDK and older apps will continue to use the previous all-or-nothing approach. Permissions can still be revoked for those apps though this might prevent them from working properly and warning is displayed to that effect.In September 2014 Jason Nova of Android Authority reported on study by the German security company Fraunhofer AISEC in antivirus software and malware threats on Android. Nova wrote that The Android operating system deals with software packages by sandboxing them this does not allow applications to list the directory contents of other apps to keep the system safe. By not allowing the antivirus to list the directories of other apps after installation applications that show no inherent suspicious behavior when downloaded are cleared as safe. If then later on parts of the app are activated that turn out to be malicious the antivirus will have no way to know since it is inside the app and out of the antivirus jurisdiction. The study by Fraunhofer AISEC examining antivirus software from Avast AVG Bitdefender ESET F-Secure Kaspersky Lookout McAfee formerly Intel Security Norton Sophos and Trend Micro revealed that the tested antivirus apps do not provide protection against customized malware or targeted attacks and that the tested antivirus apps were also not able to detect malware which is completely unknown to date but does not make any efforts to hide its malignity .In August 2013 Google announced Android Device Manager renamed Find My Device in May 2017 service that allows users to remotely track locate and wipe their Android device with an Android app for the service released in December. In December 2016 Google introduced Trusted Contacts app letting users request location-tracking of loved ones during emergencies. In 2020 Trusted Contacts was shut down and the location-sharing feature rolled into Google Maps.On October 2018 Google announced new Google Play store requirements to combat over-sharing of potentially sensitive information including call and text logs. The issue stems from the fact that many apps request permissions to access users personal information even if this information is not needed for the app to function and some users unquestionably grant these permissions. Alternatively permission might be listed in the app manifest as required as opposed to optional and the app would not install unless user grants the permission users can withdraw any even required permissions from any app in the device settings after app installation but few users do this. Google promised to work with developers and create exceptions if their apps require Phone or SMS permissions for core app functionality. The new policies enforcement started on January 2019 90 days after policy announcement on October 2018. Furthermore Google announced new target API level requirement targetSdkVersion in manifest at least Android 8.0 API level 26 for all new apps and app updates. The API level requirement might combat the practice of app developers bypassing some permission screens by specifying early Android versions that had coarser permission model. ==== Verified Boot ==== The Android Open Source Project implements verified boot chain with intentions to verify that executed code such as the kernel or bootloader comes from an official source instead of malicious actor. This implementation establishes full chain of trust as it initially starts at hardware level. Subsequently the boot loader is verified and system partitions such as system and vendor are checked for integrity.Furthermore this process verifies that previous version of Android has not been installed. This effectively provides rollback protection which mitigates exploits that are similar to downgrade attack. ===== dm-verity ===== Android all supported versions as far back as version 4.4 of the Android Open Source Project has the option to provide verified boot chain with dm-verity. This is feature in the Linux kernel that allows for transparent integrity checking of block devices.This feature is designed to mitigate persistent rootkits. Google Play Services and vendor changes Dependence on proprietary Google Play Services and customizations added on top of the operating system by vendors who license Android from Google is causing privacy concerns. Licensing The source code for Android is open-source it is developed in private by Google with the source code released publicly when new version of Android is released. Google publishes most of the code including network and telephony stacks under the non-copyleft Apache License version 2.0. which allows modification and redistribution. The license does not grant rights to the Android trademark so device manufacturers and wireless carriers have to license it from Google under individual contracts. Associated Linux kernel changes are released under the copyleft GNU General Public License version developed by the Open Handset Alliance with the source code publicly available at all times. The only Android release which was not immediately made available as source code was the tablet-only 3.0 Honeycomb release. The reason according to Andy Rubin in an official Android blog post was because Honeycomb was rushed for production of the Motorola Xoom and they did not want third parties creating really bad user experience by attempting to put onto smartphones version of Android intended for tablets.Only the base Android operating system including some applications is open-source software whereas most Android devices ship with substantial amount of proprietary software such as Google Mobile Services which includes applications such as Google Play Store Google Search and Google Play Services software layer that provides APIs for the integration with Google-provided services among others. These applications must be licensed from Google by device makers and can only be shipped on devices which meet its compatibility guidelines and other requirements. Custom certified distributions of Android produced by manufacturers such as Samsung Experience may also replace certain stock Android apps with their own proprietary variants and add additional software not included in the stock Android operating system. With the advent of the Google Pixel line of devices Google itself has also made specific Android features timed or permanent exclusives to the Pixel series. There may also be binary blob drivers required for certain hardware components in the device. The best known fully open source Android services are the LineageOS distribution and MicroG which acts as an open source replacement of Google Play Services. Richard Stallman and the Free Software Foundation have been critical of Android and have recommended the usage of alternatives such as Replicant because drivers and firmware vital for the proper functioning of Android devices are usually proprietary and because the Google Play Store application can forcibly install or uninstall applications and as result invite non-free software. In both cases the use of closed-source software causes the system to become vulnerable to backdoors.It has been argued that because developers are often required to purchase the Google-branded Android license this has turned the theoretically open system into freemium service. 20 Leverage over manufacturers Google licenses their Google Mobile Services software along with the Android trademarks only to hardware manufacturers for devices that meet Google 's compatibility standards specified in the Android Compatibility Program document. Thus forks of Android that make major changes to the operating system itself do not include any of Google 's non-free components stay incompatible with applications that require them and must ship with an alternative software marketplace in lieu of Google Play Store. prominent example of such an Android fork is Amazon 's Fire OS which is used on the Kindle Fire line of tablets and oriented toward Amazon services. The shipment of Android devices without GMS is also common in mainland China as Google does not do business there.In 2014 Google also began to require that all Android devices which license the Google Mobile Services software display prominent Powered by Android logo on their boot screens. Google has also enforced preferential bundling and placement of Google Mobile Services on devices including mandated bundling of the entire main suite of Google applications mandatory placement of shortcuts to Google Search and the Play Store app on or near the main home screen page in its default configuration and granting larger share of search revenue to OEMs who agree to not include third-party app stores on their devices. In March 2018 it was reported that Google had begun to block uncertified Android devices from using Google Mobile Services software and display warning indicating that the device manufacturer has preloaded Google apps and services without certification from Google. Users of custom ROMs can register their device ID to their Google account to remove this block.Some stock applications and components in AOSP code that were formerly used by earlier versions of Android such as Search Music Calendar and the location API were abandoned by Google in favor of non-free replacements distributed through Play Store Google Search Google Play Music and Google Calendar and Google Play Services which are no longer open-source. Moreover open-source variants of some applications also exclude functions that are present in their non-free versions. These measures are likely intended to discourage forks and encourage commercial licensing in line with Google requirements as the majority of the operating system 's core functionality is dependent on proprietary components licensed exclusively by Google and it would take significant development resources to develop an alternative suite of software and APIs to replicate or replace them. Apps that do not use Google components would also be at functional disadvantage as they can only use APIs contained within the OS itself. In turn third-party apps may have dependencies on Google Play Services.Members of the Open Handset Alliance which include the majority of Android OEMs are also contractually forbidden from producing Android devices based on forks of the OS in 2012 Acer Inc. was forced by Google to halt production on device powered by Alibaba Group 's Aliyun OS with threats of removal from the OHA as Google deemed the platform to be an incompatible version of Android. Alibaba Group defended the allegations arguing that the OS was distinct platform from Android primarily using HTML5 apps but incorporated portions of Android 's platform to allow backwards compatibility with third-party Android software. Indeed the devices did ship with an application store which offered Android apps however the majority of them were pirated. Reception Android received lukewarm reaction when it was unveiled in 2007. Although analysts were impressed with the respected technology companies that had partnered with Google to form the Open Handset Alliance it was unclear whether mobile phone manufacturers would be willing to replace their existing operating systems with Android. The idea of an open-source Linux-based development platform sparked interest but there were additional worries about Android facing strong competition from established players in the smartphone market such as Nokia and Microsoft and rival Linux mobile operating systems that were in development. These established players were skeptical Nokia was quoted as saying we do n't see this as threat and member of Microsoft 's Windows Mobile team stated do n't understand the impact that they are going to have. Since then Android has grown to become the most widely used smartphone operating system and one of the fastest mobile experiences available. Reviewers have highlighted the open-source nature of the operating system as one of its defining strengths allowing companies such as Nokia Nokia family Amazon Kindle Fire Barnes Noble Nook Ouya Baidu and others to fork the software and release hardware running their own customised version of Android. As result it has been described by technology website Ars Technica as practically the default operating system for launching new hardware for companies without their own mobile platforms. This openness and flexibility is also present at the level of the end user Android allows extensive customisation of devices by their owners and apps are freely available from non-Google app stores and third party websites. These have been cited as among the main advantages of Android phones over others.Despite Android 's popularity including an activation rate three times that of iOS there have been reports that Google has not been able to leverage their other products and web services successfully to turn Android into the money maker that analysts had expected. The Verge suggested that Google is losing control of Android due to the extensive customization and proliferation of non-Google apps and services Amazon 's Kindle Fire line uses Fire OS heavily modified fork of Android which does not include or support any of Google 's proprietary components and requires that users obtain software from its competing Amazon Appstore instead of Play Store. In 2014 in an effort to improve prominence of the Android brand Google began to require that devices featuring its proprietary components display an Android logo on the boot screen.Android has suffered from fragmentation situation where the variety of Android devices in terms of both hardware variations and differences in the software running on them makes the task of developing applications that work consistently across the ecosystem harder than rival platforms such as iOS where hardware and software varies less. For example according to data from OpenSignal in July 2013 there were 11,868 models of Android devices numerous screen sizes and eight Android OS versions simultaneously in use while the large majority of iOS users have upgraded to the latest iteration of that OS. Critics such as Apple Insider have asserted that fragmentation via hardware and software pushed Android 's growth through large volumes of low end budget-priced devices running older versions of Android. They maintain this forces Android developers to write for the lowest common denominator to reach as many users as possible who have too little incentive to make use of the latest hardware or software features only available on smaller percentage of devices. However OpenSignal who develops both Android and iOS apps concluded that although fragmentation can make development trickier Android 's wider global reach also increases the potential reward. Market share Android is the most used operating system on phones in virtually all countries with some countries such as India having over 96 market share. On tablets usage is more even as iOS is bit more popular globally. Research company Canalys estimated in the second quarter of 2009 that Android had 2.8 share of worldwide smartphone shipments. By May 2010 Android had 10 worldwide smartphone market share overtaking Windows Mobile whilst in the US Android held 28 share overtaking iPhone OS. By the fourth quarter of 2010 its worldwide share had grown to 33 of the market becoming the top-selling smartphone platform overtaking Symbian. In the US it became the top-selling platform in April 2011 overtaking BlackBerry OS with 31.2 smartphone share according to comScore.By the third quarter of 2011 Gartner estimated that more than half 52.5 of the smartphone sales belonged to Android. By the third quarter of 2012 Android had 75 share of the global smartphone market according to the research firm IDC.In July 2011 Google said that 550,000 Android devices were being activated every day up from 400,000 per day in May and more than 100 million devices had been activated with 4.4 growth per week. In September 2012 500 million devices had been activated with 1.3 million activations per day. In May 2013 at Google I/O Sundar Pichai announced that 900 million Android devices had been activated.Android market share varies by location. In July 2012 mobile subscribers aged 13+ in the United States using Android were up to 52 and rose to 90 in China. During the third quarter of 2012 Android 's worldwide smartphone shipment market share was 75 with 750 million devices activated in total. In April 2013 Android had 1.5 million activations per day. As of May 2013 48 billion application app installation have been performed from the Google Play store and by September 2013 one billion Android devices had been activated.As of August 2020 the Google Play store had over million Android applications published and as of May 2016 apps had been downloaded more than 65 billion times. The operating system 's success has made it target for patent litigation as part of the so-called smartphone wars between technology companies.Android devices account for more than half of smartphone sales in most markets including the US while only in Japan was Apple on top September–November 2013 numbers. At the end of 2013 over 1.5 billion Android smartphones had been sold in the four years since 2010 making Android the most sold phone and tablet OS. Three billion Android smartphones were estimated to be sold by the end of 2014 including previous years. According to Gartner research company Android-based devices outsold all contenders every year since 2012. In 2013 it outsold Windows 2.8:1 or by 573 million. As of 2015 Android has the largest installed base of all operating systems Since 2013 devices running it also sell more than Windows iOS and Mac OS devices combined.According to StatCounter which tracks only the use for browsing the web Android is the most popular mobile operating system since August 2013. Android is the most popular operating system for web browsing in India and several other countries e.g. virtually all of Asia with Japan and North Korea exceptions. According to StatCounter Android is most used on mobile in all African countries and it stated mobile usage has already overtaken desktop in several countries including India South Africa and Saudi Arabia with virtually all countries in Africa having done so already except for seven countries including Egypt such as Ethiopia and Kenya in which mobile including tablets usage is at 90.46 Android only accounts for 75.81 of all use there .While Android phones in the Western world almost always include Google 's proprietary code such as Google Play in the otherwise open-source operating system Google 's proprietary code and trademark is increasingly not used in emerging markets The growth of AOSP Android devices goes way beyond just China .. ABI Research claims that 65 million devices shipped globally with open-source Android in the second quarter of 2014 up from 54 million in the first quarter depending on country percent of phones estimated to be based only on AOSP source code forgoing the Android trademark Thailand 44 Philippines 38 Indonesia 31 India 21 Malaysia 24 Mexico 18 Brazil .According to January 2015 Gartner report Android surpassed billion shipments of devices in 2014 and will continue to grow at double-digit pace in 2015 with 26 percent increase year over year. This made it the first time that any general-purpose operating system has reached more than one billion end users within year by reaching close to 1.16 billion end users in 2014 Android shipped over four times more than iOS and OS combined and over three times more than Microsoft Windows. Gartner expected the whole mobile phone market to reach two billion units in 2016 including Android. Describing the statistics Farhad Manjoo wrote in The New York Times that About one of every two computers sold today is running Android. It has become Earth 's dominant computing platform. According to Statistica 's estimate Android smartphones had an installed base of 1.8 billion units in 2015 which was 76 of the estimated total number of smartphones worldwide. Android has the largest installed base of any mobile operating system and since 2013 the highest-selling operating system overall with sales in 2012 2013 and 2014 close to the installed base of all PCs.In the second quarter of 2014 Android 's share of the global smartphone shipment market was 84.7 new record. This had grown to 87.5 worldwide market share by the third quarter of 2016 leaving main competitor iOS with 12.1 market share.According to an April 2017 StatCounter report Android overtook Microsoft Windows to become the most popular operating system for total Internet usage. It has maintained the plurality since then.In September 2015 Google announced that Android had 1.4 billion monthly active users. This changed to billion monthly active users in May 2017. Adoption on tablets Despite its success on smartphones initially Android tablet adoption was slow then later caught up with the iPad in most countries. One of the main causes was the chicken or the egg situation where consumers were hesitant to buy an Android tablet due to lack of high quality tablet applications but developers were hesitant to spend time and resources developing tablet applications until there was significant market for them. The content and app ecosystem proved more important than hardware specs as the selling point for tablets. Due to the lack of Android tablet-specific applications in 2011 early Android tablets had to make do with existing smartphone applications that were ill-suited to larger screen sizes whereas the dominance of Apple 's iPad was reinforced by the large number of tablet-specific iOS applications.Despite app support in its infancy considerable number of Android tablets like the Barnes Noble Nook alongside those using other operating systems such as the HP TouchPad and BlackBerry PlayBook were rushed out to market in an attempt to capitalize on the success of the iPad. InfoWorld has suggested that some Android manufacturers initially treated their first tablets as Frankenphone business short-term low-investment opportunity by placing smartphone-optimized Android OS before Android 3.0 Honeycomb for tablets was available on device while neglecting user interface. This approach such as with the Dell Streak failed to gain market traction with consumers as well as damaging the early reputation of Android tablets. Furthermore several Android tablets such as the Motorola Xoom were priced the same or higher than the iPad which hurt sales. An exception was the Amazon Kindle Fire which relied upon lower pricing as well as access to Amazon 's ecosystem of applications and content.This began to change in 2012 with the release of the affordable Nexus and push by Google for developers to write better tablet applications. According to International Data Corporation shipments of Android-powered tablets surpassed iPads in Q3 2012. As of the end of 2013 over 191.6 million Android tablets had sold in three years since 2011. This made Android tablets the most-sold type of tablet in 2013 surpassing iPads in the second quarter of 2013.According to StatCounter 's web use statistics as of 2020 Android tablets represent the majority of tablet devices used in Africa 70 South America 65 while less than half elsewhere e.g. Europe 44 Asia 44 North America 34 and Oceania/Australia 18. There are countries on all continents where Android tablets are the majority for example Mexico.In March 2016 Galen Gruman of InfoWorld stated that Android devices could be real part of your business .. there 's no longer reason to keep Android at arm 's length. It can now be as integral to your mobile portfolio as Apple 's iOS devices are. year earlier Gruman had stated that Microsoft 's own mobile Office apps were better on iOS and Android than on Microsoft 's own Windows 10 devices. Platform information The recently released Android 12 is the most popular Android version on both smartphones and tablets and with next most popular Android 11 at 51 combined share and at 70 for all supported version. As of January 2023 Android 12 is most popular on smartphones at 28 followed by Android 11. Android 13 the most recent version is 4th most popular at over 10. Usage of Android 10 and newer i.e. supported versions is at 78 the rest of users are not supported with security updates. Android 13 is most popular in Canada and in some Nordic countries.On tablets Android 12 is most popular at 19 followed by Android 11. Usage of Android 10 and newer i.e. supported versions is at 43 on Android tablets with Pie 9.O until recently supported at 61. The usage share varies lot by country e.g. Android 9.0 Pie is the version with the greatest usage share in the United States also in the UK at 36 while Android 11 is also very popular e.g. most used in Australia Russia and Oreo 8.1 most used in China. As of July 2021 66 of devices have Vulkan support 47 on newer Vulkan 1.1 the successor to OpenGL. At the same time 91.5 of the devices have support for OpenGL ES 3.0 or higher in addition the rest of devices 8.50 use version 2.0 with 73.50 using the latest version OpenGL ES 3.2. Application piracy In general paid Android applications can easily be pirated. In May 2012 interview with Eurogamer the developers of Football Manager stated that the ratio of pirated players vs legitimate players was 9:1 for their game Football Manager Handheld. However not every developer agreed that piracy rates were an issue for example in July 2012 the developers of the game Wind-up Knight said that piracy levels of their game were only 12 and most of the piracy came from China where people can not purchase apps from Google Play.In 2010 Google released tool for validating authorized purchases for use within apps but developers complained that this was insufficient and trivial to crack. Google responded that the tool especially its initial release was intended as sample framework for developers to modify and build upon depending on their needs not as finished piracy solution. Android Jelly Bean introduced the ability for paid applications to be encrypted so that they may work only on the device for which they were purchased. Legal issues The success of Android has made it target for patent and copyright litigation between technology companies both Android and Android phone manufacturers having been involved in numerous patent lawsuits and other legal challenges. Patent lawsuit with Oracle On August 12 2010 Oracle sued Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents related to the Java programming language. Oracle originally sought damages up to 6.1 billion but this valuation was rejected by United States federal judge who asked Oracle to revise the estimate. In response Google submitted multiple lines of defense counterclaiming that Android did not infringe on Oracle 's patents or copyright that Oracle 's patents were invalid and several other defenses. They said that Android 's Java runtime environment is based on Apache Harmony clean room implementation of the Java class libraries and an independently developed virtual machine called Dalvik. In May 2012 the jury in this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle 's patents and the trial judge ruled that the structure of the Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for small amount of copied code. On May 2014 the Federal Circuit partially reversed the district court ruling ruling in Oracle 's favor on the copyrightability issue and remanding the issue of fair use to the district court.In December 2015 Google announced that the next major release of Android Android Nougat would switch to OpenJDK which is the official open-source implementation of the Java platform instead of using the now-discontinued Apache Harmony project as its runtime. Code reflecting this change was also posted to the AOSP source repository. In its announcement Google claimed this was part of an effort to create common code base between Java on Android and other platforms. Google later admitted in court filing that this was part of an effort to address the disputes with Oracle as its use of OpenJDK code is governed under the GNU General Public License GPL with linking exception and that any damages claim associated with the new versions expressly licensed by Oracle under OpenJDK would require separate analysis of damages from earlier releases. In June 2016 United States federal court ruled in favor of Google stating that its use of the APIs was fair use.In April 2021 the United Supreme Court ruled that Google 's use of the Java APIs was within the bounds of fair use reversing the Federal Circuit Appeals Court ruling and remanding the case for further hearing. The majority opinion began with the assumption that the APIs may be copyrightable and thus proceeded with review of the factors that contributed to fair use. Anti-competitive challenges in Europe In 2013 FairSearch lobbying organization supported by Microsoft Oracle and others filed complaint regarding Android with the European Commission alleging that its free-of-charge distribution model constituted anti-competitive predatory pricing. The Free Software Foundation Europe whose donors include Google disputed the Fairsearch allegations. On April 20 2016 the EU filed formal antitrust complaint against Google based upon the FairSearch allegations arguing that its leverage over Android vendors including the mandatory bundling of the entire suite of proprietary Google software hindering the ability for competing search providers to be integrated into Android and barring vendors from producing devices running forks of Android constituted anti-competitive practices. In August 2016 Google was fined US 6.75 million by the Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service FAS under similar allegations by Yandex. The European Commission issued its decision on July 18 2018 determining that Google had conducted three operations related to Android that were in violation of antitrust regulations bundling Google 's search and Chrome as part of Android blocking phone manufacturers from using forked versions of Android and establishing deals with phone manufacturers and network providers to exclusively bundle the Google search application on handsets practice Google ended by 2014. The EU fined Google for €4.3 billion about US billion and required the company to end this conduct within 90 days. Google filed its appeal of the ruling in October 2018 though will not ask for any interim measures to delay the onset of conduct requirements.On October 16 2018 Google announced that it would change its distribution model for Google Mobile Services in the EU since part of its revenues streams for Android which came through use of Google Search and Chrome were now prohibited by the EU 's ruling. While the core Android system remains free OEMs in Europe would be required to purchase paid license to the core suite of Google applications such as Gmail Google Maps and the Google Play Store. Google Search will be licensed separately with an option to include Google Chrome at no additional cost atop Search. European OEMs can bundle third-party alternatives on phones and devices sold to customers if they so choose. OEMs will no longer be barred from selling any device running incompatible versions of Android in Europe. Others In addition to lawsuits against Google directly various proxy wars have been waged against Android indirectly by targeting manufacturers of Android devices with the effect of discouraging manufacturers from adopting the platform by increasing the costs of bringing an Android device to market. Both Apple and Microsoft have sued several manufacturers for patent infringement with Apple 's ongoing legal action against Samsung being particularly high-profile case. In January 2012 Microsoft said they had signed patent license agreements with eleven Android device manufacturers whose products account for 70 percent of all Android smartphones sold in the US and 55 of the worldwide revenue for Android devices. These include Samsung and HTC. Samsung 's patent settlement with Microsoft included an agreement to allocate more resources to developing and marketing phones running Microsoft 's Windows Phone operating system. Microsoft has also tied its own Android software to patent licenses requiring the bundling of Microsoft Office Mobile and Skype applications on Android devices to subsidize the licensing fees while at the same time helping to promote its software lines.Google has publicly expressed its frustration for the current patent landscape in the United States accusing Apple Oracle and Microsoft of trying to take down Android through patent litigation rather than innovating and competing with better products and services. In August 2011 Google purchased Motorola Mobility for US 12.5 billion which was viewed in part as defensive measure to protect Android since Motorola Mobility held more than 17,000 patents. In December 2011 Google bought over thousand patents from IBM.Turkey 's competition authority investigations about default search engine in Android started in 2017 led to US 17.4 million fine in September 2018 and fine of 0.05 percent of Google 's revenue per day in November 2019 when Google did n't meet the requirements. In December 2019 Google stopped issuing licenses for new Android phone models sold in Turkey. Other uses Google has developed several variations of Android for specific use cases including Android Wear later renamed Wear OS for wearable devices such as wrist watches Android TV for televisions Android Things for smart or Internet of things devices and Android Automotive for cars. Additionally by providing infrastructure that combines dedicated hardware and dedicated applications running on regular Android Google have opened up the platform for its use in particular usage scenarios such as the Android Auto app for cars and Daydream Virtual Reality platform.The open and customizable nature of Android allows device makers to use it on other electronics as well including laptops netbooks and desktop computers cameras headphones home automation systems game consoles media players satellites routers printers payment terminals automated teller machines and robots. Additionally Android has been installed and run on variety of less-technical objects including calculators single-board computers feature phones electronic dictionaries alarm clocks refrigerators landline telephones coffee machines bicycles and mirrors.Ouya video game console running Android became one of the most successful Kickstarter campaigns crowdfunding US 8.5m for its development and was later followed by other Android-based consoles such as Nvidia 's Shield Portable an Android device in video game controller form factor.In 2011 Google demonstrated Android Home home automation technology which uses Android to control range of household devices including light switches power sockets and thermostats. Prototype light bulbs were announced that could be controlled from an Android phone or tablet but Android head Andy Rubin was cautious to note that turning lightbulb on and off is nothing new pointing to numerous failed home automation services. Google he said was thinking more ambitiously and the intention was to use their position as cloud services provider to bring Google products into customers homes. Parrot unveiled an Android-based car stereo system known as Asteroid in 2011 followed by successor the touchscreen-based Asteroid Smart in 2012. In 2013 Clarion released its own Android-based car stereo the AX1. In January 2014 at the Consumer Electronics Show CES Google announced the formation of the Open Automotive Alliance group including several major automobile makers Audi General Motors Hyundai and Honda and Nvidia which aims to produce Android-based in-car entertainment systems for automobiles bringing the best of Android into the automobile in safe and seamless way. Android comes preinstalled on few laptops similar functionality of running Android applications is also available in Google 's ChromeOS and can also be installed on personal computers by end users. On those platforms Android provides additional functionality for physical keyboards and mice together with the Alt-Tab key combination for switching applications quickly with keyboard. In December 2014 one reviewer commented that Android 's notification system is vastly more complete and robust than in most environments and that Android is absolutely usable as one 's primary desktop operating system.In October 2015 The Wall Street Journal reported that Android will serve as Google 's future main laptop operating system with the plan to fold ChromeOS into it by 2017. Google 's Sundar Pichai who led the development of Android explained that mobile as computing paradigm is eventually going to blend with what we think of as desktop today. Also back in 2009 Google co-founder Sergey Brin himself said that ChromeOS and Android would likely converge over time. Lockheimer who replaced Pichai as head of Android and ChromeOS responded to this claim with an official Google blog post stating that While we 've been working on ways to bring together the best of both operating systems there 's no plan to phase out ChromeOS which has guaranteed auto-updates for five years. That is unlike Android where support is shorter with EOL dates being .. at least years into the future for Android tablets for education .At Google I/O in May 2016 Google announced Daydream virtual reality platform that relies on smartphone and provides VR capabilities through virtual reality headset and controller designed by Google itself. The platform is built into Android starting with Android Nougat differentiating from standalone support for VR capabilities. The software is available for developers and was released in 2016. Mascot The mascot of Android is green android robot as related to the software 's name. Although it has no official name the Android team at Google reportedly call it Bugdroid .It was designed by then-Google graphic designer Irina Blok on November 2007 when Android was announced. Contrary to reports that she was tasked with project to create an icon Blok confirmed in an interview that she independently developed it and made it open source. The robot design was initially not presented to Google but it quickly became commonplace in the Android development team with various variations of it created by the developers there who liked the figure as it was free under Creative Commons license. Its popularity amongst the development team eventually led to Google adopting it as an official icon as part of the Android logo when it launched to consumers in 2008.

Alibi,An alibi from the Latin alibī meaning somewhere else is statement by person who is possible perpetrator of crime of where they were at the time particular offence was committed which is somewhere other than where the crime took place. During police investigation all possible suspects are usually asked to provide details of their whereabouts during the relevant time period which where possible would usually be confirmed by other persons or in other ways such as by checking phone records or credit card receipts use of CCTV etc. During criminal trial an alibi is defence raised by the accused as proof that they could not have committed the crime because they were in some other place at the time the alleged offence was committed. The Criminal Law Deskbook of Criminal Procedure states Alibi is different from all of the other defences it is based upon the premise that the defendant is truly innocent.,An alibi from the Latin alibī meaning somewhere else is statement by person who is possible perpetrator of crime of where they were at the time particular offence was committed which is somewhere other than where the crime took place. During police investigation all possible suspects are usually asked to provide details of their whereabouts during the relevant time period which where possible would usually be confirmed by other persons or in other ways such as by checking phone records or credit card receipts use of CCTV etc. During criminal trial an alibi is defence raised by the accused as proof that they could not have committed the crime because they were in some other place at the time the alleged offence was committed. The Criminal Law Deskbook of Criminal Procedure states Alibi is different from all of the other defences it is based upon the premise that the defendant is truly innocent. Duty to disclose In some legal jurisdictions there may be requirement that the accused disclose an alibi defence prior to the trial. This is to enable the investigators to verify whether or not such claim is true. This is an exception to the rule that criminal defendant can not normally be compelled to furnish information to the prosecution. Since the alibi involves evidence of innocence rather than guilt the privilege against self-incrimination is not implicated.In Canada the defence must disclose an alibi defence with sufficient time for the authorities to investigate the alibi and with sufficient particularization to allow for meaningful investigation. Failure to comply with the two requirements will result in the court making an adverse inference against the alibi defence but will not result in the exclusion of the alibi defence .Conversely some judges in other jurisdictions have held the opinion that the mandatory early disclosure of alibis is unfair possibly even unconstitutional. False alibi The giving of false alibi beside resulting in possible subsequent criminal offences obstruction of justice perjury etc. may in some jurisdictions result in negative ramifications for the trial itself. In Canada the giving of false alibi may be used by the court as actual evidence of guilt provided certain requirements are met. Specifically The alibi must not be believed There is evidence of an intention to fabricate the alibi that is independent from the evidence used to show the alibi is false and The court must reject all innocent explanations offered that would explain why false alibi was fabricated. Alibi agency An alibi agency also called an alibi network forges explanations for unexcused absences e.g. due to an extramarital affair or adultery. In other words alibi agencies are paid to lie for their customers. Originating in 1990s Japan such services appeared in Europe in 2004 where they were condemned as immoral by the Catholic Church in Germany. They are the subject of the 2006 movie The Alibi.

The season was awarded Peabody Award in the category of Entertainment and Children 's programs and Hugo Award for short form dramas. second season of Jessica Jones was ordered on January 17 2016. Episodes Cast and characters Production Development In October 2013 Marvel and Disney announced that Marvel Television and ABC Studios would provide Netflix with live action series centered around Daredevil Jessica Jones Iron Fist and Luke Cage leading up to miniseries based on the Defenders. Melissa Rosenberg was brought on to showrun the Jessica Jones series to be reconfigured as page one do-over from an original project she had developed in December 2010 for ABC. In December 2014 the official title was revealed to be Marvel 's A.K.A. Jessica Jones but that was shortened to Marvel 's Jessica Jones in June 2015. The season consists of 13 hour-long episodes. Writing The writers for the season worked in Los Angeles with one member of the writing team on set in New York for filming. Actress Carrie-Anne Moss talked about how the scripts developed through the production of the season explaining that the dialogue usually did not change much while filming but scenes were altered to accommodate the filming locations when necessary. Rosenberg stated that since Jones is private investigator there would be some procedural elements to the show but that 's not our focus. There are cases. In particular there is large case that carries over the season. Elaborating on this Marvel Television head Jeph Loeb said that the fun about being private detective is that the line between what 's legal and what 's not legal gets very blurred .... her drive is not always necessarily to solve the case as much as it is to go 'Okay can pay the rent. How am going to get through this day. He also added that inspiration for the season came from the noir films from the '40s and film like Chinatown. Describing the tone of the season Loeb said When we first started talking about Daredevil we promised that we were telling story that was first crime drama and then superhero show. This is more of psychological thriller. This speaks to when you think about what happened to Jessica and what sort of destroyed her life and how she tried to put it together and then to have to confront the person who deconstructed her world that 's very powerful emotional place to start from. On approaching rape and trauma in the season Rosenberg wanted to avoid actually showing rape which she called lazy storytelling and often way to spice up male characters and preferred to just make the trauma part of the characters everyday lives rather than an issue for the season to tackle. When asked about the adult nature of the season including the use of sex Rosenberg explained that Marvel would only not allow showing nudity and the use of the word 'fuck in the season. Regarding all of the social issues the season covered such as issues of choice interracial relationships domestic violence and issues of consent while also exploring feminism and being woman in this world Rosenberg said It was never our intention going in to hit social issue and think the minute you intend to do that you 're stepping up on soap box. If you 're digging into the dark side of the human psyche and all the different experiences we go through and as women we go through you 're going to find those things. If you treat them honestly and with respect you 're also going to hit social issues. Casting The main cast for the season includes Krysten Ritter as Jessica Jones Mike Colter as Luke Cage Rachael Taylor as Patricia Trish Walker Wil Traval as Will Simpson Erin Moriarty as Hope Shlottman Eka Darville as Malcolm Ducasse Carrie-Anne Moss as Jeri Hogarth and David Tennant as Kilgrave.Appearing in recurring roles for the season are Susie Abromeit as Pam Colby Minifie and Kieran Mulcare as Robyn and Ruben Nichole Yannetty as Nicole Clarke Peters as Oscar Clemons Michael Siberry and Lisa Emery as Albert and Louise Thompson and Robin Weigert as Wendy Ross-Hogarth. Danielle Ferland Gillian Glasco Ryan Farrell and Paul Pryce also recur as victims of Kilgrave who join support group established by Jones while Rosario Dawson and Royce Johnson reprise their roles of Claire Temple and Brett Mahoney respectively from Daredevil. Design Stephanie Maslansky returned as the costume designer for Jessica Jones from Daredevil and was assisted on the first episode by Jenn Rogien who crafted Jessica Jones leather jacket faded jeans and boots costume. On Jones 's costume Maslansky said she considers her clothing to be an armor and shield and something that helps her maintain distance from other people and privacy. It keeps her from having to deal with the rest of humanity in certain sort of way. At least 10 versions of Jones 's jacket were made which started as an Acne Studios leather motorcycle jacket that had any bells and whistles and any additional superfluous design details removed. 20 pairs of jeans were used with both sets of clothing being aged and distressed.Because Jones 's costume does not evolve much throughout the season Maslansky used flashbacks to show how her costume had evolved to the present day for 'pre-Kilgrave Jessica Jones Maslansky gave the character more pulled together clothes albeit still kind of edgy clothes that did not change who she was as character but were just different. For instance in flashback to Jones working in corporate environment she does not wear suit instead wear her jeans and find really cool jacket maybe vintage thing maybe something that she borrowed from Trish. For flashback where Jones wears large sandwich costume variety of costumes were ordered online with the chosen suit then distressed to look dirty and old mere shadow of its former sandwich self becoming more of hoagie than sandwich. In another flashback Jones imagines escaping Kilgrave 's control. The bright yellow dress the character wears in the dream sequence was chosen for its juxtaposition to the character 's real situation with Maslansky calling it so beautiful and so free and so light .For Kilgrave Maslansky used many suits created by designer Paul Smith rather than custom-making them as she originally planned as Smith was all about purple in the previous fashion season. On the suits Maslansky added that the designers wanted to find place where we could utilize clothing in shades of purple but not go so over the top that it would look silly and that he would stop feeling ominous or menacing. Expanding on this Maslansky called purple traditionally fairly friendly color and he 's anything but friendly. So had to find ways to make him be ominous and frightening and terrifying. found that needed the right proportion of shades of purple to other shades that were similar navy black maroon. Maslansky felt Luke Cage was also someone who wears his clothing like an armor with his wardrobe consisting of T-shirts jeans leather jackets or an army jacket. For character like Trish Walker who does not have the same kind of statement costume as Jones Maslansky tried to create certain character style. Maslansky said that Walker 's uniform is fashion so even when she was hanging around the house she was wearing pair of rag bone jeans with Chloé top and this was her version of T-shirt and jeans. Maslansky added that Robin was blast to dress because of her quirky personality yet she was still able to put herself together aesthetically. For Malcolm as his story progressively became brighter throughout the season so did his wardrobe becoming little brighter and little more hopeful. Filming In February 2014 Marvel announced that Jessica Jones would be filmed in New York City. In April Marvel Comics editor-in-chief Joe Quesada stated that the show would be filming in areas of Brooklyn and Long Island City that still look like the old Hell 's Kitchen in addition to sound stage work. The season went into production in February 2015 in the Bronx at Lehman College with the working title Violet and aimed to film each episode over nine days on average. Filming concluded in mid- to late August. Other filming locations in New York City used included the East Village 's Horseshoe Bar for Luke 's Bar the 33rd Street PATH station and PATH train the 101st Street area for the exterior of Jessica 's apartment with the interior apartment settings created on sound stage Douglaston Queens for Jessica 's childhood home the Angel Orensanz Center for Jessica and Luke 's fight in AKA Take Bloody Number Williamsburgh Savings Bank Tower and Pier 88 for locations in AKA Smile the Meatpacking District Nolita near the 39th Street entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel Tribeca Bryant Park Union Square Gramercy Greenpoint Brooklyn near the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant Long Island City including the Allied Extruder Factory for the weed-growing facility with exteriors shots taken from near Calvary Cemetery the Queensboro Bridge on the Queens side the Manhattan Bridge the Brooklyn Navy Yard Bethesda Terrace and Fountain in Central Park and Industry City.Concerning inspirations on the season Loeb revealed that Chinatown ... is one of the things that influenced Brian Michael Bendis and Michael Gaydos when they created the character. So those kind of beautiful long wide expansive shots where people sort of come into frame and go back out of frame and someone 's in the foreground and then someone is way in the background and they 're having conversation that 's the stuff that makes it interesting. Director of photography Manuel Billeter and episodic director S. J. Clarkson took inspiration from the comics in terms of their color palette while looking to the works of Wong Kar-wai as reference to create unconventional compositions with Billeter explaining There were lot of foreground elements and headroom as well and we never wanted to show an open frame. We wanted to create sense of claustrophobia. Billeter shot the season with Red Epic Dragon camera in 4K resolution with 5K used for some visual effects shots and with Panavision PVintage lenses he focused mostly on static frames and good composition but did occasionally employ camera dolly or steadicam. For lighting Billeter noted that many New York street lamps had been changed from sodium-vapor lamps to LEDs so he tried to recreate the warm dirty color of sodium vapor for night exterior scenes.Production designer Loren Weeks described Marvel 's Hell 's Kitchen as having little more East Village quality. To achieve the explosion at Luke 's Bar Weeks said We could not take out the windows at Horseshoe Bar which are made up of multiple small colored glass and metal frames. We did n't know frankly when we picked that location that we would have that explosion ... What we did was build fireproof box in the entrance and we had cannon in there which blew out debris and smoke and some fire. And then we did lighting effect on the inside and then the rest of the explosion was handled by visual effects. For the scenes on the PATH train and station location manager Jason Farrar noted that production had exclusive use of the tracks and platform during the day when ridership was low to get their shots. Visual effects Shade VFX created over 600 effects shots for the season with invisible effects the showpiece helping to push forward the darker elements the series. Therefore effects supervisor Karl Coyner and producer Julie Long worked closely with the crew on set to execute stunts set extensions explosions wetwork and fire sequences while filming rather than have Shade create those effects digitally. An effect that Shade was required to create was tinting Kilgrave 's skin purple in few key scenes where he is using his powers nod to the comic iteration 's purple-skinned appearance. Music At the 2015 San Diego Comic-Con International Sean Callery revealed he was composing music for Jessica Jones eventually stating that the music required for each episode ranged from to 20 minutes totaling approximately 415 minutes of music for the season. soundtrack album for the season was released by Marvel Music digitally on June 2016.All music composed by Sean Callery unless otherwise noted. Marvel Cinematic Universe tie-ins On existing in the MCU specifically in the same world as the other Netflix series Rosenberg said Jessica Jones is very very different show than Daredevil. We exist in cinematic universe and the mythology of the universe is connected but they look very different tonally they 're very different… That was my one concern coming in Am going to have to fit into Daredevil or what 's come before. And the answer is no. On references or easter eggs in the season Rosenberg explained that little is always there and in the writer 's room we have some fanboys that know all this stuff and they 're all geeking out with different stuff .... lot of references are to the Alias comic. She also said that nods to the larger MCU are in the season with each episode having little something in it. Jeryn Hogarth is closely associated with Iron Fist in the comics and also worked with Luke Cage as part of those characters Heroes for Hire team. Like Daredevil the season makes references to the events of The Avengers and the Avengers specifically Hulk and Captain America though not by name. Jessica also mentions Angela del Toro as another private investigator who in the comics is the hero White Tiger and has connections with K'un-Lun and Iron Fist. Paul Tassi writing for Forbes was disappointed with how the season fit into the larger MCU feeling the season seemed removed from the world of The Avengers and did not acknowledge Daredevil enough given that it 's supposed to be sharing at least this little corner of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with it. Eric Francisco of Inverse countered that Jessica Jones 's lack of overt connections to the MCU was the show 's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU 's scope really is Jessica Jones also proves the MCU 's thematic durability. Marketing In May 2015 Marvel announced plans to reprint Alias the comic that the series is based on with new covers from David Mack the original cover artist on the comic who is also providing artwork for the series opening credits. The reprints which were all released digitally in June 2015 and up to issue 15 in two trade paperbacks in September were intended to both celebrate the history of Jessica Jones and introduce new audiences to the character ahead of the release of the season. In late September through early October Marvel and Netflix released short teasers for the season which chronicled day of Jones life. Also in early October Marvel digitally released 12-page one-shot comic by the original Alias creative team—Bendis Gaydos and Mack—set in the universe of the television series. The one-shot was created as an exclusive for New York Comic Con where print version was distributed. The comic sees Jessica Jones coming into contact with Daredevil character Turk Barrett and includes short sequence featuring Daredevil to celebrate the connective tissue that will build between the series. Also during New York Comic Con Marvel set up street marketing campaign and screened AKA Ladies Night on October 10 while at the Marvel Booth fans could take their picture with the Alias Investigations desk with Kilgrave 's eyes appearing in the background of the final animation. Marvel additionally partnered with Uber during the event to provide select riders with complimentary trips to or from the convention in custom designed SUVs.A full trailer was released at the end of October with Meagan Damore of Comic Book Resources feeling that it helped establish the same tone as Daredevil and introduced Marvel 's creepiest villain yet with Kilgrave. She also compared Jessica to some of the other female characters of the MCU—Black Widow Melinda May and Peggy Carter—feeling that Jessica stood out from the others because she does not have sense of togetherness and was the most relatable because of her struggle with trauma and that the season would have the amount of creative space required to explore the character that the other female characters were lacking. second trailer was released on November 10 2015. Sarene Leeds of The Wall Street Journal felt that this trailer highlighted empowerment compared to the first that was about illustrating the fear behind Jones 's past. The season held its premiere in New York City on November 17. Release Streaming The first season of Jessica Jones was released on November 20 2015 on the streaming service Netflix in all territories where it is available in Ultra HD 4K. In January 2015 month after Marvel announced 2015 release for the season Sarandos had said that it was too hard to say now if the season would actually release in 2015 with Netflix 's plan to release Marvel series approximately year apart from each other after Daredevil 's April 2015 release. However Netflix soon confirmed that the season would indeed release in 2015 announcing the November 20 release date in September. The season was enhanced to be available in high dynamic range HDR after its initial release by post-production vendor Deluxe.The season along with the additional Jessica Jones seasons and the other Marvel Netflix series was removed from Netflix on March 2022 due to Netflix 's license for the series ending and Disney regaining the rights. The season became available on Disney+ in the United States Canada United Kingdom Ireland Australia and New Zealand on March 16 ahead of its debut in Disney+ 's other markets by the end of 2022. Home media The season was released on DVD in Region and Blu-ray in Region on August 22 2017 in Region and Region on December 2016 and in Region on December 2016. Reception Audience viewership As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on sample size of 15,000 people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting program 's sound. According to Symphony from September to December 2015 episodes of Jessica Jones averaged 4.8 million viewers during 35-day viewing cycle. The data was presented by Alan Wurtzel NBCUniversal president of research and media development in presentation aimed to provide perspective when stating digital platforms are hurting the traditional TV business. Netflix CCO Ted Sarandos responded to the data by saying that the whole methodology and the measurement and the data itself does n't reflect any sense of reality of anything that we keep track of. further study from Symphony for the same time period found Jessica Jones to be one of the four most watched series in the 18 to 24 demographic ahead of any broadcast network series. The marketing analytics firm Jumpshot determined the season was the fifth-most viewed Netflix season in the first 30 days after it premiered garnering 26 of the viewers that the second season of Daredevil received which was the most viewed season according to Jumpshot. Jumpshot which analyzes click-stream data from an online panel of more than 100 million consumers looked at the viewing behavior and activity of the company 's U.S. members factoring in the relative number of U.S. Netflix viewers who watched at least one episode of the season. Critical response The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported 94 approval rating with an average rating of 8.20/10 based on 80 reviews. The website 's critical consensus reads Jessica Jones builds multifaceted drama around its engaging antihero delivering what might be Marvel 's strongest TV franchise to date. Metacritic which uses weighted average assigned score of 81 out of 100 based on 32 critics indicating what the website considers to be universal acclaim .The early screening of the first episode at New York Comic Con was met by very positive reaction from the crowd. George Marston of Newsarama gave the first episode 10 out of 10 saying the season strikes balance between self-aware noir and Marvel 's first flirtations with psychological horror .... not just another hit for Marvel and Netflix but landmark moment for female superheroes on TV. Eric Goldman of IGN felt that Jessica Jones starts out with strong premiere episode that ... easily goes further than anything in the MCU in terms of sexuality. He called Ritter commendably tough sardonic Jessica Jones and praised the supporting cast for the strong impressions they made later scoring the episode an 8.5 out of 10. Evan Valentine of Collider gave the episode stars out of feeling that Tennant would ascend to the same level as Tom Hiddleston 's Loki and Vincent D'Onofrio 's Wilson Fisk as one of the cornerstones of villainy in the MCU. Katharine Trendacosta of io9 also had positive thoughts on AKA Ladies Night highlighting the episode 's use of light and color especially with purple and the way it portrays New York as how it actually looks—not overly bright and shiny and clean but not suffering never-ending power-outage either. Abraham Riesman noted the episode 's presentation of sexuality which was shockingly and refreshingly honest compared to Marvel 's other films and television series. He concluded by applauding the season 's bringing up of the topics of rape and PTSD.Reviewing the first seven episodes of the season Maureen Ryan of Variety gave positive thoughts on Jessica Jones stating The show which features an exceptional performance from Krysten Ritter and sure-handed guidance from executive producer Melissa Rosenberg is not just contender for the title Best Marvel-related TV property in supremely crowded TV scene it is one of the year 's most distinctive new dramas. Jack Shepard of The Independent also on the first seven episodes felt the season not only matches Daredevil but exceeds expectations. Shepard gave exceptional praise to Tennant 's Kilgrave feeling he was one of the best villains produced by Marvel and possibly the best on-screen comic book villain since Heath Ledger 's Joker. Forbes Merrill Barr stated that after seeing the first seven episodes the answer is resounding yes if lightning could strike twice for Marvel Television claiming In no uncertain terms Jessica Jones is the best thing Marvel Television has ever produced. It contains all the hopeful anticipation of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. all the feminist-overtones of Agent Carter and all the grittiness of Daredevil. Deadline Hollywood 's Dominic Patten also had praise for the season particularly Rosenberg 's influence on it the coverage of topics such as PTSD abuse assault shame and death and the cast highlighting Tennant 's Kilgrave as the actor 's best role as well as the MCU 's best villain. Mary McNamara from the Los Angeles Times felt Jessica Jones rewrote the definition of superhuman and was marvel lauding the season 's breathtaking examination of recovery from sexually emotionally and physically abusive relationship. Daniel Fienberg for The Hollywood Reporter was also positive saying the season looks and feels bit like cable anti-hero series—but it 's really more of post-hero story making it fascinating and unique in marketplace that does n't lack for costumed do-gooders of all types. His one criticism was that the show shares Jessica 's monomaniacal fixation on Kilgrave and the result is sort of narrative claustrophobia ... Everything in these opening episodes ties back to Kilgrave and Kilgrave is such twisted figure that it 's hard for any light to get in. Melissa Maerz of Entertainment Weekly was slightly more critical of the season awarding it. Though Maerz felt Ritter was good choice for Jessica and enjoyed the cinematography she felt the season could 've made for gritty character drama if it were n't for the noir clichés saxophone music shadows through glass and procedural structure that 's very CSI Marvel. The show 's biggest weakness is the same as Jessica 's It starts out with extraordinary potential but somewhere along the way it loses what make it special. Goldman later reviewing the whole season gave it 9.3 out of 10. He commended all the actors the relationship between Jessica and Trish and the episode Sin Bin though was critical of the character Robyn. Additionally Goldman also felt the season spent too many scenes devoted to Jeri 's marital strife and that it hit its peak bit before the actual end of the season similar to Daredevil with most of the thrilling moments earlier in the season. Analysis Libby Hill of the Los Angeles Times commented on how Jessica Jones exposed modern day sexism and misogyny through Kilgrave 's use of the phrase Smile calling the season the most innocuous and incisive cultural critique from Marvel to date. Hill likened an early scene that shows Kilgrave asking Jones to smile and her obliging to similar well-meaning scenarios that play out in the real world time and again each day many in the form of gendered street harassment that resonates with many women. Hill also added that Kilgrave serves as an exaggerated representation of perceived consent due to the response he gives later in the season to Jessica about never knowing if someone is doing what they want or what he tells them to do. She concludes that Jessica Jones is revolutionary because in acknowledging casual misogyny and exaggerating its most destructive tendencies it exposes the pervasive toxicity therein. It does all of this without making show of its politics instead resting easy on the knowledge that all too many women will relate to the subtleties of its premise. Amy C. Chambers writing for The Science and Entertainment Laboratory noted how the season moved away from sexism even more so than the comics by changing Kilgrave 's abilities from phermone based with particular effect on women to viral with equal effect no matter gender indicating that powerlessness is not gendered. Kwame Opam at The Verge chose to examine rape and the nature of consent in the season. Comparing Jessica Jones to other television series that have depicted rape Game of Thrones Orange Is the New Black and Outlander Opam felt that since rape is one of the show 's core themes we never need to see it ... rape is foundational part of the text and its presence is constant. Even if it 's invisible it 's always there. He also felt the season took the time to examine how rape happens and what it means especially in terms of power and consent concluding Jessica Jones moves the conversation about rape forward by treating it as complex subject worth investigating rather than as spice for story ... Maybe we do n't need to see it anymore to grasp how violent it is. Maybe our energies are better spent thinking deeply about why it happens at all. The Guardian 's Lili Loofbourow also discussed the season 's depiction of rape and consent noting the complications that come with Kilgrave telling his victims how to feel rather than just how to act and saying however exceptional Kilgrave 's power seems the moral quagmire it produces is all too common. It 's the condition of the rape victim who had an orgasm during her assault. It 's the condition of the soldier trained to kill when he suspects his targets are innocent. It 's the condition of the battered woman who goes back to her abuser and stays of her own free will. It 's the condition of ... any person really who agrees whatever the context to consent to forgo consent in the future. Loofbourow also discussed the character of Simpson comparing his power-inducing red pill to the anti-feminist red pillers and noting that his taking of the pills renders him not just dangerously delusional but so utterly at odds with nature and reality of any kind that he will forget to breathe unless he counteracts the pill 's effects. Accolades Jessica Jones was included on multiple Best/Top TV Shows of 2015 lists ranking on People 's 1st along with Daredevil Indiewire and The Star-Ledger 's 2nd NPR 's 3rd ScreenCrush 's 4th Digital Spy 's 5th Complex 's 6th Vulture 's 7th Slate Magazine 's 9th and TV Guide 's 11th. It was also included on un-ranked lists from Maureen Ryan of Variety Mary McNamara of the Los Angeles Times The Week and Wired. In December 2015 IGN named Jessica Jones the Netflix 's best original series released to date and it was named one of the Best New Shows of 2015 by Ryan as well as the tenth best new show of 2015 by Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen. The Atlantic named AKA WWJD. one of the best television episodes of 2015. Additionally Jessica Jones was the second most trending television series search on Google for 2015.

The story appeared in collection of short stories titled Keynotes published in 1893. It follows the interaction between woman and fisherman. Plot The short story begins by introducing woman. She meets fisherman and asks him where the river stream is most plentiful with trout. Their conversation becomes more playful as they continue to speak to one another. They flirt with each other and exchange playful banter but they never cross the line with physical touch because the woman is married. Reception When Egerton first published Keynotes she received rather positive reactions. She was praised for depicting women 's experiences and for presenting their souls to her audience. The short stories were well received until criticism began to arise. The subject matter Egerton presented was bit shocking to many readers. The sexual nature and non-traditional depiction of women caused reviewers to deem her works indecent. Her works were targeted due to the reviewers claims of aggressiveness and lack of manners.

'm just hearing it just as sound and music actually. have to disassociate myself from any of the emotional associations. Reception The authors of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings described Minton as stunning vocal improvisor with tonal and timbral range that seems quite uncanny and wrote 'Cenotaph and 'Wreath are only three quarters of minute apiece but overflowing with pain and pride anger and redemption while 'Notes on Avarice and 'Blasphemy demand frequent recourse to the repeat button. Writing for All About Jazz Glenn Astarita stated Doughnut in Both Hands is not for everyone and will rarely enjoy any long-term exposure via radio airplay however the conceptual approach is unique and perhaps revolutionary ... You will hear traces of operatic librettos yodeling garbled speech screeching folksy humor and just about anything he can envision supplemented by an astonishing set of vocal chords. Phil Minton documents the history of anything and everything that can be produced by the human voice. In separate AAJ review Robert Spencer commented Some of it is wrenching to hear it sounds like man in pain. Some of it is funny. There is no denying Minton 's audacity or inventiveness. How lasting all this will be remains to be seen but he is certainly exploring territory that will be further explored by others. jarring unique disc. In review for AllMusic François Couture noted that the album was one of the most influential contributions to free singing or as Paul Dutton calls it sound singing. Richard Cochrane of Metropolis wrote Minton 's techniques are too many and various to categorise. There 's everything here from overtone singing of the most exotic kinds right through yodelling to childish or animalistic noises .... Some of these effects are funny some frightening but all are very musical. Musician David Moss stated that his first exposure to Minton 's music was via Doughnut in Both Hands. He recalled thinking this guy can do things 've just barely been scratching at and did n't know how deep and far you could go. He reflected It was shocking. Almost too shocking.

Overview Coleman argues that the algorithms underlying artificial intelligence could greatly improve the human condition if the algorithms are carefully based on ethical human values. An ideal artificial intelligence would be not replicated model of our own brains but an expansion of our lens and our vantage point as to what intelligence life meaning and humanity are and can be. Failure in this regard might leave us species without purpose lacking any sense of happiness meaning or satisfaction. She states that despite stirrings of an algorithmic accountability movement humanity is alarmingly unready for the arrival of more powerful forms of artificial intelligence. Reception review in Library Journal strongly recommended the book to both the cyber crowds and those interested in human psychology. Kirkus Reviews called the book meaty and energetic. Publishers Weekly judged the book 's optimism to be unconvincing.

A Little Boy Lost,Little Boy Lost is poem of the Songs of Experience series created in 1794 after the Songs of Innocence 1789 by the poet William Blake. The poem centers on the theme of religious persecution and the corrupted dictates of dogmatic Church teachings. As part of Songs of Experience the poem is set in the wider context of exploring the suffering of innocent and oppressed individuals—in this case young boy and his parents—within flawed society that is oppressed and disillusioned with life 's experience.,Little Boy Lost is poem of the Songs of Experience series created in 1794 after the Songs of Innocence 1789 by the poet William Blake. The poem centers on the theme of religious persecution and the corrupted dictates of dogmatic Church teachings. As part of Songs of Experience the poem is set in the wider context of exploring the suffering of innocent and oppressed individuals—in this case young boy and his parents—within flawed society that is oppressed and disillusioned with life 's experience. The poem Analysis of the poem In this poem Blake 's titular character little boy appears by lights of Church pedantry to have questioned religious dogma to wit that every person must love God more than themselves or any other for his sacrilege the boy has instantly become lost to the Church. Reacting to his speech zealot Priest leaps to denounce the boy and to dramatize his offense. The little boy is peremptorily castigated as heretic and summarily burned at the stake even though the child 's age—he is little boy after all he sees the world through the eyes of child 's innocence—would seemingly preclude him from comprehending the awful construing of his words by the Priest as heresy. On the other hand reader might theorize that Blake intends to portray the child as precocious and with intentions to dissent from Church teaching—perhaps the Priest thinks so. However the actual words applied by the author to the boy 's speech offers very little toward this view instead it is the child 's innocent candor that seems to inspire his words. Background It appears the author has drawn the Priest as not merely parish priest but as metaphor for the hierarchical powers-that-be of the Church. Certainly Blake seems to hearken back to the time when the Church wielded almost unchecked powers throughout England and most of Europe to judge and destroy anyone it deemed intolerable in thought or behaviour. Blake wrote his poetry for the common man. Structure The poem is divided into six quatrains all in iambic tetrameter. The first quatrain introduces the subject of love of self in the voice of an omniscient narrator the language is highly stylized. The second quatrain is the much simpler speech of little boy expressing his thoughts on love of God of others and of nature. References.

Obama addressed the subjects of racial tensions white privilege and race and inequality in the United States discussing black anger white resentment and other issues as he sought to explain and contextualize Wright 's comments. His speech closed with plea to move beyond America 's racial stalemate and address shared social problems. On March 27 2008 the Pew Research Center called the speech arguably the biggest political event of the campaign so far noting that 85 percent of Americans said they had heard at least little about the speech and that 54 percent said they heard lot about it.

The story would later be published in the September 1939 issue of Weird Tales. Plot Our unnamed narrator is weary from his aimless wandering across the remote cities and roads of the old world. These wanderings began soon after the suicide of his wife Lady Mariel which was caused by his cruel and vicious temper. He soon stumbles upon Malnéant city enveloped by fog and the sepulchral tolling of mortuary bells. While roaming the mostly deserted streets the townspeople all tell him they are preparing items for the Lady Mariel 's funeral. The tavern and inn he approaches both deny him entry as all of Malnéant 's accommodations and services have been appropriated for Lady Mariel 's funeral. It is her funeral that is constantly being announced via the tolling of the mortuary bells. Despite the uncanny coincidence our narrator refuses to suspect connection to his late wife. He eventually follows the townspeople into the cathedral whereupon he is stunned to see that it truly is his Mariel lying dead within the coffin. Eventually he leaves the church and immediately loses his way in the labyrinthine city. After hours of roaming our narrator finally finds his way out of Malnéant.

It was replaced in September 1971 by the CBS Sunday Night Movie.In 2002 The Ed Sullivan Show was ranked No. 15 on TV Guide 's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time. In 2013 the series finished No. 31 in TV Guide Magazine 's 60 Best Series of All Time. History From 1948 until its cancellation in 1971 the show ran on CBS every Sunday night from 8–9 p.m. Eastern Time and it is one of the few entertainment shows to have run in the same weekly time slot on the same network for more than two decades during its first season it ran from to 10 p.m. ET. Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show classical musicians opera singers popular recording artists songwriters comedians ballet dancers dramatic actors performing monologues from plays and circus acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as vaudeville and although vaudeville had undergone slow demise for generation Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.Originally co-created and produced by Marlo Lewis the show was first titled Toast of the Town but was widely referred to as The Ed Sullivan Show for years before September 25 1955 when that became its official name. In the show 's June 20 1948 debut Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis performed along with singer Monica Lewis and Broadway composers Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II previewing the score to their then-new show South Pacific which opened on Broadway in 1949. From 1948 through 1962 the program 's primary sponsor was the Lincoln-Mercury Division of the Ford Motor Company Sullivan read many commercials for Mercury vehicles live on the air during this period. The Ed Sullivan Show was originally broadcast via live television from CBS-TV Studio 51 the Maxine Elliott Theatre at Broadway and 39th Street before moving to its permanent home at CBS-TV Studio 50 in New York City 1697 Broadway at 53rd Street which was renamed the Ed Sullivan Theater on the occasion of the program 's 20th anniversary in June 1968. The last original Sullivan show telecast 1068 was on March 28 1971 with guests Melanie Joanna Simon Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass and Sandler and Young. It was one of many older shows with followings in undesirable key demographics that were purged from the network lineups that summer. The purge led into the Prime Time Access Rule taking effect that fall. Repeats were scheduled through June 1971. Background Along with the new talent Sullivan booked each week he also had recurring characters appear many times season such as his Little Italian Mouse puppet sidekick Topo Gigio who debuted December 1962 and ventriloquist Señor Wences debuted December 31 1950. While most of the episodes aired live from New York City the show also aired live on occasion from other nations such as the United Kingdom Australia and Japan. For many years Ed Sullivan was national event each Sunday evening and was the first exposure for foreign performers to the American public. On the occasion of the show 's tenth anniversary telecast Sullivan commented on how the show had changed during June 1958 interview syndicated by the Newspaper Enterprise Association NEA The chief difference is mostly one of pace. In those days we had maybe six acts. Now we have 11 or 12. Then each of our acts would do leisurely ten minutes or so. Now they do two or three minutes. And in those early days talked too much. Watching these kines cringe. look up at me talking away and say You fool. Keep quiet. But just keep on talking. 've learned how to keep my mouth shut. The show enjoyed phenomenal popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. As had occurred with the annual telecasts of The Wizard of Oz in the 1960s and the 1970s the family ritual of gathering around the television set to watch Ed Sullivan became almost U.S. cultural universal. He was regarded as kingmaker and performers considered an appearance on his program as guarantee of stardom although this sometimes did not turn out to be the case. The show 's status is illustrated by the song Hymn for Sunday Evening from the 1960 musical Bye Bye Birdie. In the song family of viewers expresses their regard for the program in worshipful tones. In September 1965 CBS started televising the program in compatible color as all three major networks began to switch to 100 percent color prime time schedules. CBS had once backed its own color system developed by Peter Goldmark and resisted using RCA 's compatible process until 1954. At that time it built its first New York City color TV studio Studio 72 in former RKO movie theater at 2248 Broadway 81st Street. One Ed Sullivan Show was broadcast on August 22 1954 from the new studio but it was mostly used for one-time-only specials such as Rodgers and Hammerstein 's March 31 1957 Cinderella. The facility was later acquired by TeleTape Productions and became the first studio where the PBS children 's program Sesame Street was produced. CBS Studio 72 was demolished in 1986 and replaced by an apartment house. CBS Studio 50 was finally modernized for color broadcasts in 1965. The 1965–66 season premiere starred the Beatles in an episode airing on September 12 which was the last episode to air in black and white. This occurred because the episode was taped at the Beatles convenience on August 14 the eve of their Shea Stadium performance and two-week tour of North America slightly before the program was ready for color transmission. In the late 1960s Sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on. He realized that to keep viewers the best and brightest in entertainment had to be seen or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel. Along with declining viewership Ed Sullivan attracted higher median age for the average viewer which most sponsors found undesirable as the seasons went on. These two factors were the reason the show was cancelled by CBS on March 16 1971 as part of mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming. While Sullivan 's landmark program ended without proper finale Sullivan produced one-off specials for CBS until his death in 1974 including an Ed Sullivan Show 25th anniversary special in 1973. In 1990 television documentary producer Andrew Solt formed SOFA Entertainment Inc. and purchased the exclusive rights to the complete library of The Ed Sullivan Show from Ed Sullivan 's daughter Elizabeth and her husband Bob Precht. The collection consists of 1,087 hours of kinescopes and videotapes broadcast by CBS on Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971. Since acquiring the rights to The Ed Sullivan Show library SOFA Entertainment has catalogued organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows. Starting in 1991 SOFA Entertainment has re-introduced The Ed Sullivan Show to the American public by producing numerous network specials syndicating half-hour series that also aired on TV Land PBS VH1 and Decades and home video compilations. Some of these compilations include The Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles All Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones Elvis The Ed Sullivan Shows Motown Gold from the Ed Sullivan Show Ed Sullivan 's Rock 'n Roll Classics and 115 half-hour The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show specials among others. Performances of this show are also available as video and audio downloads and as an app on iTunes. In 2021 MeTV began airing on Sunday nights half hour packages of performances from the show. The Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra In the early years of television both CBS and NBC networks had their own symphony orchestras. NBC 's was conducted by Arturo Toscanini and CBS 's by Alfredo Antonini. The Ed Sullivan Show originally presented as The Toast Of The Town was basically musical variety show and thus members of the CBS orchestra were folded into the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra conducted by Ray Bloch. During the early days of television the demands on studio musicians were many-tiered. They needed to be proficient in all genres of music from classical to jazz and to rock and roll. The Ed Sullivan Show would regularly feature singers from the Metropolitan Opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as Eileen Farrell Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland. The musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for Ella Fitzgerald Diahann Carroll or Sammy Davis Jr. and then onto The Jackson Five Stevie Wonder or Tom Jones or Itzhak Perlman. They also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time from Gregory Hines Juliet Prowse Maria Tallchief or Margo Fonteyn to the Peter Gennaro dancers. In the process the musicians collaborated with several internationally recognized ballet troupes including Ruth Page 's Chicago Opera Ballet the London Festival Ballet Roland Petit 's Ballets de Paris and Russia 's Igor Moiseyev Ballet. Few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another. However each member of the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra was specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music. The lead trumpet player is the concert master of studio orchestra. Chris Griffin formerly with the trumpet section of Harry James Ziggy Elman and the Benny Goodman Band was Ray Bloch 's lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted including the Ed Sullivan Show. Chris remained the lead trumpet player with The Ed Sullivan show from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971. The Trumpet Section was composed of Chris Griffin Bernie Privin Jimmy Nottingham and Thad Jones. Chris son Paul Griffin was regular substitute trumpeter. Trombones Roland Dupont Morton Bullman Frank Rehak and Cliff Heather. Saxes Toots Mondello Hymie Schertzer Ed Zuhlke etc. Piano Hank Jones. Drums Specs Powell/Howard Smith. Percussion Milton Schlesinger who similarly played from the first to last show. John Serry Sr. often augmented the orchestra as the lead accordionist during the 1950s. Unlike NBC 's The Tonight Show which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in Skitch Henderson 's or Doc Severinsen 's Tonight Show Band the CBS producers of The Ed Sullivan Show decided to hide their famed musicians behind curtain. Occasionally CBS would broadcast specials and call upon the orchestra to perform. When Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated music was hastily composed for the orchestra in special tribute that also featured jazz pianist Bill Evans who had recently composed an Elegy To His Father. Notable performances and guests The Ed Sullivan Show is especially known to the World War II and baby boomer generations for introducing acts and airing breakthrough performances by popular 1950s and 1960s musicians such as Elvis Presley The Beatles The Supremes The Dave Clark Five The Animals Creedence Clearwater Revival Dusty Springfield The Beach Boys The Jackson Stevie Wonder Buddy Holly Janis Joplin The Rolling Stones The Mamas and the Papas The Lovin Spoonful Herman 's Hermits The Doors Dionne Warwick Barbra Streisand Petula Clark and The Band. The Canadian comedy duo Wayne and Shuster appeared on the program 67 times record for any performer. Bill Haley His Comets performed their hit Rock Around the Clock in early August 1955 later recognized as the first rock and roll song broadcast on national television program. Itzhak Perlman The American public 's first exposure to Itzhak Perlman was on the show in 1958 when he was 13. This performance was breakthrough not only for classical music but also for Perlman who rode the waves of admiration to new heights of fame lasting generation. Elvis Presley ==== Initial appearance ==== On September 1956 Presley made his first appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the Dorsey Brothers Milton Berle and Steve Allen even though Sullivan had vowed never to allow Presley on the show. According to Sullivan biographer Michael David Harris Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment Sullivan said that he would n't consider presenting Presley before family audience. Less than two weeks later he changed his mind and signed contract. At the time Presley was filming Love Me Tender so Sullivan 's producer Marlo Lewis flew to Los Angeles to supervise the two segments telecast that night from CBS Television City in Hollywood. Sullivan however was not able to host his show in New York City because he was recovering from near fatal automobile accident. Charles Laughton guest-hosted in Sullivan 's place and opened the show. Music journalist Greil Marcus wrote that Sullivan 's choice to have Elvis appear after Laughton 's introduction was an attempt to make Elvis less prominent in the show. For his first set Elvis played Do n't Be Cruel and Love Me Tender. According to writer Elaine Dundy Presley sang Love Me Tender straight subdued and tender ... —a very different Elvis from the one on The Steve Allen Show three months before. Elvis 's second set consisted of Ready Teddy and shortened version of Hound Dog. Popular mythology states that Sullivan censored Presley by shooting him only from the waist up but in fact Presley 's whole body was shown in the first and second shows.Although Laughton was the main star and there were seven other acts on the show Elvis was on camera for more than quarter of the time allotted to all acts. The show had 43.7 rating and was viewed by record 60,710,000 people which at the time represented an 82.6 share of the television audience and the largest single audience in television history. The latter percentage share remains to this date the largest in the history of US television. ==== Second and third appearances ==== Sullivan hosted second appearance by Presley on October 28 1956. For his first segment Elvis performed Do n't Be Cruel then Love Me Tender. For the second segment Elvis sang Love Me and for his third he sang nearly four-minute-long version of Hound Dog. For the third and final appearance on January 1957 Presley performed medley of Hound Dog Love Me Tender and Heartbreak Hotel followed by full version of Do n't Be Cruel. For second set later in the show he sang Too Much and When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again. For his last set he sang Peace in the Valley. For this third appearance it was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although much has been made of the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up except for the short section of Hound Dog all of the songs on this show were ballads.Although Sullivan praised Elvis at the end of the show Elvis claimed in 1969 interview that Sullivan had expressed very different opinion backstage Sullivan 's standing over there saying 'Sumbitch. The second and third appearances drew 57 and 54.6 million viewers respectively. Years later Sullivan tried to book Presley again but declined after Presley 's representatives presented demanding rider. The Beatles In late 1963 Sullivan and his entourage happened also to be passing through Heathrow and witnessed how the Beatles fans greeted the group on their return from Stockholm where they had performed television show as warmup band to local stars Suzie and Lill Babs. Sullivan was intrigued telling his entourage it was the same thing as Elvis all over again. He initially offered Beatles manager Brian Epstein top dollar for single show but the Beatles manager had better idea—he wanted exposure for his clients the Beatles would instead appear three times on the show for only minimal fee but receive top billing and two spots opening and closing on each show.The Beatles appeared on three consecutive Sundays in February 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as Want to Hold Your Hand had swiftly risen to No. in the charts. Their first appearance on February is considered milestone in American pop culture and furthermore the beginning of the British Invasion in music. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers record for US television at the time broken three years later by the series finale of The Fugitive. The Beatles followed Ed 's show opening intro performing All My Loving Till There Was You which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots including the famous SORRY GIRLS HE 'S MARRIED caption on John Lennon and She Loves You. The act that followed the Beatles in the broadcast magician Fred Kaps was pre-recorded in order to allow time for an elaborate set change. The group returned later in the program to perform Saw Her Standing There and Want to Hold Your Hand. The following week 's show was broadcast from Miami Beach where Cassius Clay later known as Muhammad Ali was in training for his first title bout with Sonny Liston. The occasion was used by both camps for publicity. On the evening of the television show February 16 crush of people nearly prevented the band from making it onstage. wedge of policemen were needed and the band began playing She Loves You only seconds after reaching their instruments. They continued with This Boy and All My Loving then returned later to close the show with Saw Her Standing There From Me to You and Want to Hold Your Hand. They were shown on tape February 23 this appearance had been taped earlier in the day on February before their first live appearance. They followed Ed 's intro with Twist and Shout and Please Please Me and closed the show once again with Want to Hold Your Hand. The Beatles appeared live for the final time on August 14 1965. The show was broadcast September 12 1965 and earned Sullivan 60-percent share of the nighttime audience for one of the appearances. This time they followed three acts before coming out to perform Feel Fine 'm Down and Act Naturally and then closed the show with Ticket to Ride Yesterday and Help. Although this was their final live appearance on the show the group provided filmed promotional clips of songs to air exclusively on Sullivan 's program over the next few years including videos of both Paperback Writer and Rain from 1966 and three clips from 1967 including Penny Lane Strawberry Fields Forever and Hello Goodbye. In late 1967 the group also sent telegram to Sullivan in addition to their promotional clips note which the host read live on air. The group 's last appearance on Sullivan 's program was via prerecorded promotional clips of their songs Two of Us and Let It Be broadcast on the show on the first day of March in 1970. Although both videos were recorded in late January 1969 the delay was due to the band 's dissatisfaction with the tedious Let It Be album sessions and the group 's impending break-up. In all probability the scheduling of the March 1970 broadcast was to promote the release of the band 's upcoming film Let It Be in May of that year. Black artists ==== The Supremes ==== The Supremes were special act for The Ed Sullivan Show. In addition to 14 appearances they were personal favorite of Sullivan whom he affectionately called The Girls. Over the five years they performed on the program the Supremes performed 15 of their hit singles and numerous Broadway showtunes and other non-Motown songs. The group featuring the most popular lineup of Diana Ross Mary Wilson and Florence Ballard appeared times from December 1964 through May 1967. The group reappeared on the series in October 1967 as the newly rebilled Diana Ross the Supremes with Ballard replacement Cindy Birdsong and Ross more prominently featured. The Supremes final appearance on the show shortly before it ended served as the platform to introduce America to Ross 's replacement Jean Terrell in March 1970. ==== Opportunity ==== In an era when few opportunities existed for black performers on national television Sullivan was champion of black talent. He launched the careers of many performers by presenting them to nationwide TV audience and ignored the criticism. In an NEA interview Sullivan commented The most important thing during the first ten years of the program is that we 've put on everything but bigotry. When the show first started in '48 had meeting with the sponsors. There were some Southern dealers present and they asked if intended to put on Negroes. said yes. They said should n't but convinced them was n't going to change my mind. And you know something. We 've gone over very well in the South. Never had bit of trouble. The show included entertainers such as Frankie Lymon The Supremes Marian Anderson Louis Armstrong Pearl Bailey LaVern Baker Harry Belafonte Brook Benton James Brown and The Famous Flames Cab Calloway Godfrey Cambridge Diahann Carroll Ray Charles Nat King Cole Bill Cosby Count Basie Dorothy Dandridge Sammy Davis Jr. Bo Diddley Duke Ellington Lola Falana The 5th Dimension Ella Fitzgerald The Four Tops Dick Gregory W.

Before his death in plane crash in December 1967 soul singer Otis Redding had been booked to appear on the show the following year. One telecast included African-American bass-baritone Andrew Frierson singing Ol Man River from Kern and Hammerstein 's Show Boat song that at that time was usually sung on television by white singers although it was written for black character in the musical. However Sullivan featured rockers and gave prominence to black musicians not without censorship. For instance he scheduled Fats Domino at the show 's end in case he had to cancel guest. He presented Domino alone at his piano singing as if he were young Nat 'King Cole or Fats Waller as he performed Blueberry Hill. On March 1962 Sullivan presented Domino and his band who did Jambalaya Hank Williams You Win Again and Let the Four Winds Blow. All seven of Domino 's band members were visible to millions of viewers. On December 1957 Sam Cooke performed complete version of For Sentimental Reasons. Cooke had been cut off four weeks earlier during live performance of You Send Me as the show 's allotted time expired causing an outrage among television audiences. Sullivan rebooked Cooke for the December show to overwhelming success. The Muppets Between 1966 and 1971 Jim Henson performed some of his Muppet characters on the show. The characters made total of 25 appearances. Henson 's Muppets were introduced on The Ed Sullivan Show on September 18 1966. Sullivan introduced the characters as Jim uh ... Newsom 's puppets. The act featured small ball of fur growing into the Rock and Roll Monster performed by Jim Henson Jerry Nelson and Frank Oz with three heads and six arms lip-syncing to the unreleased song Rock It to Me by The Bruthers. After the act was done the Rock and Roll Monster shrunk back into the ball of fur which is then eaten by Sour Bird who was previously used in commercial for Royal Crown Cola. Over the next few years Henson 's Muppets made more appearances with performances including The Art of Visual Thinking October 1966 remake of the skit of the same name from Sam and Friends. Kermit performed by Jim Henson teaches Grump performed by Frank Oz and voiced by Jerry Juhl about the concept of visualizing thoughts through drawings shown on the TV screen. This sketch was reprised on June 1967. Wocka'N'Roll October 1966 Joke Runner performed by Frank Oz host Segment called Wocka 'N Rolls where 2,000 Muppets Come Over Joke Runner And tell joke One By One. Monster Family October 23 1966 Fred performed by Jim Henson appears as father monster talks to his son performed by Jerry Juhl about being monster. blue version of Splurge performed by Frank Oz appears as the mother. Java November 27 1966 Two tube-like Muppets which were designed by Frank Oz dance to the Al Hirt song Java. Jim Henson and Frank Oz performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by Jerry Juhl shooting off fire extinguisher. As the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the Java music through the speakers in the elevator so he knew exactly how much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher run back to the elevator and make the trip back down to the stage just in time for the climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26 1968. The act was even done on Stuffed and Unstrung an evolved counterpart of Puppet Up. Inchworm November 27 1966 Kermit sits on wall and hums Glow Worm. Kermit also eats some worms that interrupt him. When it comes to the last one Kermit grabs it and pulls it showing how long it is until it turns out that it happens to be the nose of Big who ends up eating Kermit.

Mental illness program In 1958 NEA interview Sullivan noted his pride about the show 's role in improving the public 's understanding of mental illness. Sullivan considered his May 17 1953 telecast to be the single most important episode in the show 's first decade. During that show salute to Broadway director Joshua Logan the two men were watching in the wings and Sullivan asked Logan how he thought the show was doing. According to Sullivan Logan told him that the show was becoming another one of those and-then-I-wrote shows Sullivan asked him what he should do about it and Logan volunteered to talk about his experiences in mental institution.Sullivan took him up on the offer and in retrospect believed that several advances in the treatment of mental illness could be attributed to the resulting publicity including the repeal of Pennsylvania law about the treatment of the mentally ill and the granting of funds for the construction of new psychiatric hospitals. Film clips Occasionally Sullivan would feature Hollywood actor introducing clip from film in which he or she currently starred. Burt Lancaster made an appearance in 1962 speaking about Robert Stroud the character he portrayed in Birdman of Alcatraz and introducing clip from the film. And although Sir Laurence Olivier personally did not appear on the show in 1966 Sullivan showed clip from the Olivier Othello the film version of which was then currently showing in New York City. Controversies Bo Diddley On November 20 1955 African American rock 'n roll singer and guitarist Bo Diddley appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show only to infuriate Sullivan did two songs and he got mad. Diddley had been asked to sing Tennessee Ernie Ford 's hit Sixteen Tons which he agreed. But while the show was on air he changed his mind and sang Diddley Daddy. reporter who was present at the time described what happened Controversy raged for over an hour backstage at CBS Studios 57 last Sunday immediately following Ed Sullivan signon on his coast to coast television show Toast of the Town. In verbal battle which started over one of the performers refusal to do number on the telecast which Sullivan had requested. During the dress rehearsal Bo Diddley listed as number seven in the lineups of stars participating in the show agreed to do 16 Tons as Marlo Lewis Toast of the Town Executive Producer and Sullivan had requested. However at 8:39 PM as Sullivan went into his commercial the folk singer hurried to the side of Ray Block musical director to announce that he had changed his mind and was going to do Diddley Daddy. After several attempts to get him to change his mind CBS brass went into hurried conference in an attempt to synchronize the timing of the show with longer number. The final result of this conference was the cutting of two acts which preceded Bo Diddley number. Following the act in where Willis Jackson band leaded played his saxophone barefooted. Sullivan and disk jockey Tommy Smalls manager of the act got into heated argument backstage. By the time John Wray Executive Director had taken the show off the air Bo Diddley Smalls his agent Lewis Ray Block and several members of the band had instituted series of verbal attack on the change in programming. Bo Diddley stated backed by Smalls that he had switched from 16 Tons to Diddley Daddy because the latter had made him juke box favorite and people from coast-to-coast were expecting him to perform the number. Sullivan and Lewis maintained that he should have notified them of the change before air time instead of after the show was in progress. In his biography Living Legend Diddley recalled Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words 'You are the first black boy—quote—that ever double crossed me. was ready to fight because was little young dude off the streets of Chicago an him callin me 'black in them days was as bad as sayin 'nigger. My manager says to me 'That 's Mr. Sullivan. said do n't give shit about Mr. Sullivan do n't talk to me like that. An so he told me he says 'll see that you never work no more in show business. You 'll never get another TV show in your life. Diddley perennial revisions make it difficult to determine exactly what happened but the guitarist never did appear on The Ed Sullivan Show again. As for Sullivan 's racist comment it is hard to know what he actually said. However he always seemed supportive of blacks not only as entertainers he produced black vaudeville show early in his career but also for their church-bred conservative beliefs that conformed to the values he wanted the show to reflect. In Living Legend Diddley boasts of being the first black person to be on The Ed Sullivan Show but Sullivan had in fact had black guests as early as 1948. Black celebrities who appeared prior to Diddley include Fletcher Henderson Ethel Waters Billy Eckstine Pearl Bailey the Ink Spots Sarah Vaughan Sammy Davis Jr. Jackie Robinson Lena Horne Joe Louis Eartha Kitt Sugar Ray Robinson and the Harlem Globetrotters. Nat King Cole was frequent guest who had appeared few weeks prior to Diddley. Short Vision On May 27 1956 The Ed Sullivan Show presented an animated short film entitled Short Vision. The short subject showcased an unidentified object that is referred to as it by the narrator. The object flies over Earth. When it passes the people are asleep except the leaders and the wise men who look up at the object. As the leaders and wise men look up and predators and prey hide in fear it produces mushroom cloud in the sky killing everyone and everything vaporizing the people the animals and Earth. After this happens there remains only moth and flame. The moth flies to the flame gets vaporized and the flame dies. Thus marking the end of humanity. The short film is narrated in the style of the Bible. The animation is derived from mostly still images that produce terrifying and horrifying moving image of the end of humanity. Just before CBS showed the film Sullivan assured children that what they would see was an animated fantasy. He told the audience that It is grim but think we can all stand it to realize that in war there is no winner. The film gained notoriety from the show but it also gained controversy because of it due to the graphic way it depicted the horrors of nuclear confrontation. Its graphic images also caused controversy. One of the visuals in the film depicted an animated character 's eyes imploding and the remains running down its cheeks and then it gets destroyed by the object. According to some sources including contemporary newspaper reports Ed Sullivan 's telecast of Short Vision caused reaction as significant as Orson Welles The War of the Worlds radio broadcast 20 years prior. Because of the popularity of the short film The Ed Sullivan Show broadcast it again on June 10 of the same year. Sullivan—who in an interview after the first showing erroneously claimed that he had warned children to not watch it—asked adults to remove children from the room before watching the second heavily publicized showing. Buddy Holly and the Crickets On January 26 1958 for their second appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show Buddy Holly and The Crickets were scheduled to perform two songs. Sullivan wanted the band to substitute different song for their record hit Oh Boy. which he felt was too raucous. Holly had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing Oh Boy. for them and told Sullivan as much. During the afternoon the Crickets were summoned to rehearsal at short notice but only Holly was in their dressing room. When asked where the others were Holly replied do n't know. No telling. Sullivan then turned to Holly and said guess The Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show to which Holly caustically replied hope they 're damn more excited than am. Sullivan already bothered by the choice of songs was now even angrier. He cut the Crickets act from two songs to one and when introducing them mispronounced Holly 's name so it came out vaguely as Hollett or Holland. In addition Sullivan saw to it that the microphone for Holly 's electric guitar was turned off. Holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could and repeatedly trying to turn up the volume on his guitar. For the instrumental break he cut loose with dramatic solo making clear to the audience that the technical fault was not his. The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for third appearance. Holly 's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan. Jackie Mason On October 18 1964 Jackie Mason allegedly gave Sullivan the finger on air. tape of the incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know by pointing two fingers that he had only two minutes left as CBS was about to cut away to show speech by President Lyndon Johnson. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage the camera then cut to visibly angry Sullivan.Sullivan argued with Mason backstage then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger and Mason later claimed that he had never even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation to protect the perceived threat to his career Mason filed libel suit at the New York Supreme Court which he won.Sullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later in 1966. At that time Mason opened his monologue by saying It 's great thrill and fantastic opportunity to see me in person again and impersonated Sullivan during his act. Mason later appeared on the show five times April 23 1967 Feb. 25 1968 Nov. 24 1968 Jul. 22 1969 and Aug. 31 1969. Bob Dylan Bob Dylan was slated to make his first nationwide television appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show on May 12 1963 and intended to perform Talkin John Birch Paranoid Blues song he wrote lampooning the John Birch Society and the red-hunting paranoia associated with it. Although Sullivan reportedly liked the song during the afternoon rehearsal that day CBS officials told Dylan they had deemed the song unacceptable for broadcast and wanted him to substitute another. No this is what want to do Dylan responded. If ca n't play my song 'd rather not appear on the show. He then left the studio rather than altering the act with Sullivan respecting his decision. The Doors The Doors were notorious for their appearance on the show. CBS network censors demanded that before the band performed the song on-camera on September 17 1967 Since the beginning of the fall 1966 television season the show had been recorded on color videotape few hours before its 8:00 pm Eastern Standard Time time slot. Performers and their managers were told that the show must proceed as if it were being done live and videotape editing on short notice was impossible lead singer Jim Morrison change the lyrics to their hit single Light My Fire by altering the line Girl we could n't get much higher as they were uncomfortable with the possible reference to drugs. During the rehearsal Morrison sang the alternate line which was either Girl we could n't get much better or Girl there 's nothing require depending on the source. However he reverted to the original line during the show and CBS executives were powerless to change it because the nature of videotape editing in 1967 required many hours of labor. The Doors were never invited back to the show. According to Ray Manzarek the band was told Mr. Sullivan liked you boys. He wanted you on six more times. ... You 'll never do the Sullivan show again. Morrison replied with glee Hey man we just did the Sullivan show. —at the time an appearance was hallmark of success. Manzarek has given differing accounts of what happened. He has said that the band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident were reenacted in Oliver Stone 's 1991 biographical film The Doors albeit in more dramatic fashion with Morrison portrayed as emphasizing the word higher .Sullivan apparently felt the damage had been done and relented on bands using the word higher. Sly the Family Stone later appeared on the show and performed their 1969 hit Want to Take You Higher. The Rolling Stones In contrast the Rolling Stones were instructed to change the title of their Let 's Spend the Night Together single for the band 's January 15 1967 appearance. The band complied with Mick Jagger and Bill Wyman ostentatiously rolling their eyes heavenward whenever they reached the song 's one-night-only clean refrain Let 's spend 'some time together. Mick Jagger did not wear jacket on their first appearance on the show October 25 1964 and this annoyed Sullivan. They were asked to appear again but they were asked to wear jackets for their 1965 appearance. The Stones ultimately played on the Ed Sullivan Show six times.

A Time for Choosing,Time for Choosing also known as The Speech was speech presented during the 1964 U.S. presidential election campaign by future president Ronald Reagan on behalf of Republican candidate Barry Goldwater. Time For Choosing launched Reagan into national prominence in politics.,Time for Choosing also known as The Speech was speech presented during the 1964 U.S. presidential election campaign by future president Ronald Reagan on behalf of Republican candidate Barry Goldwater. Time For Choosing launched Reagan into national prominence in politics. Background Many versions of this speech exist since it was altered over many weeks. Contrary to popular belief however the speech was not given at the 1964 Republican National Convention in San Francisco California as nomination speech for presidential candidate Senator Barry Goldwater Everett Dirksen gave that nomination speech while Richard Nixon introduced Goldwater prior to his acceptance speech. Reagan though he campaigned for Goldwater did not use Time for Choosing until October 27 1964 when it was part of pre-recorded television program Rendezvous with Destiny. The title of the program was used by Franklin D. Roosevelt in his June 27 1936 speech to the 1936 Democratic National Convention. In his autobiography An American Life Reagan recalled going to bed that night hoping had n't let Barry down. Speaking for Goldwater Reagan stressed his belief in the importance of smaller government. In the speech Reagan revealed his ideological motivation The Founding Fathers knew government ca n't control the economy without controlling people. And they knew when government sets out to do that it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. So we have come to time for choosing. He also said You and are told we must choose between left or right but suggest there is no such thing as left or right. There is only an up or down. Up to man 's age-old dream the maximum of individual freedom consistent with law and order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. The speech raised million for Goldwater 's campaign and is considered the event that launched Reagan 's political career. Aftermath Time For Choosing has been considered one of the most effective speeches ever made by an eventual presidential candidate. Following Time For Choosing in 1964 Washington Post Reporter David S. Broder called the speech the most successful national political debut since William Jennings Bryan electrified the 1896 Democratic Convention with his Cross of Gold speech. Nevertheless Barry Goldwater lost the election by one of the largest margins in history. Soon afterward Reagan was asked to run for Governor of California he ran for office and won the election in 1966. When Reagan won the White House in 1980 George Will of the Washington Post referred back to Time For Choosing and said Goldwater won the election of 1964.. . it just took sixteen years to count the votes. In 2014 Professor Steven F. Hayward Professor of Public Policy at Pepperdine University and Reagan biographer looked back at the speech and said at the time critics thought the speech was too emotional while others thought it was too controversial. But after the speech it was clear that Ronald Reagan and his ideas were simply irresistible. Time For Choosing ushered in conservative movement in American Politics at time when the country was looking for strong leadership following President Kennedy 's Assassination growing welfare state and raging Cold War. Reagan 's speech in 1964 not only made him the leader of this movement but also earned him the nickname The Great Communicator in recognition of his effective oratory skills.

Captain Aardvark,Captain Aarfy Aardvark is fictional character in the 1961 novel Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. Aarfy is the plump navigator in Yossarian 's B-25 noted for being oblivious to incoming flak getting lost on missions and his omnipresent pipe. His nickname Aarfy is an abbreviation of his surname Aardvark.,Captain Aarfy Aardvark is fictional character in the 1961 novel Catch-22 by Joseph Heller. Aarfy is the plump navigator in Yossarian 's B-25 noted for being oblivious to incoming flak getting lost on missions and his omnipresent pipe. His nickname Aarfy is an abbreviation of his surname Aardvark. Character sketch Motivation Aarfy is social climber looking to work his way up into high society. Goal Aarfy befriends Nately because Nately 's father is rich and he hopes to work for him after the war. Aarfy perceives himself as moral and protects well-connected women from the sexual advances of other officers looking for any possibility of self-advance within society. Old Aarfy has never paid for it he often says in reference to prostitutes. He often and openly commits rape and says he can tell which girl is nice and clean and which is n't. Relationships and conflict Yossarian is constantly infuriated by Aarfy during missions who appears to have no fear of flak and always gets in Yossarian 's way when he is trying to get back to the escape hatch away from the bombardier position in the nose.Aarfy tries to be friends with Nately in the hope that his father will give Aarfy an important job after the war for this service. Nately realizes that Aarfy is climber though and sees the other officers more as his friends. Aarfy helps to protect women with social connections from the sexual advances of the other officers much to their dismay hoping that these connections will later be of use. Unlike the other officers Aarfy is not willing to pay for sex with prostitute but perversely he has no regrets when he rapes and murders the innocent maid Michaela when asked by Yossarian why he did n't simply hire prostitute he repeats his common admonition that Old Aarfy has never paid for it and shows no remorse. Epiphany When Yossarian starts to convince Aarfy that he will have to pay for the rape and murder of Michaela for the first time in the novel he loses his composure and shows fear. His fear is not realized though as when the police arrive they instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL and not Aarfy. His reprehensible actions are therefore vindicated and he can be satisfied that the system is there to protect him. Biographical summary Actions in Catch-22 ==== On mission ==== During dangerous missions Yossarian always shouts at Aarfy to get out of the way so he can get to the escape hatch. Aarfy always replies that he can not hear him infuriating Yossarian even more and no matter how loud Yossarian shouts Aarfy never can hear him except when he says never mind. On one mission Yossarian gets so upset he punches Aarfy but to no effect as his body fat absorbs all the blows. Yossarian 's frustration with Aarfy is never vented and he always gives up leaving Aarfy to carry on regardless. He nearly gets himself and his comrades killed several times while getting lost on mission Over Ferrara when Yossarian went round second time to bomb the bridge and Kraft and his plane 's crew were killed. On milk run to Parma where Aarfy led the planes over the city of Livorno and Yossarian got hit in the leg by flak. With Colonel Cathcart where the plane almost got shot down.Aarfy is so heedless of his own personal safety and the well-being of others that it always astounds him when they become angry at him. ==== Social climbing ==== Aarfy throughout the novel tries to befriend Nately as means of getting in favor with his wealthy father he had already fallen truly in love with Nately 's father and the prospect of working for him after the war in some executive capacity as reward for befriending Nately. The irony is that Nately actually sees his friends as Yossarian Orr Hungry Joe and Dunbar whom his parents would not be impressed with but equally his parents would not like Aarfy whom they would see as climber. The girls upstairs and the cameo woman protects them from the sexual advances of the officers not for his own pleasure but because he sees them as women connected to important men who could help him out after the war. ==== Fraternity life ==== Aarfy views women as purely means to an end whether it is for sex or for social connections. He advises Nately that if he wants to keep his prostitute in the apartment in Rome one night then pay for them to stay till after curfew and then they will be obliged to stay and do what ever they want. He gives an example when he has done this before in his fraternity days remember one day we tricked two dumb high-school girls from town into the fraternity house and made them put out for all the fellows there who wanted them by threatening to call up their parents and say they were putting out for us. We kept them trapped in bed for more than ten hours. We even smacked their faces little when they started to complain. Then we took away their nickels and dimes and chewing gum and threw them out. ==== Michaela ==== Toward the end of the novel Aarfy rapes and murders maid Michaela while on leave in Rome. This inadvertently forms the emotional center of the novel. When an aghast Yossarian tells him that he will be arrested and possibly executed Aarfy laughs dismissively that no one would do that to good old Aarfy But only raped her once. he explained. Yossarian was aghast. But you killed her Aarfy. You killed her. Oh had to do that after had raped her Aarfy replied in his most condescending manner. could n't very well let her go around saying bad things about us could. But why did you have to touch her at all you dumb bastard. Yossarian shouted. Why could n't you get yourself girl off the street if you wanted one. The city is full of prostitutes. Oh no not me Aarfy bragged. never paid for it in my life. His insouciant view is vindicated when the police arriving on the scene show no interest in Aarfy and instead arrest Yossarian for going AWOL. Major themes Catch-22 Yossarian 's frustration with Aarfy during missions is analogous to his frustration with Catch-22 whereby no matter how loud he shouts or hard he fights he can not affect Aarfy who carries on regardless. Similarly one can not fight Catch-22. Aarfy 's character exemplifies the perversity of society and culture governed by Catch-22s that ultimately serve to protect the powerful. Other more considerate members of the squadron suffer ignominious or horrible fates while he—merely oblivious and inconsiderate for most of the novel—faces no negative consequences even when his self-absorption drives him to murder. In his reactions to flak and to rape and murder Aarfy demonstrates complete insanity. Hence he survives and prospers in completely insane world. Attitude towards women Unlike the other officers most notably Yossarian and Hungry Joe Aarfy does not outwardly show any signs of lust in the novel. He generally sees women as objects of distaste as in the prostitutes the officers pay for or as means for social climbing. Although he believes that he is showing them due courtesy he is not actually respecting these women for who they are but just using them as means to an end. Portrayals In Mike Nichols 1970 film adaptation of the novel Aarfy is played by Charles Grodin. In the 2019 Hulu miniseries he is played by Rafi Gavron. References.

Commentators have said that his legacy pushed Japan towards more proactive military spending security and economic policies. Early life Family Shinzo Abe was born on 21 September 1954 to prominent political family in Shinjuku Tokyo. Although as boy he aspired to become filmmaker Abe 's family history led him upon political path. His father Shintaro Abe served in the House of Representatives from 1958 to 1991 with stints as Chief Cabinet Secretary Minister for International Trade and Industry and Minister for Foreign Affairs. During World War II Shintaro volunteered to be kamikaze pilot but the war ended before he completed training.Abe 's maternal grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was the de facto economic king of occupied China and Manchukuo Japanese puppet state in Northern China established after the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in the lead-up to the Second Sino-Japanese War and World War II. During the war Kishi served as Vice Minister of Munitions in the cabinet of Prime Minister Hideki Tojo. At the end of the war Kishi was imprisoned as suspected Class-A war criminal by the US military occupation of Japan but was released and later de-purged as part of the Occupation 's reverse course due to the Cold War. Kishi helped found the Liberal Democratic Party LDP in 1955 and served as Prime Minister of Japan from 1957 until his 1960 resignation following the Anpo protests. The BBC speculated that Abe 's aversion to protests may have originated as result. Abe viewed Kishi as his No role model and was influenced by many of his beliefs like Kishi 's hawkish stance on Communist China. Regarding Kishi Abe later wrote Some people used to point to my grandfather as 'Class-A war criminal suspect and felt strong repulsion. Because of that experience may have become emotionally attached to 'conservatism on the contrary .Abe 's paternal grandfather Kan Abe was Yamaguchi landowner who served in the House of Representatives during World War II. In contrast to Kishi Kan Abe was stalwart pacifist who opposed the Tojo government and war in East Asia. Education and early career Abe attended Seikei Elementary School and Seikei Junior and Senior High School 成蹊中学校・高等学校. He studied public administration and graduated with bachelor 's degree in political science from Seikei University in 1977. From 1978 to 1979 Abe attended the University of Southern California where he studied English as visiting student. After taking courses in history international relations and political science for three semesters Abe left. Abe is reported to have been an average student.In April 1979 Abe began working for Kobe Steel. He left the company in 1982 and pursued number of government positions including executive assistant to the Minister for Foreign Affairs private secretary to the chairperson of the LDP General Council and private secretary to the LDP secretary-general. Abe worked as secretary for his father who visited 81 countries in the 1980s. These travels imparted to Abe the importance of building relations with foreign leaders. Member of the House of Representatives Abe was elected to the first district of Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1993 after his father 's 1991 death winning the most votes of the four Representatives elected in the SNTV multi-member district. In 1999 he became Director of the Social Affairs Division. He was Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary in the Yoshirō Mori and Junichiro Koizumi Cabinets from 2000 to 2003 after which he was appointed Secretary-General of the Liberal Democratic Party. Abe was member of the Mori Faction formally the Seiwa Seisaku Kenkyū-kai of the Liberal Democratic Party. This faction is headed by former prime minister Yoshirō Mori. Junichiro Koizumi was member of the Mori Faction but left it as is the custom when accepting high party post. From 1986 to 1991 Abe 's father Shintaro headed the same faction. In 2000 Abe 's home and the office of his supporters in Shimonoseki in Yamaguchi Prefecture were attacked with Molotov cocktails on numerous occasions. The perpetrators were several Yakuza members belonging to the Kudo-kai Kitakyushu-based designated boryokudan syndicate. The reason for the attacks was believed to be that Abe 's local aide refused to give cash to Shimonoseki real estate broker in return for supporting Shimonoseki mayoral candidate in 1999.Abe was the chief negotiator for the Japanese government on behalf of the families of Japanese abductees taken to North Korea. As part of the effort he accompanied Koizumi to meet Kim Jong‑il in 2002. He gained national popularity when he demanded that Japanese abductees visiting Japan remain in the country in defiance of North Korea.He was the leader of project team within the LDP that conducted survey on excessive sexual education and gender-free education. Among the items to which this team raised objections were anatomical dolls and other curricular materials not taking into consideration the age of children school policies banning traditional boys and girls festivals and mixed-gender physical education. The team sought to provide contrast to the Democratic Party of Japan DPJ which it alleged supported such policies.On 23 April 2006 Abe was elected as the president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. His chief competitors for the position were Sadakazu Tanigaki and Tarō Asō. Yasuo Fukuda was leading early contender but ultimately chose not to run. Former prime minister Yoshirō Mori to whose faction both Abe and Fukuda belonged stated that the faction strongly leant toward Abe. First term as prime minister 2006–2007 Inauguration and cabinet On 26 September 2006 Abe was inaugurated as Japanese prime minister. Elected at age 52 he was the youngest prime minister since Fumimaro Konoe in 1941. He was also the first prime minister born after World War II. Abe 's first cabinet was announced on 26 September 2006. The only minister retained in his position from the previous Koizumi cabinet was Foreign Minister Tarō Asō who had been one of Abe 's competitors for the LDP presidency. In addition to the cabinet positions existing under Koizumi Abe created five new advisor positions. He reshuffled his cabinet on 27 August 2007. Commentators noted that these changes seemed to effort by Abe to organize the Prime Minister 's office into something more akin to the White House.The New York Times noted that his cabinet appeared to place larger emphasis on foreign policy and national security instead of domestic concerns like economic policy. It also speculated that Abe 's primary goal may have been to revise the pacifist constitution. Domestic policy Abe expressed general commitment to the reforms instituted by his predecessor Junichiro Koizumi. He took some steps toward balancing the Japanese budget such as appointing tax policy expert Kōji Omi as Minister of Finance. Omi previously supported increases in the national consumption tax although Abe distanced himself from this policy and sought to achieve much of his budget-balancing through spending cuts.Since 1997 as the bureau chief of the Institute of Junior Assembly Members Who Think About the Outlook of Japan and History Education Abe supported the controversial Japanese Society for History Textbook Reform and the New History Textbook. In March 2007 Abe along with right-wing politicians proposed bill to encourage nationalism and love for one 's country and hometown among the Japanese youth specific wording from the revised Fundamental Law of Education 教育基本法 which was revised to include love of country .In March 2007 Abe stated that there was no evidence that the Japanese military had forced women into sexual slavery during World War II which the Japanese government had admitted and apologized for in the 1992 Kono Statement. Responding to potential motion by the US Congress encouraging Japan to acknowledge the atrocity Abe stated that the Japanese government would not apologize again.Abe held conservative views in the Japanese succession controversy and shortly after the birth of Prince Hisahito of Akishino he abandoned proposed legislative amendment to permit women to inherit the Chrysanthemum Throne. Foreign policy ==== North Korea ==== Abe generally took hard-line stance on North Korea especially regarding the North Korean abductions of Japanese citizens.In 2002 negotiations between Japan and North Korea Prime Minister Koizumi and general secretary Kim Jong-il agreed to give abductees permission to visit Japan. few weeks into the visit the Japanese government decided that the abductees would be restricted from returning to North Korea where their families live. Abe took credit for this policy decision in his bestselling book Towards Beautiful Nation 美しい国へ Utsukushii kuni. North Korea criticized this Japanese decision as breach of diplomatic promise and the negotiations were aborted. ==== East and Southeast Asia ==== Abe publicly recognized the need for improved relations with the People 's Republic of China PRC and along with Foreign Minister Tarō Asō sought an eventual summit meeting with former PRC paramount leader Hu Jintao. Abe also said that China–Japan relations should not continue to be based on emotions .Abe was respected among some politicians in the Republic of China ROC Taiwan most notably those who are part of the Pan-Green Coalition seeking Taiwanese independence. Chen Shui-bian welcomed Abe 's ministership. Part of Abe 's appeal in Taiwan was historical his grandfather Nobusuke Kishi was an anti-communist who supported Chiang Kai-shek 's government after the government retreated to the island and his great-uncle Eisaku Satō was the last prime minister to visit Taiwan while in office.Abe expressed the need to strengthen political security and economic ties with Southeast Asian countries. Although the PRC is not within the Southeast Asian region Japan has also sought its support. However relations with the PRC and the ROC continue to be tarnished by the Senkaku Islands dispute and Abe 's visits to the Yasukuni Shrine. ==== India ==== Abe in his four terms as the prime minister of Japan sought to upgrade the strategic Japan–India relationship. Abe initiated the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue between Japan the United States Australia and India in 2007. His three-day visit to India in August 2007 inaugurated new bilateral Asian alliance building on the long history of friendly bilateral relations between India and Japan. Abe 's initiative was to establish the fifth bilateral link in an emerging scenario whereby the US–Australia US–Japan Japan–Australia and the US–India links are supportive strategic alignments. sixth link of India-Australia would be the logical corollary formalized as new quadrilateral of strategic bulwark. The eventual expansion to include Vietnam South Korea the Philippines and Indonesia in this arrangement has been speculated in the media of those states. Chinese strategic experts have labeled the evolving geo-strategic paradigm the Asian NATO. Abe 's pragmatic India foreign policy was to boost Japan 's resurgent economic indicators while gaining crucial partner in Asia. Defense Abe sought to revise or broaden the interpretation of Article of the Japanese Constitution in order to permit Japan to maintain de jure military forces. He stated that we are reaching the limit in narrowing down differences between Japan 's security and the interpretation of our constitution. During his first period as prime minister he upgraded the Japan Defense Agency to full ministry status. Like his predecessors he supported the Japanese alliance with the United States. Abe supported the US-led war in Iraq. Resignation In the leadup to the July election Abe 's Agriculture Minister Toshikatsu Matsuoka committed suicide following series of political funding scandals. He was the first cabinet member to commit suicide since World War II. Abe 's ruling Liberal Democratic Party suffered great losses in the upper house election losing control for the first time in 52 years. Agricultural minister Norihiko Akagi involved in political funding scandal resigned after the election. Additionally Abe 's rejection of possible female Japanese monarch which led to the Japanese succession controversy diminished his support base.In an attempt to revive his administration Abe announced new cabinet in August 2007. Support for Abe rose by 10 percent as result. However the new agricultural minister Takehiko Endo involved in finance scandal resigned only seven days later.On 12 September 2007 only three days after new parliamentary session had begun Abe announced his intention to resign his position as prime minister at an unscheduled press conference. The announcement came just minutes before opposition leaders were scheduled to question him in Parliament and shocked many. Abe had described himself as politician who fights and previously pledged not to resign. Abe explained that his unpopularity was hindering the passage of an anti-terrorism law involving among other things Japan 's continued military presence in Afghanistan. Party officials also said the embattled prime minister was suffering from poor health.Abe remained in the National Diet following his resignation as prime minister. He was re-elected to his Yamaguchi 4th district seat in the 2009 election when the Liberal Democratic Party lost power to the DPJ. While serving as member of the Japanese Diet Abe visited Taiwan in 2010 and 2011. There he met with president Ma Ying-jeou former president Lee Teng-hui and future president Tsai Ing-wen who was then the leader of the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party. Ma described Abe as the ROC 's best friend and said Abe was the third generation of his family to have close ties with the Republic of China. Abe also visited the National Revolutionary Martyrs Shrine shrine dedicated to the war dead of the Republic of China including those who died in the Second Sino-Japanese War.Abe later revealed that the illness that contributed to ending his first term as prime minister was ulcerative colitis but that he recovered due to access to drug Asacol that was previously unavailable in Japan. Second LDP presidency and 2012 general election Following the resignation of LDP president Sadakazu Tanigaki Abe was re-elected as president of the party on 26 September 2012 coming in second out of five candidates in the first round of voting but defeating former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba in runoff vote by 108 votes to 89.Abe returned to the LDP leadership at time of political turmoil as the governing DPJ had lost its majority in the lower house due to party splits over nuclear policies and the cabinet 's move to raise the consumption tax from to 10 percent. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda was forced to rely on the LDP to pass the consumption tax bill and in return was pressured by Abe and the opposition parties to hold snap general election. Noda agreed to this on the conditions that the LDP passed bond-financing bill and would support commission to reform the social security system and address electoral malapportionment in the next diet session.On 16 November 2012 Prime Minister Noda announced the dissolution of the lower house and that the general election would be held on 16 December. Abe campaigned using the slogan Nippon Torimodosu Take back Japan promising economic revival through monetary easing higher public spending and the continued use of nuclear energy and tough line in territorial disputes.In the elections on 16 December 2012 the LDP won 294 seats in the 480-seat House of Representatives. Together with the New Komeito Party which partnered with the LDP since the late 1990s Abe was able to form coalition government that controlled two-thirds majority in the lower house allowing it to override the upper house 's veto. Second term as prime minister 2012–2014 On 26 December 2012 Abe was formally elected as prime minister by the Diet with the support of 328 out of 480 members of the House of Representatives. He and his second cabinet which he called crisis-busting cabinet were sworn in later that day. The new government included LDP heavyweights such as former prime minister Tarō Asō as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Yoshihide Suga as Chief Cabinet Secretary and Akira Amari as Economy Minister. Following his victory Abe said With the strength of my entire cabinet will implement bold monetary policy flexible fiscal policy and growth strategy that encourages private investment and with these three policy pillars achieve results. In February 2013 Abe gave an address at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Washington D.C. in which he explained his economic and diplomatic objectives and that he had returned to the prime ministership to prevent Japan becoming Tier Two Nation declaring that Japan is back. Economic policy The Second Abe cabinet revived the Council on Economic and Fiscal Policy CEFP that had played key role in formulating economic policy during the Koizumi cabinet but had been abandoned by the 2009–2012 DPJ administrations.Abe declared in his January 2013 policy speech to the Diet that economic revival and escaping deflation was the greatest and urgent issue facing Japan. His economic strategy referred to as Abenomics consisted of the so-called three arrows an allusion to an old Japanese story of policy. The first arrow was monetary expansion aimed at achieving inflation target the second flexible fiscal policy to act as an economic stimulus in the short term then achieve budget surplus and the third growth strategy focusing on structural reform and private sector investment to achieve long-term growth.In 2019 it was reported that 40 of key economic statistics collected from 2005 to 2017 contained errors casting doubt on the effectiveness of Abe 's economic program and the reliability of Japanese economic statistics. It was discovered that the labor ministry did not follow protocol by only surveying about one-third of all the large Japanese businesses it was supposed to survey. The data was eventually corrected and it was discovered that the faulty data presented Japanese economic statistics more favorably than the corrected data. The faulty data costed 19.7 million people about 53.7 billion yen in unpaid benefits and costed the Japanese government 650 million yen to correct the error. Opposition politicians criticized the governments response one lawmaker called Abe 's economic program fraud with many journalists labeling the event as data scandal. ==== First Arrow Monetary policy ==== At the first CEFP meeting in January 2013 Abe declared that the Bank of Japan should follow policy of monetary easing to achieve target of percent inflation. Abe maintained pressure on the Bank 's governor Masaaki Shirakawa who was reluctant to set specific targets into agreeing to the policy. In February after Abe publicly speculated that the government could legislate to strip the bank of independence Shirakawa announced he was leaving office prematurely before his term expired. Abe then appointed Haruhiko Kuroda as governor who had previously advocated inflation targets and who has pursued the government 's policies of monetary easing.After the first meeting of the Bank 's monetary policy committee after he had taken office in April Kuroda announced an aggressive program of easing intended to double the money supply and achieve the percent inflation target at the earliest possible time. Over the first six months of the second Abe Cabinet the Yen fell from high of ¥77 to the dollar to ¥101.8 and the Nikkei 225 rose by 70 percent.In surprise move in October 2014 Kuroda announced that the BOJ would boost the monetary easing program and accelerate asset purchases the monetary policy committee split by five votes to four but supported the policy. This was interpreted as response to disappointing economic figures in the aftermath of the increase in the consumption tax to percent inflation has fallen to percent from its peak of 1.5 percent in April. ==== Second Arrow Fiscal policy ==== The Abe Cabinet 's first budget included 10.3 trillion yen stimulus package composed of public works spending aid for small businesses and investment incentives that aimed to increase growth by percent. The budget also increased defense spending and manpower while reducing foreign aid.In Autumn 2013 Abe decided to proceed with the first stage of the increase in the consumption tax from to percent in April 2014 with second stage envisaged raising it to 10 percent in October 2015. The bill to raise the tax had been passed under the previous DPJ government but the final decision lay with the Prime Minister. He and Finance Minister Tarō Asō explained that the tax would be increased to provide sustainable basis for future social spending and to avoid the need to finance future stimulus by issuing government bonds. While this was expected to affect economic growth in the quarter following the rise Abe also announced 5-trillion yen stimulus package that aimed to mitigate any effects on economic revival. After the increase in April Japan fell into recession during the second and third quarters of 2014 leading to Abe delaying the second stage of the tax rise until April 2017 and calling snap election see below. In response to the recession Aso announced that the government would ask the Diet to pass supplementary budget to fund further stimulus package worth 2–3 trillion yen.There had been some division within the Abe cabinet between fiscal hawks such as Finance Minister Aso who favored fiscal consolidation through spending cuts and tax increases and deflationists such as Abe himself who argued in favor of growth first policy that prioritizes economic expansion and recovery over budget considerations using the slogan no fiscal health without economic revitalization. Abe 's decision to delay the consumption tax increase in November 2014 and his push for large fiscal deficit in the 2015 budget without social security cuts was interpreted as victory for this faction within the LDP. The government did however commit to primary surplus by 2020 and pledged to review its strategy in 2018 if the primary deficit had not fallen to percent of GDP by that time. ==== Third Arrow Growth strategy and structural reform ==== On 15 March 2013 Abe announced that Japan was entering negotiations to join the Trans-Pacific Partnership TPP. This was interpreted by analysts as means through which the government could enact reforms to liberalize certain sectors of the Japanese economy most notably agriculture and was criticized by farm lobbies and some sections of the LDP. Economist Yoshizaki Tatsuhiko described the TPP as having the potential to act as the linchpin of Abe 's economic revitalization strategy by making Japan more competitive through free trade. In February 2015 the Abe government struck deal to limit the power of the JA-Zenchu body to supervise and audit Japan 's agricultural co-operatives in move designed to facilitate TPP negotiations improve the competitiveness of Japan 's farming sector and curtail the influence of the agriculture lobby.Abe revealed the first measures related to the third arrow policies in June 2013 which included plans to establish deregulated economic zones and allow the sale of drugs online but did not include substantial measures related to the labor market or business reform. These measures were less well-received than the first two arrows had been since Abe took office with the stock market falling slightly and critics arguing that they lacked detail The Economist for example judged the announcement misfire. Analysts did note however that Abe was waiting until after the July Upper House elections to reveal further details to avoid an adverse reaction by voters to potentially unpopular reforms. At the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum WEF in Davos in 2014 Abe announced that he was ready to act as drill bit to break through the rock of vested interests and red tape to achieve structural reforms of the economy. He cited reforms in agriculture energy and health sectors as evidence of this and pledged to push forward with the TPP Japan–EU trade deal and tax corporate governance and planning reforms.Abe announced package of structural reforms in June 2014 that The Economist described as less single arrow than 1,000-strong bundle and compared favorably to the 2013 announcement. These new measures included corporate governance reform the easing of restrictions on hiring foreign staff in special economic zones liberalizing the health sector and measures to help foreign and local entrepreneurs. The plans also included cut in corporation tax to below 30 percent an expansion of childcare to encourage women to join the workforce and the loosening of restrictions on overtime. In December 2015 the government announced corporation tax would be reduced to 29.97 percent in 2016 bringing the cut forward one year ahead of schedule. In September 2013 Abe called for society in which all women can shine setting target that 30 percent of leadership positions should be held by women by 2020. Abe cited the womenomics ideas of Kathy Matsui that greater participation by women in the workforce which is relatively low in Japan especially in leadership roles could improve Japan 's GDP and potentially fertility rates despite declining population figures. The Abe cabinet introduced measures to expand childcare and legislation to force public and private organizations to publish data on the number of women they employ and what positions they hold.In November 2013 the Abe cabinet passed bill to liberalize Japan 's electricity market by abolishing price controls breaking up regional monopolies and separating power transmission from generation by creating national grid company. This move was partly in response to the 2011 Fukushima disaster and the bill faced little opposition in the Diet. By March 2015 more than 500 companies had applied to the Economy Ministry to enter the electricity retail market and the electricity industry was expected to be fully liberalized by 2016 with gas utilities expected to follow suit by 2017. Abe had also said he favored the re-building of Japan 's nuclear reactors following the Fukushima disaster though much of the authority to restart nuclear plants lies with local governments and planned to strengthen relations with the United States.In 2013 the Eurekahedge Japan Hedge Fund Index posted record 28-percent return which was credited to the unprecedented actions of the Abe government. In July 2015 the IMF reported that while the structural reforms had modestly improved growth prospects further high-impact structural reforms are needed to lift growth and prevent over-reliance on yen depreciation. 2013 Upper House election When Abe returned to office although neither party had controlled the House of Councillors the upper house of the Diet since the 2007 election the opposition DPJ was the largest party. The governing coalition enjoyed two-thirds majority in the lower house allowing it to override the upper house 's veto but this requires delay of 90 days. This situation known as the Twisted Diet had contributed to political gridlock and the revolving door of prime ministers since 2007. Abe 's campaign for the 2013 election focused on themes of economic revival asking voters to give him stable mandate in both houses to pursue reforms and took more moderate tone on defense and constitutional matters.In the 2013 upper house election the LDP emerged as the largest party with 115 seats gain of 31 and the Komeito with 20 gain of giving Abe 's coalition control of both houses of the Diet but not the two-thirds majority in the upper house that would allow for constitutional revision. With no national elections due until 2016 this result was described as giving Abe the opportunity of three golden years of parliamentary stability in which to implement his policies. Domestic policy Abe 's return to the prime ministership saw renewed attempt to downplay Japan 's wartime atrocities in school textbooks an issue that had contributed to his earlier downfall. In 2013 Abe supported the creation of the Top Global University Project program. This is ten-year program to increase international student attendance in Japanese universities and hire more foreign faculty. There is also funding for selected universities to create English-only undergraduate programs.In 2014 Abe allocated millions of dollars of the fiscal budget to help programs that help single individuals in Japan find potential mates. These programs entitled Marriage support programs were started in hopes of raising Japan 's declining birthrate which was half of what it was six decades prior. Foreign policy Shortly after taking office Abe signaled drastic reshaping of foreign policy and promised to pursue diplomacy with global rather than regional or bilateral outlook based on the fundamental values of freedom democracy basic human rights and the rule of law. His choice of Fumio Kishida as foreign minister was interpreted as sign that he would pursue more moderate line compared to his hawkish stance in the run-up to the general election. His first visit overseas after becoming prime minister once again was to various countries in Southeast Asia. Abe increased its allies in its international campaign to counter North Korean nuclear threat. Abe often visited countries such as Singapore Japan 's largest Asian investor and vice-versa.Within weeks of returning to power the Second Abe cabinet faced the In Amenas hostage crisis of 2013 in which 10 Japanese citizens were killed. Abe condemned the killings as absolutely unforgivable and confirmed that Japan and Britain had co-operated over the incident. Abe believed that this incident demonstrated the need for the creation of Japanese National Security Council see below and convened panel to consider its creation soon after the crisis.Abe was unusually active in the field of foreign affairs for Japanese prime minister making visits to 49 countries between December 2012 and September 2014 number that was described as unprecedented by contrast his immediate two predecessors Naoto Kan and Yoshihiko Noda visited combined total of 18 countries between June 2010 and December 2012. This was interpreted as means to offset poor relations with the PRC and the Koreas by increasing Japan 's profile on the world stage and improving bilateral ties with other countries in the region. Southeast Asian nations Australia and India were significant and frequent destinations for Abe who visited all 10 ASEAN countries in his first year in office. The diplomatic tours also functioned as another element of Abenomics by promoting Japan to the international business community and opening up avenues for trade energy and defense procurement deals for example business executives often travel with Abe on these visits .In September 2013 Abe intervened to aid Tokyo 's bid to host the 2020 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games giving speech in English at the IOC session in Buenos Aires in which he extolled the role of sport in Japan and sought to reassure the committee that any ongoing issues with the Fukushima plant were under control. After the bid was successful Abe sought to portray the games as symbolic of his Abenomics economic revitalization programme saying want to make the Olympics trigger for sweeping away 15 years of deflation and economic decline. In 2014 he said that he hoped robot olympics would be held at the same time to promote the robotics industry.Abe 's foreign policy moved Japan away from its traditional focus on the big three bilateral relationships with the United States PRC and South Korea and sought to increase Japan 's international profile by expanding ties with NATO the European Union and other organizations beyond the Asia-Pacific region. In 2014 Abe and British prime minister David Cameron agreed to establish framework of annual consultations between the British and Japanese foreign and defense ministries with Abe calling for greater co-operation on issues from peace of the seas to the security of the skies space and cyberspace. This followed similar agreement with French ministers in Tokyo earlier in the year.Abe concluded the Japan–Australia Economic Partnership Agreement with Australia 's Abbott government in 2014 and addressed joint sitting of the Australian Parliament in July. In heralding the agreement he also offered condolences for the suffering of Australians during World War II singling out the Kokoda Track campaign and Sandakan Death Marches. He was the first Japanese PM to address the Australian parliament.In January 2014 Abe became the first Japanese leader to attend India 's Republic Day Parade in Delhi as chief guest during three-day visit where he and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh agreed to increase co-operation over economic defense and security issues and signed trade agreements related to energy tourism and telecoms. close relationship was anticipated between Abe and Narendra Modi after the latter 's election as Prime Minister of India in May 2014 when it was noted that they had established ties from at least seven years previously when Modi was still Chief Minister of Gujarat and that Modi was one of three people Abe followed on Twitter. The two men exchanged congratulatory messages after the election. Modi made his first major foreign visit to Japan in autumn of 2014 where he and Abe discussed agreements on nuclear co-operation rare-earth elements and joint maritime exercises. During the visit Abe invited Modi to become the first Indian leader to stay at the Imperial State Guest House in Kyoto.On 30 May 2014 Abe told officials from the ASEAN countries the United States and Australia that Japan wanted to play major role in maintaining regional security departure from the passiveness it has displayed since World War II. He offered Japan 's support to other countries in resolving territorial disputes.Relations between Japan and its immediate neighbors the PRC and South Korea remained poor after Abe 's return to office. While he declared that the doors are always open on my side no bilateral meetings between Abe and the PRC leadership took place for the first 23 months of his second term. Neither did Abe hold any meetings with President Park Geun-hye of South Korea during his 2012 to 2014 term of office. Both countries criticized Abe 's visit to the Yasukuni Shrine in December 2013 with the PRC 'S Foreign Minister describing the action as moving Japan in an extremely dangerous direction. In addition the PRC continued to criticize Abe 's defense reform policies warning that Japan should not abandon its post-war policy of pacifism. Abe 's speech at the WEF in 2014 was interpreted as criticism of PRC foreign and defense policy when he said that the dividends of growth in Asia must not be wasted on military expansion and called for greater preservation of the freedom of the seas under the rule of law although he did not specifically refer to any one country during his remarks.In November 2014 Abe met PRC president Xi Jinping at the APEC meeting in Beijing for the first time since either had taken office after photocall that was described as awkward by the press. Abe later told reporters that during the meeting he suggested establishing hotline between Tokyo and Beijing to help resolve any maritime clashes and that the first step had been taken to improve relations. Defense and security policy Abe tried to centralize security policy in the Prime Minister 's office by creating the National Security Council to better coordinate national security policy and by ordering the first National Security Strategy in Japan 's history. Based upon the American body of the same name the law to create the NSC was passed in November 2013 and began operating the following month when Abe appointed Shotaro Yachi as Japan 's first National Security Advisor.In December 2013 Abe announced five-year plan of military expansion. He described this as proactive pacificism with the goal of making Japan more normal country able to defend itself. This was in reaction to PRC buildup and decreased American influence in the region.In the same month the Diet passed the Abe cabinet 's State Secrecy Law which took effect in December 2014. The law expanded the scope for the government to designate what information constitutes state secret and increased penalties for bureaucrats and journalists who leak such information to up to 10 years in prison and 10-million-yen fine. The passage of the law proved controversial with thousands protesting the bill in Tokyo and the cabinet 's approval rating falling below 50 percent for the first time in some polls. Detractors argued that the law was ambiguous and therefore gave the government too much freedom to decide which information to classify that it could curtail freedom of the press and that the cabinet had rushed the legislation without including any corresponding freedom of information guarantees. Abe argued that the law was necessary and applied only in cases of national security diplomacy public safety and counter-terrorism saying If the law prevents films from being made or weakens freedom of the press 'll resign. However he did concede that in retrospect the government should have explained the details of the bill more carefully to the public.In July 2014 the Abe cabinet decided to re-interpret Japan 's constitution to allow for the right of Collective Self-Defense. This would allow the Self Defense Forces to come to the aid of and defend an ally under attack whereas the previous interpretation of the constitution was strictly pacifist and allowed for the force to be used only in absolute self-defence. The decision was supported by the United States which has argued for greater scope for action by Japan as regional ally and led to revision of the US-Japan defense cooperation guidelines in 2015. In response the PRC Foreign Ministry said the decision raised doubts about Japan 's commitment to peace and argued that the Japanese public is opposed to the concept of collective self-defense. Abe argued that the move would not lead to Japan becoming involved in foreign wars such as the Gulf or Iraq War but instead would secure peace through deterrence. This led to the introduction of the 2015 security legislation to give legal effect to the cabinet 's decision see below. 2014 cabinet reshuffle The cabinet inaugurated in December 2012 was the longest-serving and most stable in post-war Japanese history lasting 617 days without change in personnel until Abe conducted reshuffle in September 2014 with the stated aim of promoting more women into ministerial posts. The reshuffled cabinet tied the record of five women ministers set by the first Koizumi cabinet. Most key figures such as Deputy Prime Minister Aso and Chief Cabinet Secretary Suga were kept in their posts although Abe moved Justice Minister Sadakazu Tanigaki out of the cabinet to become Secretary-General of the LDP. However on 20 October two of the women promoted in the reshuffle Justice Minister Midori Matsushima and Trade Minister Yūko Obuchi were forced to resign in separate election finance scandals. Abe told the press As prime minister bear full responsibility for having appointed them and apologize deeply to the people of Japan. 2014 general election In November 2014 while Abe was attending the APEC forum meeting in the PRC and the G20 Summit in Australia rumors began appearing in the press that he was planning to call snap election in the event that he decided to delay the second stage of the consumption tax increase. It was speculated that Abe planned to do this to reset Diet business after it had become gridlocked due to the fallout from ministerial resignations in October or because the political situation would be less favorable to re-election in 2015 and 2016.On 17 November GDP figures were released that showed Japan had fallen into recession as per the two-quarters of negative growth following the first stage of the consumption tax rise in April. Abe held press conference on 21 November and announced that he was delaying the rise in the consumption tax by 18 months from October 2015 to April 2017 and calling snap general election for 14 December. Abe described the election as the Abenomics Dissolution and asked the voters to pass judgment on his economic policies. Abe 's popularity fell slightly with the announcement and he declared that he would resign if his coalition did not win simple majority though analysts agreed this was highly unlikely due to the weak state of the opposition. The opposition parties attempted to field united front in opposition to Abe 's policies but found themselves divided on them.In the elections the LDP won 291 seats loss of but the Komeito gained to win 35. Therefore the governing coalition maintained its two-thirds majority in slightly reduced lower house of 475. Third term as prime minister 2014–2017 On 24 December 2014 Abe was re-elected to the position of Prime Minister by the House of Representatives. The only change he made when introducing his third cabinet was replacing defense minister Akinori Eto who was also involved in political funding controversy with Gen Nakatani. In his February policy speech as the Cabinet weathered Moritomo Gakuen school scandal Abe called upon the new Diet to enact most drastic reforms since the end of World War II in the sectors of the economy agriculture healthcare and others. Foreign policy On tour of the Middle East in January 2015 Abe announced that Japan would provide 200 million dollars in non-military assistance to countries fighting against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant as part of 2.5-billion-dollar aid package. Shortly after this ISIL released video in which masked figure identified as Mohammed Emwazi or Jihadi John threatened to kill two Japanese hostages Kenji Goto and Haruna Yukawa in retaliation for the move unless Abe 's government paid 200 million dollars of ransom money. Abe cut short his trip to deal with the crisis declared that such acts of terrorism were unforgivable and promised to save the hostages while refusing to pay the ransom. The Abe cabinet worked with the Jordanian government to attempt to secure the release of both hostages after further videos were released by ISIL linking their fate to that of the pilot Muath al-Kasasbeh with deputy foreign minister Yasuhide Nakayama conducting negotiations in Amman. Both hostages were killed with ISIL releasing news of Yukawa 's death on 24 January and Goto 's on 31 January. Abe condemned the killings as heinous act declared that Japan would not give in to terrorism and pledged to work with the international community to bring the killers to justice. There was some criticism of Abe for his move to pledge aid against ISIL while they were holding Japanese citizens hostage but polls showed support for his administration increasing in the aftermath of the crisis. He later used the example of the hostage crisis to argue the case for the collective self-defense legislation that his government introduced in the summer of 2015 see below .In April 2015 Abe addressed joint session of the United States Congress the first Japanese prime minister to do so. In his speech he referred to the Japan–US Alliance as the Alliance of Hope promised that Japan would play more active security and defense role in the alliance and argued that the TPP would bring both economic and security benefits to the Asia-Pacific region. The address served as part of state visit to the United States the eighth of the Obama Presidency which President Obama referred to as celebration of the ties of friendship between America and Japan. During the visit Abe attended state dinner at the White House.Like his predecessors Tomiichi Murayama and Junichiro Koizumi Abe issued statement commemorating the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II on 14 August 2015. This statement had been widely anticipated with some commentators expecting Abe to amend or even refuse to repeat the previous leaders apologies for Japan 's role in the war. In the statement Abe committed to upholding the previous apologies and expressed profound grief and eternal sincere condolences for the immeasurable damage and suffering Japan had caused for innocent people during the conflict. He also argued that Japan should not be predestined to apologize forever noting that more than eighty percent of Japanese people alive today were born after the conflict and played no part in it. The governments of both China and South Korea responded with criticism of the statement but analysts noted that it was muted and restrained in tone in comparison to the harsher rhetoric than had been employed previously. representative of the US National Security Council welcomed the statement and referred to Japan as having been model for nations everywhere in its record on peace democracy and the rule of law since the war 's end. Professor Gerald Curtis of Columbia University argued that the statement probably satisfies no constituency either in Japan or abroad but that by repeating the words aggression colonialism apology and remorse used in the Murayama Statement of 1995 it was likely to be enough to improve relations with China and Korea. In December 2015 Abe and Indian prime minister Narendra Modi signed deals in which India agreed to buy Shinkansen technology from Japan financed in part by loan from the Japanese government and for Japan to be raised to full partner status in the Malabar naval exercises. Also agreed at the talks was proposal for Japan to sell non-military nuclear technology to India to be formally signed once technical details were finalized. Demonstrating their close relationship Abe described Modi 's policies as like Shinkansen—high speed safe and reliable while carrying many people along. In return Modi complimented Abe as phenomenal leader noted how India–Japan relations had wonderful human touch and invited him to attend the Ganga aarti ceremony at Dashashwamedh Ghat in his Varanasi constituency. Analysts described the nuclear deal as part of Japan and India 's efforts to respond to the growing power of the PRC in the Asia-Pacific region.In Seoul in November 2015 Abe attended the first China–Japan–South Korea trilateral summit held for three years with Korean president Park Geun-hye and PRC premier Li Keqiang. The summits had been suspended in 2012 due to tensions over historical and territorial issues. The leaders agreed to restore the summits as annual events negotiate trilateral free trade agreement and work to check North Korea 's nuclear weapons programme. They also announced that trilateral co-operation had been completely restored .Japan 's relations with South Korea improved somewhat during Abe 's third term in the aftermath of Abe 's war anniversary statement. Abe and South Korea 's President Park Geun-hye held their first bilateral meeting in November 2015 where they agreed to resolve the comfort women dispute which Park described as the biggest obstacle to closer ties. In late December 2015 foreign ministers Fumio Kishida and Yun Byung-se announced in Seoul that deal had been reached to resolve the comfort women dispute in which Japan agreed to pay billion yen US 8.3 million into fund to support the 46 surviving victims and issued statement that contained Abe 's most sincere apologies and remorse. Abe later telephoned Park to issue the apology. In return the South Korean government agreed to consider the matter finally and irreversibly resolved and work to remove statue in front of the Japanese embassy in Seoul. Both sides agreed to refrain from criticizing each other over the issue in the future. President Park stated that the agreement would be new starting point for relations between the two countries although both leaders received some domestic criticism Abe for issuing the apology and Park for accepting the deal. On 27 May 2016 Abe accompanied Barack Obama when he became the first sitting US president to visit Hiroshima 71 years after the US atomic bombing of the city towards the end of World War II. The two paid tribute to the victims of the bombing at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum during the visit both leaders pledged to promote nuclear disarmament. Ahead of the visit Obama said it would highlight the extraordinary alliance between Japan and the United States. Shortly after Donald Trump had won the US presidential election Abe cut short his presence at an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit being held in Lima Peru in order to have an informal impromptu meeting with the then president-elect at the Trump Tower. After Trump 's inauguration they had formal meeting at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach Florida at which they discussed security in light of North Korean threat with Abe stating that Japan would be more committed to Japan–United States relations. They also golfed alongside South African professional golfer Ernie Els. Security and defense issues In his April speech to the US Congress Abe announced that his government would enact all necessary bills by this coming summer to expand the Self-Defense Forces capacity for operations and to give effect to the cabinet 's July 2014 decision to re-interpret the constitution in favor of collective self-defense. The Abe cabinet then introduced 11 bills making up the Peace and Security Preservation Legislation into the Diet in May 2015 which pushed for limited expansion of military powers to fight in foreign conflict. The principal aims of the bills were to allow Japan 's Self-Defense Forces to come to the aid of allied nations under attack even if Japan itself was not to expand their scope to support international peacekeeping operations and to allow for Japan to take on greater share of security responsibilities as part of the US-Japan Alliance.To allow for enough time to pass the bills in the face of lengthy opposition scrutiny the Abe cabinet extended the Diet session by 95 days from June into September making it the longest in the post-war era. The bills passed the House of Representatives on 16 July with the support of the majority LDP-Komeito coalition. Diet members from the opposition Democratic Innovation Communist and Social Democratic parties walked out of the vote in protest at what they said was the government 's move to force the bills through without sufficient debate and ignore responsible opposition parties. Abe countered by arguing that the bills had been debated for as many as 113 hours before the vote. While common practice in many other parliamentary democracies government using its majority to railroad controversial bills through the Diet in the face of political and public opposition is subject of criticism in Japan.As result of these moves Abe faced public backlash and opinion polls showed that his approval ratings fell into negative figures for the first time since he returned to power in 2012 with 50 percent disapproving and 38 percent approving of the cabinet according to one Nikkei survey taken at the beginning of August. Many protested outside the Diet buildings denouncing what was referred to as war bills by opponents. Organizers of the protests estimated that up to 100,000 protesters marched against the bills passage of the lower house in July. During Diet committee hearings on the bills constitutional scholars some of whom had been invited by the ruling parties and former Supreme Court justice argued that the legislation was unconstitutional. Abe was publicly criticized by atomic bomb survivor Sumiteru Taniguchi in his speech at the Nagasaki memorial ceremony on August when he stated that the defense reforms would take Japan back to the wartime period. Members of the Abe cabinet said that they would make greater effort to explain the contents of and the reasons for the security legislation to the public with the LDP releasing an animated cartoon commercial and Abe appearing live on television and internet chat streams to make the case for the legislation and take questions from members of the public. The security bills were finally approved by the House of Councillors 148 votes to 90 and became law on 19 September. This followed opposition attempts using delaying tactics as well as physical altercations in which some Diet members attempted to stop the relevant chairman from calling the vote to move the bill out of committee and to general vote. After the vote Abe issued statement saying that the new laws will fortify our pledge to never again wage war and that the legislation rather than being war bills was instead aimed at deterring war and contributing to peace and security. He also pledged to continue to explain the legislation to try to gain greater understanding from the public on the issue. Following the bills passage Abe was expected to once again return his focus to economic issues.On 18 October 2015 Abe presided over the triennial fleet review of the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force JMSDF in his role as Commander-in-Chief of the Self-Defense Forces. In his speech to personnel on board the destroyer Kurama he announced that by highly hoisting the flag of 'proactive pacifism 'm determined to contribute more than ever to world peace and prosperity. Later that day he went aboard the USS Ronald Reagan becoming the first Japanese prime minister to set foot on an American warship.In December 2015 the Abe government announced the creation of new intelligence unit the International Counterterrorism Intelligence Collection Unit to aid counter-terrorism operations to be based in the Foreign Ministry but led by the Prime Minister 's Office. This was reported as being part of efforts to step up security measures in preparation for the 2016 G7 Summit in Shima Mie and 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. In the same month the cabinet approved Japan 's largest-ever defense budget at 5.1 trillion yen US 45 billion for the fiscal year beginning in April 2016. The package included funding intended for the purchase of three Global Hawk drones six F-35 fighter jets and Boeing KC-46A midair refueling aircraft. Re-election as LDP president and Abenomics 2.0 In September 2015 Abe was re-elected as president of the LDP in an uncontested election after LDP Diet member Seiko Noda failed to garner enough support to stand as candidate. Following this Abe carried out cabinet reshuffle once again keeping the key ministers of Finance Economy Foreign Affairs and the Chief Cabinet Secretary in post. He also created new ministerial position for the coordination of policies related to the economy population decline and social security reform which was filled by Katsunobu Katō.At press conference after his official re-election as LDP president Abe announced that the next stage of his administration would focus on what he called Abenomics 2.0 the aim of which was to tackle issues of low fertility and an aging population and create society in which each and every one of Japan 's 100 million citizens can take on active roles. This new policy consisted of targets which Abe referred to as three new arrows to boost Japan 's GDP to 600 trillion yen by 2021 to raise the national fertility rate from an average of 1.4 to 1.8 children per woman and stabilize the population at 100 million and to create situation where people would not have to leave employment to care for elderly relatives by the mid-2020s. Abe explained that the government would take measures to increase wages boost consumption and expand childcare social security and care services for the elderly to meet these goals.This new iteration of Abenomics was met with some criticism by commentators who argued that it was not yet clear if the first three arrows had succeeded in lifting Japan out of deflation inflation was some way below the percent target that the new arrows were merely presented as targets without the necessary policies to meet them and that the targets themselves were unrealistic. However opinion polls during the final months of 2015 showed the Abe cabinet 's approval ratings once again climbing into positive figures after the change in emphasis back to economic issues.At the conclusion of the Trans-Pacific Partnership talks in early October 2015 Abe hailed the agreement for creating an unprecedented economic zone and opening up possibilities for an even wider Asia-Pacific free trade deal and Japanese trade with Europe. He also promised to mitigate any negative effects on the Japanese agricultural sector. GDP figures released in November 2015 initially appeared to show that Japan had entered second recession since the implementation of Abenomics. However these figures were subsequently revised to show that the economy had grown by percent in the third quarter thus avoiding recession.In December 2015 the two parties making up Abe 's governing coalition agreed to introduce reduced rate of consumption tax for food when the anticipated tax increase from to 10 percent takes place in April 2017. This deal was reached after Abe was seen to come down strongly in favor of the position held by his junior coalition partner the Komeito that the tax rate should be reduced which prompted some disagreement from members of his party who favored policy of greater fiscal consolidation through taxes. Abe dismissed the chairman of the LDP 's tax panel Takeshi Noda who opposed the reduction and appointed Yoichi Miyazawa who was more favorable to the policy as his replacement. Abe declared the tax deal to be the best possible result of the negotiations. Constitutional revision At the 2016 election to the House of Councillors the first that allowed Japanese citizens 18 and over to vote Abe led the LDP–Komeito pact to victory with the coalition being the largest in the House of Councillors since it was set at 242 seats. The election 's results opened the debate on constitutional reform particularly in amending Article of Japan 's pacifist constitution with pro-revisionist parties gaining the two-thirds majority being necessary for reform alongside two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives which would ultimately lead to nationwide referendum. Abe remained relatively quiet on the issue for the remainder of the year but in May 2017 announced that the constitutional reform would be in effect by 2020. Fourth term as prime minister 2017–2020 The 2017 general election was held on 22 October. Prime Minister Abe called the snap election on 25 September while the North Korea crisis was prominent in the news media. Political opponents of Abe say the snap election was designed to evade questioning in parliament over alleged scandals. Abe was expected to retain majority of seats in the Diet. Abe 's ruling coalition took almost majority of the vote and two-thirds of the seats. The last-minute campaigning and voting took place as Typhoon Lan the biggest typhoon of 2017 was wreaking havoc on Japan. On 20 September 2018 Abe was re-elected as leader of the main ruling Liberal Democratic Party. On 19 November 2019 Abe became Japan 's longest-serving prime minister surpassing the 2,883-day record of Katsura Tarō. On 24 August 2020 Abe became the longest-serving prime minister in terms of consecutive days in office surpassing Eisaku Satō 's 2,798-day record. Favoritism scandals In March 2018 it was revealed that the finance ministry with finance minister Tarō Asō at its head had falsified documents presented to the parliament in relation to the Moritomo Gakuen scandal in order to remove 14 passages implicating Abe. It was suggested that the scandal could cost Abe his seat as Liberal Democratic party 's leader. Further accusations arose the same year that Abe had given preferential treatment to his friend Kotarō Kake to open veterinary department at his school Kake Gakuen. Abe denied the charges but support for his administration fell below 30 in the polls the lowest since his taking power in 2012. Those who called for him to step down included former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi. The scandal was referred to by some as Abegate. Former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi speculated that Abe would likely resign due to the scandal.The scandals while not damaging his political standing permanently did little good for his image. In July 2018 Abe 's public standing was further hit after he held drinking party with LDP lawmakers during the peak of the floods in western Japan. In 2020 Abe came under further criticism for extending the term of top Tokyo prosecutor Hiromu Kurokawa who later resigned amid gambling scandal. Abe 's approval rating fell from 40 to 27 during the month of May 2020 largely due to his handling of the Kurokawa situation. Foreign policy Abe supported the 2018 North Korea–United States summit. Shortly after the summit was announced Abe told reporters he appreciated North Korea 's change and attributed the diplomatic change in tone to the coordinated sanctions campaign by the United States Japan and South Korea. Abe however cautioned President Trump not to compromise on North Korea 's missile program and leave Japan exposed to short-range missiles or relieve pressure on North Korea too soon before complete denuclearization. Abe also expressed desire to hold bilateral meeting with North Korea on the issue of abductions of Japanese citizens pressing President Trump to raise the matter at the summit. Reports in 2019 revealed that Abe authorized covering up information about two missing people from Japan living in North Korea.In 2018 Abe paid 2-day formal visit to the PRC in the hopes of improving foreign relations where he had several meetings with President Xi Jinping. At this time Abe promised that in 2019 he would ease restrictions on the eligibility for PRC citizens to obtain Japanese visas especially among teenagers. Abe also stated that he hoped Xi Jinping would visit Japan to cultivate better relations between the two countries. Abe cautioned Xi Jinping over protests in Hong Kong at the G20 Summit. Abe told Xi it is important for free and open Hong Kong to prosper under the 'one country two systems policy .Regarding the territorial dispute with Russia Abe adopted the two plus alpha approach altering the previous governments position that Habomai Shikotan Etorofu and Kunashiri islands be returned to Japan 's sovereign. In 2021 interview Abe spoke about his negotiation with the Russian president Vladimir Putin in 2018 also confirming he had requested Fumio Kishida to continue with this approach to avoid worsening Japan 's relations with Russia.Writing of what he characterizes as the most serious failure of the Abe administration co-director of the Institute of Contemporary Japanese Studies of Temple University in Japan Robert Dujarric wrote The election of Donald Trump raised existential questions about the reliability of Washington as guarantor of Tokyo 's security. The events of January 6th… reflected the fact that substantial number of Republican voters believe that Trump had won the election and appeared to endorse his supporters use of lethal violence to keep him in the White House which was indeed very worrisome for the Japanese. Yet neither Abe 's Japan nor for that matter any country that relies on the US as the ultimate guarantor of its security—South Korea Taiwan or all of NATO—took any significant steps to buttress their military to prepare for the day when the Americans might not be able to come to their rescue. That is also true for their diplomacy economic policies and other components of national security. For this however it is hard to blame Abe alone. Japanese voters would have had no interest in such course of action which would have entailed major costs. Economic policy In July 2018 Japan became the second country after Mexico to ratify the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership CPTPP. CPTPP evolved from the Trans-Pacific Partnership which never came into force after then US president Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the agreement in early 2017. Abe 's administration was credited with overcoming protectionist pressures within Japan and rallying the 10 other TPP member countries to support CPTPP which largely kept the previous agreement intact and left the door open to an eventual US return. Whaling In 2019 Japan resumed commercial whaling for the first time in 31 years day after withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission IWC. The district Abe hailed from and represented includes major whaling center and he long pushed to resume commercial whaling. Retirement Abe 's colitis relapsed in June 2020 and resulted in his health deteriorating through the summer. Following several hospital visits Abe announced on 28 August 2020 that he intended to retire as prime minister citing his inability to carry out the duties of the office while seeking treatment for his condition. During the press conference announcing his retirement Abe indicated that he would remain in office until successor was chosen by the LDP but declined to endorse any specific successor. Abe expressed regret at being unable to fully accomplish his policy goals due to his early retirement. Yoshihide Suga was elected as his successor by the LDP on 14 September 2020 and took office as prime minister on 16 September. Assassination On July 2022 around 11:30 JST Abe was shot while delivering campaign speech at Yamato-Saidaiji Station Nara. He was supporting fellow LDP party member Kei Satō for the House of Councillors election.The assassin approached Abe from behind and fired two shots using homemade firearm. The first shot missed and prompted Abe to turn around at which point second shot was fired hitting Abe in the neck and chest area. He was fatally struck in the heart.Abe was rushed to the Nara Medical University Hospital in Kashihara by helicopter. Prior to his arrival at the hospital Abe had already shown no vital signs. Despite transfusion of 100 units of blood approx. 56 litres the blood loss was too great and attempts to resuscitate Abe failed he was pronounced dead at 17:03 JST. He was 67 years old.A 41-year-old man named Tetsuya Yamagami former JMSDF member who served for three years from 2002 to 2005 was immediately arrested and later confessed to local police. Yamagami stated that he held grudge against the Unification Church and shot Abe because the religious group and Abe were connected. Yamagami said he resented the fact that his mother was brain-washed by the religious group and went bankrupt. Yamagami had been trying to kill Hak Ja Han of the Unification Church since around 2002 when his mother went bankrupt but he gave up because he could not get close to her and changed his target to Abe. He also stated that he killed Abe because he believed the former prime minister had spread the religion to Japan. Abe and his family were known to have long-standing ties to the Unification Church dating back to his grandfather Kishi Nobusuke Abe himself had held speeches in support of the religious movement. According to research by Nikkan Gendai 10 out of 20 members in the Fourth Abe Cabinet had connections to the Unification Church. Yamagami said that he did n't have grudge against Abe 's political beliefs. In response to the shooting and his subsequent death numerous present and former world leaders expressed their sympathies and support for Abe. His body was returned to Tokyo the day after his assassination and his funeral took place on 27 September 2022. Controversies and issues Historic negationism Throughout his political life Abe often engaged in historical negationism especially in regards to Japanese war crimes during World War II. According to some analysts this caused Japan 's relations with South Korea and China to deteriorate under his premiership. In the PRC how Abe is thought of in retrospect is mixed while he was often criticized as an extreme nationalist others also recognized his efforts for reconciliation between their two countries.Since 1997 as the bureau chief of the Institute of Junior Assembly Members Who Think About the Outlook of Japan and History Education Abe led the Society for History Textbook Reform. Abe was affiliated with the ultra-conservative revisionist organization Nippon Kaigi Japan Conference .According to Alexis Dudden professor of history at the University of Connecticut who specializes in modern Japan and Korea in the 1990s when Abe first became parliamentarian he is believed to have co-authored document denying the Nanjing Massacre the article used to be available in Japan 's Diet archives but has since disappeared. Abe also made comments that denied the occurrence of the massacre. Dudden has said Nanjing Massacre denial is akin to Holocaust denial.In 2007 Abe denied to reporters that Japan forced women into sexual slavery during World War II. On his official homepage he questioned the extent to which coercion was applied toward the comfort women dismissing South Korean positions on the issue as foreign interference in Japanese domestic affairs. In Diet session on October 2006 Abe revised his statement regarding comfort women and said that he accepted the report issued in 1993 by the sitting cabinet secretary Yōhei Kōno wherein the Japanese government officially acknowledged the issue. Later in the session Abe stated his belief that Class-A war criminals are not criminals under Japan 's domestic law.In meeting of the Lower House Budget Committee in February 2006 Shinzo Abe said There is problem as to how to define aggressive wars we can not say it is decided academically and It is not the business of the government to decide how to define the last world war. think we have to wait for the estimation of historians .On television program in July 2006 he denied that Manchukuo was puppet state of Japan. Manchukuo was notorious for its exploitative rule and use of slave labor when it was under the economic management of Nobusuke Kishi Abe 's grandfather.Abe published book called Toward Beautiful Nation 美しい国へ Utsukushii kuni in July 2006 which became bestseller in Japan. The South Korean and PRC governments as well as noted academics and commentators voiced concern about Abe 's historical views.In March 2007 in response to United States Congress resolution introduced by Mike Honda Abe denied any government coercion in the recruitment of comfort women during World War II. This was in line with statement made almost ten years earlier in which Abe voiced his opposition to the inclusion of the subject of military prostitution in several school textbooks while denying any coercion in the narrow sense of the word environmental factors notwithstanding. This statement provoked negative reactions in Asian and western countries New York Times editorial on March 2007 commented for instance What part of 'Japanese Army sex slaves does Japan 's prime minister Shinzo Abe have so much trouble understanding and apologizing for These were not commercial brothels. Force explicit and implicit was used in recruiting these women. What went on in them was serial rape not prostitution. The Japanese Army 's involvement is documented in the government 's own defense files. senior Tokyo official more or less apologized for this horrific crime in 1993… Yesterday Abe grudgingly acknowledged the 1993 quasi-apology but only as part of pre-emptive declaration that his government would reject the call now pending in the United States Congress for an official apology. America is n't the only country interested in seeing Japan belatedly accept full responsibility. South Korea and China are also infuriated by years of Japanese equivocations over the issue. 2007 Washington Post editorial Shinzo Abe 's Double Talk also criticized him he 's passionate about Japanese victims of North Korea—and blind to Japan 's own war crimes. In The New York Times in 2014 an editorial called Abe nationalist who was profound threat to American–Japanese relations and an opinion piece labeled Abe 's position on the subject of comfort women war on truth. The same editorial presented him as revisionist view largely accepted by the international and part of the Japanese press. Writing in the London Review of Books political scientist Edward Luttwak called Abe pragmatic Japanese Tory driving through reforms at home while weaving an alliance aimed at containing China. In 2015 Abe publicly recognized that the Japanese government had trapped the comfort women in sexual slavery apologized and developed reparations fund with South Korean president Park Geun-hye. In 2018 while negotiating comfort women deal with then South Korean president Moon Jae-in Abe demanded that South Korea remove statues of comfort women that had been installed in South Korea the United States Australia and Germany. In late 2018 the Supreme Court of Korea and other high courts ordered several Japanese companies including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Nachi-Fujikoshi and Nippon Steel to make compensations to the families of Koreans who were unfairly treated and illegally forced to supply labor for World War II war efforts. The Japanese government protested these decisions Abe argued that any issues concerning Japan 's rule of Korea were previously resolved in the Treaty on Basic Relations Between Japan and the Republic of Korea which normalized relations between Japan and South Korea adding that further requests of reparations meant that South Korea had violated the treaty. In August 2019 Abe 's cabinet approved the removal of South Korea from Japan 's trade whitelist the subsequent trade dispute between South Korea and Japan is still ongoing and has caused significant deterioration in Japan–South Korea relations. Response to mass media The Asahi Shimbun accused Abe and Shōichi Nakagawa of censoring 2001 NHK program concerning The Women 's International War Crimes Tribunal. The tribunal was private committee to adjudicate comfort women about 5,000 people including 64 victims from Japan and abroad attended. The committee members who claimed to be specialists in international law claimed that Emperor Hirohito and the Japanese government were responsible for the use of comfort women. The TV program however did not mention the full name of the tribunal and keywords such as Japanese troops or sexual slavery and it also cut the sight of the tribunal the host grouping statements of the organizer and the judgment itself. Instead it presented criticism against the tribunal by right-wing academic and his statement that there was no abduction of sex slaves and they were prostitutes .On the day following the Asahi Shimbun report Akira Nagai the chief producer and primary person responsible for the program held press conference and ensured the report of the Asahi Shimbun. Abe stated that the content had to be broadcast from neutral point of view and what did is not to give political pressure. Abe said It was political terrorism by Asahi Shimbun and it was tremendously clear that they had the intention to inhume me and Mr. Nakagawa politically and it is also clear that it was complete fabrication. He also characterized the tribunal as mock trial and raised objection to the presence of North Korean prosecutors singling them out as agents of the North Korean government. Abe 's actions in the NHK incident were criticized by journalists as being both illegal for violating the Broadcasting Act and unconstitutional for violating the constitution.On 24 October 2006 report emerged that Abe 's new administration had called on the NHK to pay attention to the North Korean abductees issue. Critics some even within Abe 's own LDP party charged that the government was violating freedom of expression by meddling in the affairs of the public broadcaster.In December 2006 it was revealed that former prime minister Junichiro Koizumi 's government in which Abe was Chief Cabinet Secretary had influenced town hall-style meetings during which paid performers would ask government officials favorable questions.On 22 November 2012 it was reported that TBS 's early morning TV show Asazuba accidentally displayed Abe 's photo alongside news report about an NHK announcer 's arrest for sex offense. Abe 's face filled viewers screens along with the name of NHK announcer Takeshige Morimoto who anchors NHK 's Ohayo Nippon program on Saturday and Sunday. Morimoto was arrested for allegedly groping woman on the train. Abe posted on his public Facebook page This morning on the TBS show Asazuba when newscaster reported on story regarding the apprehension of molester photo of me was shown. Images of this blunder can now be seen clearly across the Internet Have the slander campaigns already begun. If this were merely an accident it would be proper for the TV station to give me personal apology but as yet have n't heard single word. The newscaster acknowledged that the incorrect image had been displayed but merely stated that the photo was unrelated and did not refer to the politician by name. Neither Abe nor his office received any form of apology.Abe 's constant interference and intimidation of media outlets was cited as one of many reasons Japan fell to 72nd place on the Press Freedom Index in 2016 in contrast to its previous 11th place ranking from six years prior. Yasukuni Shrine Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine on several occasions which enshrines the spirits of Japan 's war dead including several Class-A war criminals convicted in the International Military Tribunal for the Far East. While serving as Chief Cabinet Secretary in the government of Junichiro Koizumi he visited in April 2006 prompting South Korea to describe the trip as regrettable. He visited again on 15 August 2012 the anniversary of the end of World War II. After winning the presidency of the Liberal Democratic Party he visited on 17 October 2012 in an official capacity as party president.He initially refrained from visiting the shrine as sitting prime minister. He did not visit at all during his first term from September 2006 to September 2007 unlike his predecessor Koizumi who had visited yearly while in office. Abe 's not visiting the shrine prompted Japanese nationalist named Yoshihiro Tanjo to cut off his little finger in protest and mail it to the LDP. While campaigning for the presidency of the LDP in 2012 Abe said that he regretted not visiting the shrine while prime minister. He again refrained from visiting the shrine during the first year of his second stint as prime minister in consideration of improving relations with the PRC and Korea whose leaders refused to meet with Abe during this time. He said on December 2013 that it is natural that we should express our feelings of respect to the war dead who sacrificed their lives for the nation ... but it is my thinking that we should avoid making Yasukuni visits political and diplomatic issues. In lieu of visiting Abe sent ritual offerings to the shrine for festivals in April and October 2013 as well as the anniversary of the end of World War II in August 2013.His first visit to the shrine as prime minister took place on 26 December 2013 the first anniversary of his second term in office. It was the first visit to the shrine by sitting prime minister since Junichiro Koizumi visited in August 2006. Abe said that he prayed to pay respect for the war dead who sacrificed their precious lives and hoped that they rest in peace. The PRC government published protest that day calling government visits to the shrine an effort to glorify the Japanese militaristic history of external invasion and colonial rule and to challenge the outcome of World War II. Qin Gang of the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Abe is unwelcome by Chinese people ... Chinese leaders wo n't meet him any more. The Mainichi Shimbun argued in an editorial that the visit could also cast dark shadow on relations with the United States. The US embassy in Tokyo released statement saying that the United States is disappointed that Japan 's leadership has taken an action that will exacerbate tensions with Japan 's neighbors. The Wall Street Journal reported that US officials urged Abe not to visit the shrine and pay homage to war criminals anymore. On 15 August 2014 the 69th anniversary of the surrender of Japan in World War II Abe chose to not visit the shrine in what was perceived as diplomatic gesture to the PRC South Korea and Taiwan. Despite Abe 's absence the PRC and South Korea both voiced their disapproval at Japan 's leadership as large number of politicians including three cabinet members did attend the shrine to mark the anniversary. Photographs with 731 In May 2013 Abe posed for photographs giving thumbs up gestures while sitting in the cockpit of Kawasaki T-4 military training aircraft of the Japan Air Self-Defense Force 's Blue Impulse aerobatics team. The aircraft was numbered 731 which was the number of the infamous Imperial Japanese Army Unit 731 that conducted lethal chemical and biological experiments on live prisoners of war during World War II. South Korean politician Chung Mong-joon described Abe 's actions as an act of direct provocation to Korea China and other victim nations. In response Japanese Defense Ministry official said that the numbering on the jet was coincidental and that the numbers were the pilot 's individual ID number. Restoration of Sovereignty Day On 28 April 2013 new public event the Restoration of Sovereignty Day was held in Tokyo to mark the 61st anniversary of the end of the US occupation of Japan. It had been proposed by Abe in 2012. Since the US occupation of Okinawa ended in 1972 and nearly three-quarters of US troops in Japan continue to be stationed in Okinawa the event which was attended by Emperor Akihito was denounced by many Okinawans who saw it as celebrating betrayal. There were demonstrations in both Okinawa and Tokyo. Migratory policies In 2015 the Abe government refused to admit refugees affected by conflicts in the Middle East and Africa. Abe said Japan must solve its own problems before accepting immigrants. Abe backed short-term work visa deal for migrant workers to work for limited period earn more and return home. Claims by journalists By the time Shinzo Abe was shot many allegations about the Unification Association had already been made by Japanese journalists. Takashi Uesugi claims that if you do n't know about Abe 's relationship with the Unification Church you are disqualified as journalist. Personal life Abe married Akie Matsuzaki socialite and former radio disc jockey in 1987. She is the daughter of the president of Morinaga confectionery manufacturer. She is popularly known as the domestic opposition party due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband 's. Following her husband 's first stint as prime minister she opened an organic izakaya in the Kanda district of Tokyo but remained inactive in management due to the urging of her mother-in-law. The couple were unable to have children having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe 's elder brother Hironobu Abe became president and CEO of Mitsubishi Shōji Packaging Corporation while his younger brother Nobuo Kishi became Senior Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs. In addition to his native Japanese Abe spoke English. Legacy Abe was often referred to as the shadow shogun due to his profound influence on Japanese politics during his life. After his assassination Japanologist Michael Green described Abe as the most consequential modern Japanese leader and argued that Japan 's future appears to be that of Abe 's vision. Following Abe 's assassination the LDP–Komeito coalition won majority of the available seats in the upper house in the 10 July election. This gave the government majority in the upper house. Many such as Sheila A. Smith of the Council on Foreign Relations and East Asia expert Jeff Kingston speculated that revised constitution especially revision of its article clause which outlaws war and the maintenance of military forces may become Abe 's main legacy.A Washington Post analysis described Abe as the preeminent statesman of the Indo-Pacific whose realist approach helped build cooperative security network in East Asia. Columnist Josh Rogin wrote that Abe 's lasting legacy was world better prepared to confront an increasingly assertive China. Similarly US Admiral James Stavridis wrote that Abe 's greatest contribution was strengthened Japanese military. His death solicited tributes and condolences from many states and leaders testament to his commitment to international relations. Consultant Bill Emmott noted that thanks to Abe 's diplomacy he was more popular abroad than domestically bearing similarities to Margaret Thatcher. Economist Matthew P. Goodman of the Center for Strategic and International Studies CSIS wrote that Abe 's legacy was that of Champion of the Global Economic Order whose administration launched the Partnership for Quality Infrastructure infrastructure project in Asia proposed an internationally endorsed organizing principle for global data governance kickstarted the TPP and later salvaged it with the CPTPP. Indian commentator Harshil Mehta called Abe Unifier of Oceans in his obituary due to formation of the Quad and wrote that he stayed committed to the common cause of Japan and India.Conversely Abe 's nationalism and historical denialism strained long-term relations with the neighboring PRC and South Korea. Abe 's complex legacy was displayed in both nations following his assassination where some praised Abe 's efforts to improve relations and others denounced his views on Japanese history with its neighbors. In addition journalist Jake Adelstein argued that Abe left legacy vexed by authoritarianism with his actions throughout his tenure such as the intimidation of media that were critical of him leading to Japan 's fall on the Press Freedom Index to as low as 72nd stoking anti-Korean sentiments as well as the creation of Cabinet Personnel Bureau to vet bureaucratic positions of anyone that may be openly critical of the government among others.In Japan Abe remains controversial and is described as the most polarizing figure in contemporary Japanese politics. Domestic divisiveness created by his historical negationist efforts is long-lasting. Abe also had profound and lasting effect on the Japanese economy through Abenomics leaving behind mixed economic record.

Due to the depth of sea oil tankers and big ships have to pass between Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs this makes these islands some of the most strategic points in the Persian Gulf.

Due to the depth of sea oil tankers and big ships have to pass between Abu Musa and Greater and Lesser Tunbs this makes these islands some of the most strategic points in the Persian Gulf. The island is administered by Iran as part of its province of Hormozgan but is also claimed by the United Arab Emirates as territory of the emirate of Sharjah. Name Iranian Abu Musa 's inhabitants call it Gap-sabzu Persian گپ‌سبزو which in Persian means the great green place. On old Persian maps the island is called Boum-Ouw Persian بوم‌اوو or Boum-Ouf Persian بوم‌اوف which in Persian means Waterland. Boum-Souz Persian بوم‌سوز or Boum-Sou Boum-Souw Persian بوم‌سو or Gap-Sabzou Persian گپ‌سبزو which in Persian means Green Land .However in recent centuries it has also been called Bum Musa Persian for the land of Musa/Moses instead of Boum-Sou .In Arabic sources Abu Musa Arabic أبو موسى comes from Abu Musa al-Ash'ari companion of Prophet Muhammad who stayed on the island in 643 A.D before battling the Persians. Geography Abu Musa island is located 70 kilometres 43 mi south of Bandar-e Shenas and 59 kilometres 37 mi north-northwest of Sharjah. Out of 14 islands of Hormozgan it is the island farthest from the Iranian coast. Its highest point is the 110-metre 360 ft Mount Halva. Abu Musa city is the center of the island. The weather in Abu Musa is warm and humid although compared to the place in the Persian Gulf Abu Musa has better climate and the most diverse ecosystem but it lacks suitable soil and water for farming leaving fishing as the main industry for locals. It is served by the regional Abu Musa Airport. History The sovereignty of Iran on Abu Musa has been disputed by UAE which inherited the dispute in 1971. By common consent the island had been under the control of the Al-Qasimi ruler of Sharjah. In 1906 Salim bin Sultan the uncle of Sharjah 's ruler Saqr bin Khalid awarded concession for the iron oxide deposits of Abu Musa to three Arabs whose workers extracted the mineral and agreed to sell it to Wonckhaus German enterprise. However when Saqr bin Khalid discovered this he cancelled the concession and the workers were removed from the island with assistance from the British resulting in an international incident.After 1908 the UK controlled the island along with the other British-held islands in the Persian Gulf including what is today the UAE. In the late 1960s the UK transferred administration of the island to the British-appointed Sharjah one of the seven sheikdoms that would later form the UAE. After the UK announced in 1968 that it would end its administrative and military positions in the Persian Gulf Iran moved to reattach the island politically to the mainland. On 30 November 1971 two days before the official establishment of UAE Iran and Sharjah signed Memorandum of Understanding. They agreed to allow Sharjah to have local police station and Iran to station troops on the island according to the map attached to the Memorandum of Understanding. The agreement also divided the island 's energy resources between the two signatories. By agreeing to the pact the tiny emirate prevented an invasion by Iran which two days earlier had taken two other disputed islands the Greater and Lesser Tunbs which were even smaller and uninhabited. Iranian takeover On 30 November 1971 day before the UK officially left the region Iran moved troops onto the island and was officially welcomed by the Sheik of Sharjah 's brother Sheik Saqer. UAE claim The UAE took its sovereignty claim over Abu Musa and the two Tunb islands to meeting of the United Nations Security Council of December 1971. At that meeting it was decided to defer consideration of this matter to later date. Iraq Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr era Kuwait Algeria South Yemen and Libya held the view that the territory rightfully belongs to the UAE. Since that time the UAE has consistently called in public statements for either bilateral negotiations or by referring the issue to the International Court of Justice or another form of international arbitration .Saddam Hussein attempted to justify the Iran–Iraq War by claiming that one of the objectives was to liberate Abu Musa and the Tunbs in the Persian Gulf. In 1992 Iran expelled foreign workers who operated the UAE-sponsored school medical clinic and power-generating station. The dispute has also caused serious friction between Ras al-Khaimah and Sharjah on the one hand and some other emirates of the UAE on the other. Ras Al Khaimah advocates tough measures against Iran. Dubai on the other hand believes that the conflict is unnecessary. The present ruler of Dubai who is also Vice President Prime Minister and Defence Minister of the UAE Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum has earlier stated publicly that he believes the tensions over the islands have been fabricated by the United States .In 2012 visit to the island by Iranian president Ahmedinejad provoked diplomatic incident. Iran 's historical claim to ownership over the islands roots back to the Parthian and Sasanian Empires among others. Iran considers the island to have been occupied by the UK and refers to the agreement between Iran and the emirate of Sharjah in 1971. Demographics As of 2012 the island had about 2,131 inhabitants making it Iran 's smallest county. The city of Abu Musa had 1,953 inhabitants in 2012 up 248 from 2006.Most of the residents of the island speak the Bandari dialect of Persian. Native UAE citizens living on the island allegedly face great difficulties with the lack of proper clinics and schools. Only one school exists on the island and it is used by 150 students. Moreover patients have to be transported to Sharjah to receive treatment but that is sometimes not feasible because of the Iranian authorities. In addition Iran allegedly delays or blocks UAE 's school and medical supplies from entering the island.

Academic Freedom and Apartheid,Academic Freedom and Apartheid The Story of the World Archaeological Congress London Duckworth 1987 by Peter Ucko is personal account of the 1986 World Archaeological Congress WAC originally intended to be the eleventh congress of the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences IUPPS. Ucko who organised the Congress presents step-by-step narrative of how the Congress came to ban participation by South Africans and Namibians as part of the Academic boycott of South Africa and how this led to it splitting from the IUPPS. It quotes extensively from sources such as correspondence minutes newspapers WAC publicity and others accounts of the WAC.,Academic Freedom and Apartheid The Story of the World Archaeological Congress London Duckworth 1987 by Peter Ucko is personal account of the 1986 World Archaeological Congress WAC originally intended to be the eleventh congress of the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences IUPPS. Ucko who organised the Congress presents step-by-step narrative of how the Congress came to ban participation by South Africans and Namibians as part of the Academic boycott of South Africa and how this led to it splitting from the IUPPS. It quotes extensively from sources such as correspondence minutes newspapers WAC publicity and others accounts of the WAC. Summary After foreword by Neal Ascherson the introduction provides some autobiographical information about Ucko and sketches his personal view of the place of the WAC in the field of archaeology. One of Ucko 's key arguments is that the IUPPS and archaeology generally was too Eurocentric and exclusionary of Third- and Fourth-World viewpoints and participation. Chapter How Not to Finance Congress describes how British archaeologists upset by the poor running of the 1981 IUPPS congress determined to bring the 1986 congress to Britain and convinced Ucko newly appointed as head of archaeology at Southampton University to organise it as its National Secretary. The chapter argues that much fundraising was shambolic but narrates that Ucko succeeded in prompting relevant parties to offer sufficient underwriting for the event. Chapter Academic Planning sketches Ucko 's view that the WAC and archaeology more generally needed to be more global both in intellectual outlook and in participation. It offers detailed chronological account of assembling the academic advisers and other staffing and publishing the Congresses first and second announcements. Chapter The Banning of South African and Namibian Participation recounts growing tensions through 1985 between Ucko and key personnel of the IUPPS and political pressures brought to bear by the anti-apartheid movement particularly in Southampton to make the WAC participate in the academic boycott of South Africa and Namibia. It offers detailed accounts of various WAC organising meetings growing press interest and rapidly shifting willingness of different academics to participate in the Congress in view of the boycott. Chapter The Build-up to Paris sets the scene for the decision of meeting of the IUPPS International Executive Committee on 17 January 1986 which determined to expel the WAC from the IUPPS and to establish an alternative IUPPS congress in Mainz in 1987. It offers chronological account of shifting allegiances and Ucko 's efforts to enable extensive Third- and Fourth-World representation in Paris. Chapter Western European Manipulation and Presidential Timidity is Ucko 's blow-by-blow account of the Paris meeting and focal point for Ucko 's critique of the IUPPS 's Eurocentrism. Chapter Cancel and/or Be Damned charts events from the Paris meeting to meeting of the WAC 's Executive Committee on February 1986 at which most of the Executive resigned enabling Ucko to form new committee to continue organising the WAC outside the IUPPS. Chapter Public and World Reaction does survey some of the responses to the WAC proceeding in national press and specialist international discussions but also narrates the efforts to retain or gain funding and to enable the WAC to happen. Chapter The World Archaeological Congress largely comprises long quotations of accounts of the Congress of 1–6 September 1986 by people other than Ucko with Ucko 's own narrative of the administration of that week interspersed. Chapter The Plenary Session again largely comprises quotations of speeches made at the end-of-congress plenary at which participants from different regions express their enthusiasm for continued WACs. Chapter 10 The Aftermath comprises Ucko 's musings on events as they continued to unfold following the 1986 WAC endingAcademics who value the principle of academic free speech as and my colleagues involved in the WAC unquestionably do will have to face the inevitable dilemma again and again until apartheid in South Africa no longer exists. It is my hope that the story of the World Archaeological Congress may help them to resolve this dilemma to come out from behind the shaky edifice of their own academic freedom and turn their attention to the issue of freedom itself.Between pages 146 and 147 are eight pages of black-and-white photographs mostly from the Congress. The book concludes with eleven appendices abbreviations glossary chronology reprint of the Revised World Archaeological Congress Second Announcement chart of the organisational structure of international academic bodies mentioned in the text list of the International Executive Committee of the IUPPS list of the members of the WAC 's Executive Committee and Board of Directors list of the countries represented at the WAC copy of February 1987 letter from Ucko to the UNESCO Non-Governmental Organisations Unit seeking to establish UNESCO 's role in determining IUPPS policy on South Africa message from Anti-Apartheid and suggested revisions by the WAC Steering Committee of the IUPPS statutes. The is short list of further reading and indices. Reception The book was widely reviewed. Criticisms of the book per se included Sandra Bowdler 's argument that the book 's scope was poorly represented by its title Anybody acquiring book entitled Academic Freedom and Apartheid would understandably look forward to discussion of such topics as whether academic freedom were truly possible under the South African regime of apartheid how the more liberal South African universities and other research and educational institutions were faring in the face of their repressive government whether academics by such actions as international boycotts of various sorts had any effects on that regime and if so whether they were of the sort intended and so on. Well you can forget all that. To me the major disappointment of this book is its complete failure to enter into any detailed discussion of these topics. This is not necessarily criticism in that this is not the book 's stated aim but arises from its title. Were its title and subtitle to be interchanged the prospective reader would have much better idea of what she or he were in for. Other criticisms included alleged misleadingly selective quotation and omission of details that shed less favourable light on Ucko 's position e.g. Polish archaeologists refusing to attend in solidarity with South Africans being forced to by their government and sending token representative in response lack of recognition of the experience of Nazi occupation in forming the views of Continental European actors on academic freedom and scepticism at Ucko 's claims that he had not planned on using the WAC as platform for anti-apartheid views all along.Like the book itself reviews were often political statements focusing on stating the reviewer 's own position on the debates surrounding the WAC. Writing in Nature Conor Cruise O'Brien argued that the boycott of South African academics had done nothing to influence the apartheid regime in South Africa while encouraging the curtailing of academic freedom of speech including in other African countries. John Collis argued that 'For WAC the message is also clear. If it wishes to be an organization which can speak authoritatively for archaeology and not be dismissed as left wing organization it has got to attract back the bulk of those of us who withdrew and this means resolving the question of open participation. If it does not it will lack the moral and political authority to speak for archaeology and therefore will not be heeded where it needs to be heard most. Reviews contemplated whether the book represented an ego-trip by Ucko. J. Desmond Clark wrote that the book is 'interesting as detailed account of how determined individual dealt with what promised to be difficult situation in such way as to give the impression however erroneous of being the organizer of humanitarian crusade. On the other hand Larry J. Zimmerman commented thatas archeologists we will face personal political decisions that are bound to affect our practice. Ucko demonstrates this with extraordinary courage and candor document- ing personal insight and growth in ways uncommon to our profession. His weaknesses and strengths his biases and his passion for archeology are apparent throughout. Some will call the book an ego trip but thinking archeologists will see bit of their own personal struggle in it. References.

He is the son of professional wrestler Bob Orton Sr. the brother of professional wrestler Barry Orton and the father of professional wrestler Randy Orton. He is best known for his time in the WWF World Wrestling Federation now WWE. He has also wrestled for several promotions in the United States Japan and other countries. Early life Bob Orton Jr. was born in Kansas City Missouri and is the son of professional wrestler Bob Orton Sr. Professional wrestling career Championship Wrestling from Florida 1972–1980 Orton trained with Hiro Matsuda after dropping out of college and at the age of 22 Orton made his debut in the promotion Championship Wrestling from Florida in 1972 with the ring name of Young Mr. Wrestling wrestling in instances with his father Bob Orton Sr. They won the tag team title from the promotion. Orton was one of the first wrestlers to use the Superplex as his finishing maneuver. Orton in his early days in wrestling used gimmick of masked wrestler known as The Invader. He often used this gimmick until 1976. American Wrestling Association 1976 1978 1988 Orton spent time in Verne Gagne 's American Wrestling Association in 1976 and 1978 large portion of it under the tutelage of AWA MVP Manager Bobby Heenan. Orton feuded with Greg Gagne among others. Gagne-Orton was featured match on the AWA undercard for the Muhammad Ali-Antonio Inoki mixed martial arts match. Orton had brief stint back in the AWA in early 1988 following his November 1987 dismissal from the WWF during which he renewed his alliance with Adrian Adonis from the WWF. National Wrestling Alliance 1980–1982 Following experiencing success in the Florida Central States and Mid-South regions Orton competed in the National Wrestling Alliance in 1980-1981 using cowboy 's gimmick. While he competed in the NWA he won several matches and earned reputation as hard worker and legit tough wrestler. In 1982 he left the NWA to sign contract with the World Wrestling Federation. World Wrestling Federation 1982 In 1982 Orton competed in the World Wrestling Federation. He challenged Bob Backlund for the WWF Heavyweight Championship in Philadelphia winning by count-out the title can not change of hands by disqualification or count-out. They had lumberjack match month later again in Philadelphia but Orton was again unsuccessful. Their matches ran in some of the largest cities on the WWF circuit. Return to NWA 1982-1984 He returned to the NWA again in 1982 and captured the tag team title with Don Kernodle. The duo held the title for two months before succumbing to Wahoo McDaniel and Mark Youngblood. Together with Dick Slater he had feud with Ric Flair. Orton and Slater interfered in Flair 's return match against NWA World Champion Harley Race who had beaten Flair for the title. They attacked Flair with an aided piledriver which caused Flair severe injury in the neck and put Flair out of wrestling for several months thus collecting bounty placed on Flair 's head by Race who was reluctant to wrestle Flair in return matches for the title. In the run-up to this incident Orton had been portrayed as babyface and longtime friend of Flair his participation in the attack was thus portrayed as the betrayal of that friendship. Flair would eventually return in late 1983 attacking both Orton and Slater with baseball bat before going on to win back the title from Race at Starrcade '83. Return to WWF 1984–1987 1989 1990 Orton re-joined the WWF in March 1984 for what would be the most famous run of his career. He was often addressed as Ace Orton by Roddy Piper and was Piper 's bodyguard. His other gimmick wearing cast during his matches stemmed from legitimately having his left forearm broken in match with Jimmy Snuka at the 1985 event The War to Settle the Score in Madison Square Garden. Although the injury healed in real life the cast gimmick involved Orton—on doctor 's orders —continuing to wear the cast claiming the injury had not healed Orton instead would use the cast to his advantage striking his opponents behind the referee 's back. He won several matches with the cast and without the cast. In 1984 Orton was the contender to the WWF Intercontinental Championship eventually wrestling then-current champion Tito Santana. Orton was successful in winning untelevised matches and events against Santana but Orton mostly won by either count-out or disqualification. Orton would also be successful in defeating Santana in non-title bouts but Santana ultimately remained as the champ and Santana eventually got the upper hand in the feud. Orton would also engage in bitter feud with Jimmy Snuka through 1985 and 1986. Orton just like with Santana managed to achieve victories over Snuka but mainly in untelevised shows. Just like his feud with Santana Snuka would get the upper hand in the feud. Orton was involved in the main event of the first WrestleMania at Madison Square Garden in 1985 being in the corner of Piper and 'Mr. Wonderful Paul Orndorff in their match against Hulk Hogan and Mr. T. Orton accidentally cost his team the match after an attempted cheat backfired resulting in him hitting Orndorff with the cast. Orton also competed in the main event against WWF Champion Hulk Hogan on Saturday Night 's Main Event on NBC broadcast May 11 1985 which he lost by disqualification due to the interference of Piper. Orton took part in the 1985 King of the Ring tournament on July he fought Paul Orndorff to double disqualification Orton remained with Piper for the remainder of 1985 feuding with Orndorff and variety of partners such as Hogan André the Giant and Bruno Sammartino. In early 1986 Orndorff began wearing cast as neutralizer and the WWF ordered both men to remove their casts. Also in late 1985 and early 1986 Orton challenged Hogan for the WWF Heavyweight Championship like his matches four years earlier against Backlund Orton was not successful. On June 30 at house show held on Bloomington Minnesota Orton and Piper surprisingly scored an upset victory over Orndorff and Hogan albeit by DQ this event also would be the first time Orton got victory over Hogan as previous matches between them typically saw Hogan winning. Orton was dubbed Boxing Bob and Battling Bob in early 1986 after the cast came off and fought Mr. at Saturday Night 's Main Event which served as setup for the Piper-Mr. match at WrestleMania. Prior to WrestleMania Boxing Bob Orton defeated Jose Luis Rivera in boxing match. At WrestleMania Orton was introduced as Ace in Comedy and Funnyman by guest ring announcer Joan Rivers who misread the card. Piper and Orton went their separate ways after WrestleMania with Piper taking hiatus and Orton in the meantime becoming the bodyguard for Piper 's talk-segment successor Adorable Adrian Adonis Adonis had Orton wear pink cowboy hat. When Piper returned later in 1986 to reclaim his talk show segment turning face in the process Orton betrayed his long-time friend sparking violent feud between Piper and Orton and his new partners which typically saw Piper winning. During this time Orton formed tag team with The Magnificent Muraco with the duo managed by Mr. Fuji and sometimes Jimmy Hart. During their first years as team the team of Muraco and Orton was given fairly decent push and both were able to easily defeat preliminary wrestlers when not teaming. They appeared at the opening match at WrestleMania III losing to the Can-Am Connection Rick Martel and Tom Zenk. The team of Muraco and Orton also got into series of matches with The Killer Bees team composed of B. Brian Blair and Jumpin Jim Brunzell. Both teams exchanged victories at televised events but ultimately the Bees got the upper hand at untelevised events. Referee Danny Davis would usually disqualify the Bees as part of his heel gimmick. They along Tiger Chung Lee were notable for being the first team to lose to The Young Stallions team composed by Jim Powers and Paul Roma alongside Tito Santana. By 1987 the team of Muraco and Orton was clearly stepping down the card. While they were still able to defeat preliminary teams Orton and Muraco would usually find themselves on the losing end to upper-card teams. Orton and Muraco then eventually started arguing during their matches which also caused them to lose credibility as team. This finally led to match on WWF Superstars of Wrestling where Orton caused him and Muraco to lose match when Orton kept Muraco from performing Superplex which was Orton 's finishing move. Orton felt offended that Muraco was trying to steal his hold. This led to brawl between both wrestlers that took place inside and outside the ring. On September 1987 Orton and Muraco finally faced off at WWF house show. This match ended in double disqualification. Orton and Muraco faced off during the late months of 1987. By this point the team was essentially disbanded with the now turned face The Rock Magnificent Muraco getting the upper hand in the feud. During Orton 's feud with Muraco Mr. Fuji would return to manage Orton Muraco dumped Mr. Fuji as his manager following his face turn. Orton 's last televised match and victory as whole in the WWF came on October 10 1987 in heated victory against preliminary wrestler Siva Afi. Orton 's last match with the WWF came on November 1987 where Orton fought preliminary wrestler Sam Houston to draw in his home state of Missouri. Orton was fired after this for getting arrested for causing disturbance at Calgary airport.In 1989 Orton attempted to make comeback to the WWF losing to Ted DiBiase in WWF house show at Springfield MI on October 11. However no contract was ever offered to him.By 1990 Orton was wrestling for the Arena Wrestling Alliance promotion. As the AWA had an agreement with the WWF to exchange talent Orton made appearances for the WWF at three house show-matches. All took place in New Zealand. Orton was also scheduled to make an appearance for WWF show in Madison Square Garden in January 1990 against Bret Hart but that was cancelled. Then Orton would depart from the company for 15 years before returning in 2005. New Japan Pro-Wrestling 1988–1989 After leaving the WWF Orton took short hiatus from wrestling inactive until 1988 when Orton travelled to Japan. During this time he wrestled for New Japan Pro-Wrestling working with his brother Barry and they formed the team of the Gaspar Brothers two hockey-masked pirates with Bob using the ring name of Billy Gaspar while Barry called himself Barry Gaspar. They won several matches together beating the teams of Nobuhiko Takada and Antonio Inoki Kuniaki Kobayashi and Riki Choshu Osamu Kido and Yoshiaki Fujiwara Hiro Saito and Super Strong Machine and many others. After the team of the Gaspar Brothers ended Orton briefly teamed with Dick Murdoch and Scott Hall in NJPW for the Japan Cup Elimination League. After wrestling few more matches in 1989 with low number of victories Orton left New Japan. World Championship Wrestling 1989 On March 30 1989 Orton made his debut with then National Wrestling Alliance member World Championship Wrestling. Wrestling at WCW Saturday Night taping in Atlanta Georgia and managed by Gary Hart Orton defeated Shane Douglas. On the April episode of Saturday Night it was announced that Orton would be facing his former partner Dick Murdoch at the upcoming Clash of Champions VI. The following day at the Clash Orton defeated Murdoch after Gary Hart interfered. He then went on house show tour facing mostly preliminary opposition. On April 14 in Milwaukee Wisconsin Orton suffered his first defeat falling to Mike Justice. Murdoch challenged Orton to bullrope match after he had interfered in one of Orton 's matches in which Orton defeated Trent Knight. He lost to Murdoch at the 1989 Wrestlewar in the bullrope match. Shortly after the match Orton 's manager Playboy Gary Hart started brawling with Murdoch and then Orton attacked Murdoch with the cowbell of the bullrope and threw him out of the ring choking him and attacking the referees that were trying to stop him in the process. After his release Orton made one-time appearance at WCW house show in Kiel Missouri defeating Dutch Mantell. Second return to WWE 2005–2006 On February 2005 Bob Orton was announced as 2005 inductee into the WWE Hall of Fame. In the weeks preceding WrestleMania 21 Orton became entangled in his son Randy 's feud with The Undertaker. During an episode of SmackDown Orton begged The Undertaker to show mercy on his son in order to distract The Undertaker long enough for his son to sneak into the ring and hit the RKO. At WrestleMania he unsuccessfully interfered in the match between Orton and The Undertaker striking The Undertaker with his cast. On August 21 2005 at SummerSlam Orton interfered in rematch between Randy and The Undertaker this time enabling his son to defeat The Undertaker. Orton then began accompanying Randy to ringside during his matches and teamed with his son at No Mercy on October 2005 defeating The Undertaker in handicap casket match. The Ortons teamed together once again on the October 28 2005 episode of SmackDown joining forces with Ken Kennedy to face Roddy Piper Batista and Eddie Guerrero in six-man tag team match. The match ended in defeat for the Ortons when Orton succumbed to Piper 's sleeper hold. On the December 16 2005 episode of SmackDown Orton disguised himself as one of the Undertaker 's druids and carried The Undertaker 's signature urn to ringside as The Undertaker came to the ring to confront Randy. Orton remained at ringside after the other druids had left distracting The Undertaker and enabling Randy to attack him. Orton then handed Randy the urn which Randy used to knock The Undertaker unconscious. At Armageddon Orton still holding the urn accompanied Randy to ringside for his Hell in Cell match with The Undertaker. He interfered in the match several times but was ultimately unable to prevent The Undertaker from delivering Tombstone Piledriver to both Ortons and then covering Randy for the win.

He also appeared on the April 10 2012 episode of WWE SmackDown and was attacked by Kane offscreen who had been feuding with his son Randy at the time. Orton appeared once again on June 18 2017 at the Money in the Bank Pay-per-view situated in the front row of the crowd along with fellow Hall of Famers Ric Flair and Sgt. Slaughter. During the match between his son Randy and Jinder Mahal he would be assaulted by the Singh brothers as they were ejected from ringside this prompted Randy to attack the Singh brothers. However this distraction proved enough for Jinder to hit Randy with the Khallas for the victory. Personal life Orton is married to Elaine Orton nurse at Christian Hospital NE in Missouri and they have two sons Randy also professional wrestler Nathan stand-up comedian and daughter Becky. His first grandchild was born on July 12 2008 when son Randy and his now ex-wife Samantha had their first child daughter Alanna. On an episode of WWE Confidential he admitted that his forearm injury in the 1985 match with Jimmy Snuka was not work and did not heal when he wore the cast. It would n't heal fully until he left the WWF in 1987. Around 1986 Orton was involved in an incident in Fresno California where the Fresno Police Department were called for an incident involving Orton and Roddy Piper in hotel. Orton would end up naked and drunk on the roof of the hotel and would be shot three times with police tasers according to Orton himself. Health As teenager Orton was diagnosed with hepatitis but apparently showed no apparent symptoms and would eventually no longer recall having the disease. Over 30 years later in the midst of his feud with his son Randy against The Undertaker Orton was retested and it was confirmed that he still carried the disease. The Undertaker was furious that he was uninformed of Orton 's illness and learned that former Head of Talent Relations John Laurinaitis who knew of Orton 's disease allowed him to blade as at one point in the feud during Hell in Cell match at Armageddon 2005 Orton spilled blood directly onto him which could have caused him to contract the disease. This was the main reason Orton was let go by WWE in February 2006.

This chapter functions as transition from the former account that is Gospel of Luke with narrative prelude verses 1–5 repeated record of the ascension of Jesus Christ with more detail verses 6–11 and the meeting of Jesus followers verses 12-26 until before Pentecost. Text The original text was written in Koine Greek and is divided into 26 verses. Textual witnesses Some early manuscripts containing the text of this chapter are Codex Vaticanus AD 325–350 Codex Sinaiticus 330–360 Codex Bezae ~400 Codex Alexandrinus 400–440 Codex Ephraemi Rescriptus ~450 extant verses 3–26 Papyrus 56 5th/6th century Codex Laudianus ~550 Old Testament references Acts 1:20 Psalm 69:25 Psalm 109:8 New Testament references Acts 1:1-3 Luke 1:1-4 Locations This chapter mentions the following places Bethany Jerusalem Judea Mount of Olives Samaria Introduction 1:1–5 The beginning of the book follows conventional opening statement containing the name of the addressee Theophilus and brief reminder of the content of the former account Gospel of Luke by the same author. Verses 1–3 1The former account made Theophilus of all that Jesus began both to do and teach 2until the day in which He was taken up after He through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom He had chosen 3to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many infallible proofs being seen by them during forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God. Former account from Greek πρῶτον λόγον próton logon lit. first book refers to Gospel of Luke. Theophilus written in Greek in vocative word form the intended reader of this book as well as the previous one Luke 1:3 might be patron who is already informed about things which have been fulfilled among us but still needs assurance to know the certainty of those things Luke 1:1-4. Ascension of Jesus 1:6–12 This section records that forty days after the resurrection Jesus commands the disciples during meal to await the coming of the Holy Spirit then cloud takes him upward from sight and two men in white appear to tell them the disciples that he will return in the same way you have seen him go into heaven. Verse Jesus says But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you and you shall be witnesses to Me in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria and to the end of the earth. Before Jesus left he charged the disciples with the task of acting as 'witnesses to him in the locations that can be read as 'geographical program for the whole book of Acts The first chapters set in Jerusalem Chapter 8—11 record the spread of the gospel to the surrounding areas within Syria-Palestine 'Judea and Samaria Chapter 13 onwards following Paul 's mission ever farther places.Luke chapter 24 tells how Jesus leads the eleven disciples as far as Bethany village on the Mount of Olives where he instructs them to remain in Jerusalem until the coming of the Holy Spirit And it came to pass while he blessed them he parted from them and was carried up into heaven. And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy Luke 24:51-52 .The Gospel of John has three references to ascension in Jesus own words No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven the son of man John 3:13 What if you the disciples were to see the son of man ascending where he was before. John 6:62 and to Mary Magdalene after his resurrection Do not hold me for not yet ascended to my father ... John 20:17. Various epistles Romans 8:34 Ephesians 1:19–20 Colossians 3:1 Philippians 2:9–11 Timothy 3:16 and Peter 3:21–22 also refer to an ascension in relation to the post-resurrection exaltation of Jesus to the right hand of God. Gospel of Mark Mark 16:19 contains the brief ascension account but it is considered by broad consensus among scholars to be later addition to the original version of that gospel. Verse 12 Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the hill called the Mount of Olives Sabbath day walk from the city. The hill called the Mount of Olives ESV the mount called Olivet This geographical site is mentioned by Luke alone in the narrative of Jesus last entry into Jerusalem Luke 19:29 and as place to rest during Jesus final ministry of teaching Luke 21:37. Luke 24:50 names Bethany as the site of ascension which is identified in Luke 19:29 as location at the Mount of Olives. Sabbath day 's walk Greek Σαββάτου ὁδὸν 2000 cubits furlongs about 5/8 mile or about kilometer showing proximity to Jerusalem fulfilling Jesus command in Luke 24:49 as well as portraying the disciples as faithful Jews cf. Luke 23:54-56. The distance seems differ significantly with the Bethany in John 11:18 but the ascension site according to Lightfoot was from the place where that tract of the Mount of Olives ceased to be called Bethphage and began to be called Bethany not inside the village 15 furlongs far in Gospel of John. Election of Matthias 1:13–26 As the disciples waited obediently in the upper room in Jerusalem for the promised coming of the Holy Spirit they devoted themselves with one accord in prayer verse 14 underlying the unity of the group which surprisingly now includes Jesus mother brothers and some women.Verse 13 lists the names of the apostles with some differences compared to the apostolic list in Luke 6:14-16 cf. Matthew 10:1-4 Mark 3:13-19 Andrew was moved down from the second place to the fourth place after John Thomas was moved up from the eighth place to the sixth place following Philip Judas Iscariot is no longer listed.The omission of Judas Iscariot motivates the narrative of his final fate and Peter 's call to find his replacement. The process begins by Peter 's appeal to the Scripture verse 20 and the requirements for the candidate verses 21–22. With this Peter reinforces the identity of the group and exerts his de facto authority in the group. Verse 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus and with His brothers. Mary the mother of Jesus was mentioned by name for the first time in Luke-Acts since the infancy narrative in Luke. Brothers or brothers and sisters translated from the plural Greek word adelphoi which depending on the context in New Testament usage may refer either to brothers or to brothers and sisters also verse 1:15 in some versions. Verse 15 In those days Peter stood up among the disciples the number of people together was about hundred and twenty and said Stood up from Greek ἀναστὰς adding participle to finite verb to stand to indicate the posture or position of speaker is characteristic of Luke as this word is found in the Gospel of Luke 17 times and in Acts 19 times only twice in Matthew six or seven times in Mark. Verses 21–22 Peter says 21Therefore of these men who have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us 22beginning 'arxamenos from the baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us one of these must become witness 'martyra with us of His resurrection. Went in and out is Semitism or Septuagintalism expression cf. Psalm 121:8 comparable to the English phrase comings and goings. Beginning Greek ἀρξάμενος arxamenos The baptism of John to that day when He was taken up from us ascension mark the scope for the story of Jesus with an emphasis on His resurrection. In Acts 10 Luke notes Peter preaching the gospel using precisely the same parameters also using arxamenos began with the claim of being witness accusative Greek μάρτυρα martyra plural martyres specifically to the resurrection Acts 10:36-42. Peter preaches to Cornelius and his household 36The word which God sent to the children of Israel preaching peace through Jesus Christ—He is Lord of all— 37that word you know which was proclaimed throughout all Judea and began 'arxamenos from Galilee after the baptism which John preached 38how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power who went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil for God was with Him. 39And we are witnesses 'martyres of all things which He did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem whom they killed by hanging on tree. 40Him God raised up on the third day and showed Him openly 41not to all the people but to witnesses chosen before by God even to us who ate and drank with Him after He arose from the dead. 42And He commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that it is He who was ordained by God to be Judge of the living and the dead. 43To Him all the prophets witness that through His name whoever believes in Him will receive remission of sins. The apostles proceed by asking God as the only resource to 'indicate his choice through the casting of lots verse 26 which is familiar mean to ascertain divine purpose in both the Graeco-Roman world and the Bible to get Matthias numbered with the eleven apostles verse 26. Verse 26 And they cast their lots and the lot fell on Matthias. And he was numbered with the eleven apostles. Matthias only mentioned in this chapter in the whole Bible he was chosen by casting lots to be included as the Twelve replacing Judas Iscariot from then on.

Cases first started appearing in 2004 primarily in Thailand and Taiwan. Signs and symptoms At least one physician associates the symptoms with tuberculosis. Some lethal overwhelming infections are reported aggravating people who already suffer other conditions such as HIV/AIDS. Clinical manifestations can involve symptoms similar to Generalized pustular psoriasis. Cause Little is publicly known about the underlying factors causing the disease. Genetic factors are suspected but the disease does not appear to be heritable. One specific gene hypothesized to be involved in the disorder is SERPINA1. Also something in the environment may trigger the disease. Mechanism An elevated concentration of autoantibodies that block interferon-gamma was detected in most patients. Diagnosis Treatment Society and culture The swash.com website uses AIDS 2.0 as the moniker for maybe another apparently highly contagious AIDS-like condition described by The Epoch Times.The Daily Beast has described this disease emphatically as not AIDS 2.0.

Afghan cameleers in Australia,Afghan cameleers in Australia also known as Afghans Pashto افغانان or Ghans Pashto غانز were camel drivers who worked in Outback Australia from the 1860s to the 1930s. Small groups of cameleers were shipped in and out of Australia at three-year intervals to service the Australian inland pastoral industry by carting goods and transporting wool bales by camel trains. They were commonly referred to as Afghans even though lot of them originated from the far western parts of British India primarily Balochistan and the NWFP now Pakistan which was inhabited by ethnic Pashtuns and Balochs. Nonetheless many were from Afghanistan itself as well. In addition there were also some with origins in Egypt and Turkey. The majority of cameleers including cameleers from British India were Muslim while sizeable minority were Sikhs from the Punjab region. They set up camel-breeding stations and rest-house outposts known as caravanserai throughout inland Australia creating permanent link between the coastal cities and the remote cattle and sheep grazing stations until about the 1930s when they were largely replaced by the automobile. They included members of the Pashtun Baloch and Sindhi ethnic groups from south-central Asia present-day Iran Afghanistan and Pakistan others from the Punjabi Kashmir and Rajasthan regions of the Indian subcontinent as well as people from Egypt Iraq Syria and Turkey. They provided vital support to exploration communications and settlement in the arid interior of the country where the climate was too harsh for horses. They also played major role in establishing Islam in Australia building the country 's first mosque at Marree in South Australia in 1861 the Central Adelaide Mosque the first permanent mosque in Adelaide still in use today and several mosques in Western Australia. Many of the cameleers and their families later returned to their homelands but many remained and turned to other trades and ways of making living. Today many people can trace their ancestry back to the early cameleers many of whom intermarried with local Aboriginal women and European women in outback Australia.,"Afghan cameleers in Australia also known as Afghans Pashto افغانان or Ghans Pashto غانز were camel drivers who worked in Outback Australia from the 1860s to the 1930s.

Many of the cameleers and their families later returned to their homelands but many remained and turned to other trades and ways of making living. Today many people can trace their ancestry back to the early cameleers many of whom intermarried with local Aboriginal women and European women in outback Australia. History Beginnings The various colonies of Australia being under the dominion of the British Empire the early settlers used people from British territories particularly Asia as navigators. In 1838 Joseph Bruce and John Gleeson brought out 18 of the first Afghans who arrived in the colony of South Australia in 1838. The first camel which became known as Harry arrived at Port Adelaide in 1840 and was used in an 1846 expedition by John Horrocks. It proved its worth as pack animal but unfortunately caused Horrocks death by accidental shooting so was later put down. Camels had been used successfully in desert exploration in other parts of the world but by 1859 only seven camels had been imported into Australia. In 1858 George James Landells who was known for exporting horses to India was commissioned by the Victorian Exploration Committee to buy camels and recruit camel drivers. Eight or three cameleers arrived in Melbourne from Karachi on the ship Chinsurah on June 1860 with shipment of 24 camels for the Burke and Wills expedition. These were used in the Burke and Wills expeditions. In 1866 Samuel Stuckey went to Karachi and imported more than 100 camels as well as 31 men. In the 1860s about 3,000 camel drivers came to Australia from Afghanistan and the Indian sub-continent along with more camels.Although the cameleers came from different ethnic groups and range of regions mostly Baluchistan Kashmir Sind and Punjab parts of present-day Pakistan Afghanistan north-western India and eastern Iran with few from Egypt and Turkey they were known collectively as Afghans later shortened to Ghans. Ethnic groups included Pashtun Punjabi Baloch or Baluch and Sindhis from the region between the southern Hindu Kush in Afghanistan and the Indus River in what is now Pakistan as well as others fewer in number from Kashmir Rajasthan Egypt Persia and Turkey. Most practised Islam and many blended this with their local customs in particular the Pashtun code of honour. Use of camels Before the building of railways and the widespread adoption of motor vehicles camels were the primary means of transporting goods in the Outback where the climate was too harsh for horses and other beasts of burden. From 1850 to 1900 the cameleers played an important part in opening up Central Australia helping to build the Australian Overland Telegraph Line between Adelaide and Darwin and also the railways. The camels hauled the supplies and their handlers erected fences acted as guides for several major expeditions and supplied almost every inland mine or station with its goods and services.The majority of cameleers arrived in Australia alone leaving wives and families behind to work on three-year contracts. Those who were not given living quarters on station such as on Thomas Elder 's Beltana generally lived away from white populations at first in camps and later in Ghantowns near existing settlements. thriving Afghan community lived at Marree South Australia then also known as Hergott Springs leading to the nicknames Little Asia or Little Afghanistan. When rail reached Oodnadatta the caravans travelled between there and Alice Springs formerly known as Stuart. There were caravanserais for the camel caravans travelling from Queensland New South Wales and Alice Springs. There was more acceptance by the local Aboriginal people and some cameleers married local Aboriginal women and started families in Australia. However some married European women and writer Ernestine Hill wrote of white women who had joined the Afghan community and converted to Islam even making the pilgrimage to Mecca.In 1873 Mahomet Saleh accompanied explorer Peter Warburton to Western Australia. Three Afghans helped William Christie Gosse to find way from the Finke River to Perth. Two years later Saleh assisted Ernest Giles on an expedition and J.W. Lewis used camels when surveying the country north-east of Lake Eyre in 1874 and 1875. In the 1880s camels were used by police in northern South Australia for the collection of statistics and census forms as well as other kinds of work and the Marree police used camels on patrol until 1949. At Finke/Aputula just over the border in the Northern Territory the last camel police patrol was in 1953.In the 1890s camels were used extensively in the Western Australian Goldfields to transport food water machinery and other supplies. In 1898 there were 300 Muslims in Coolgardie.During the Federation Drought which devastated eastern Australia from 1895 to 1902 the camels and their drivers were indispensable. John Edwards wrote to the Attorney-General in 1902 It is no exaggeration to say that if it had not been for the Afghan and his camels Wilcannia White Cliffs Tibooburra Milperinka and other towns ... would have practically ceased to exist. Success and discrimination By the turn of the century Muslim entrepreneurs dominated the camel business including Fuzzly Ahmed Port Augusta–Oodnadatta then Broken Hill and Faiz Mahomet Marree and Coolgardie. Abdul Wade also known as Wadi Wabed Wahid was especially successful in New South Wales and bought and set up the Wangamanna station as camel breeding and carrying business. He married the widow Emily Ozadelle and they had seven children. Wade worked hard at fitting in and being seen as an equal to his Australian peers dressing in the European style educating his children at top private schools and becoming naturalised citizen. However his attempts were ridiculed and at the end of the camel era he sold up and returned to Afghanistan. By 1901 there were an estimated 2000–4000 cameleers in Australia. Many of them made regular trips home to deal with family matters.While outback settlers farmers and others who had dealings with the Afghans often vouched for them finding that they held many values in common prejudice arose and discriminatory legislation was introduced by colonial state and federal governments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. One example was 1895 law which prevented Afghans from mining on the WA goldfields after tensions arose between the communities and Afghans were accused of polluting waterholes although no evidence was ever found for this. In The Ballad of Abdul Wade 2022 author Ryan Butta tells of how Abdul Wade was attacked by people who saw him as threat to their business interests despite his contributions to the community including offering hundreds of his camels to add to Australia 's contribution to World War in 1914. Cameleers saved Cunnamulla residents from semi-starvation after floods cut the town off from all other modes of transport in 1890. Yet in 1892 The Bulletin published an editorial saying the imported Asiatic ... is another cheap labour curse in land where such curses are already much too plentiful .Many cameleers were refused naturalisation and found themselves refused entry when they tried to return to Australia after visits home based on the Immigration Restriction Act 1901. In 1903 petition was raised about number of discriminatory practices but nothing came of it. The last of the cameleers Through the 1930s and 1940s with no employment and sometimes hostile community many cameleers returned to their homelands but others remained and developed trades and other means of making living. In 1952 small number of ancient turbaned men supposedly as old as 117 were to be found at the Adelaide mosque.It is recorded that the first person to make deposit his life savings of £29 in the newly-formed Savings Bank of South Australia on 11 March 1848 was an Afghan shepherd with his name recorded as Croppo Sing. Impact and legacy From the mid 1800s through to the early 1900s camels and cameleers were significant contributors to the wool industry the mining industry the construction of the Overland Telegraph and the rabbit-proof fence and transporting water to wherever it was needed. However even though the Afghans help was greatly appreciated they were also subject to discrimination because of their religion and appearance and because of the competition they provided to European bullock ox and horse teamsters. Many of the European competitors were also cameleers and in 1903 European camel train owner in Wilcannia replaced all of his Afghan camel drivers with Europeans.Author Ryan Butta has highlighted the fact that the cameleers were rendered invisible in some of the popular mythologies and histories of Australia such as Banjo Paterson 's work. Paterson spent time in Bourke at the time the cameleers were an active part of the community and business there yet did not write about them.The passenger train which travels between Adelaide and Darwin is known as The Ghan formerly The Afghan Express as reference to the service the Afghans provided to the areas through which the train travels.After their use was superseded by modern transport many camels were shot by police but some cameleers released their camels into the wild rather than allow them to be shot and large population of feral camels remains from this time.Date palms planted wherever the Afghans went are another legacy of the cameleers. Another understudied legacy of the cameleers is the traces of Sufism introduced across Australia evident in the remaining artefacts particularly prayer beads some books and letters belonging to the cameleers. Descendants fourth-generation descendant of Baluch cameleer who settled in Geraldton Western Australia set up sheep station and married an Aboriginal woman is proud of her heritage on both sides. She says that it was difficult for her ancestor to acquire permanent residence and permission to marry but the Afghans were honourable men who preferred to marry rather than rape local women.Several descendants in Adelaide formed the Australian Outback Afghan Camelmen Descendants and Friends Memorial Committee which organised memorial in 2007. They included Janice Taverner née Mahomet Mona Wilson née Akbar Eric Sultan Abdul Bejah son of Jack Bejah and grandson of Dervish Bejah Lil Hassan née Fazulla and Don Aziz.Marree still has the longest-surviving Ghantown and many descendants of the original cameleers still live there. Memorials There is memorial at Whitmore Square Adelaide which pays homage to the city 's Afghan camel drivers called Voyagers and created by South Australian artist Shaun Kirby and his company Thylacine Art Projects. It was unveiled on the night of 11 December 2007 so that the lighting of the sculpture could be appreciated. It is in the shape of crescent evocative of sand dunes in the deserts of South Australia as well as the Hilal crescent moon associated with Islam. The curved wall is covered with handmade rippled tiles produced at the JamFactory. There is red metalwork decorative screen with traditional Islamic patterning on the front of the crescent. The memorial does not have plaque but there is small stone obelisk in front of the crescent wall with Arabic writing.There is also bronze plaque honouring Bejah Dervish on the Jubilee 150 Walkway on North Terrace. It reads Dervish Bejah c1862-1957 Camel-driver explorer .A commemorative plaque for Faiz and Tagh Mahomet on St Georges Terrace in Perth acknowledges their contributions as camel owners and drivers in the 1890s in opening up the interior of Western Australia before the building of the railway. In film 2020 documentary The Afghan Cameleers in Australia directed by Afghan/Australian filmmaker Fahim Hashimy explores and records the relationships that many cameleers formed with Aboriginal women and their descendants.The 2020 drama feature film The Furnace is set during the gold rushes in Western Australia and highlights the roles of Afghan cameleers.Watandar My Countryman is documentary film directed by Jolyon Hoff and co-written and co-produced by Hazara photographer Muzafar Ali who arrived in Australia as refugee in 2015. The film which explores the concept of identity arose after Ali started investigating the long history of Afghan people in Australia. It premiered at the Adelaide Film Festival in October 2022. The film features Nici Cumpston artistic director of Tarnanthi and curator of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander art at the Art Gallery of South Australia. Mosques At first special room set aside in someone 's house served as places of prayer but as time went on the Muslim communities wanted to have dedicated places of worship.

It was released in 1991 as his debut album for Elektra Nonesuch Records. Critical reception In The Village Voice 's annual Pazz Jop critics poll for the year 's best albums After Awhile placed at number 13.The Chicago Tribune 's music critic Greg Kot hailed it as one of the year 's best albums and wrote in Trouser Press that it wasn until After Awhile that Gilmore 's unique style became fully apparent. For the first time the breadth of his writing is on display ... For all the high-minded aspirations in the music Gilmore never turns into cosmic cowboy not for nothing is he fond of quoting Ezra Pound 's maxim that 'The poem fails when it strays too far from the song and the song fails when it strays too far from the dance. The music on After Awhile embodies that synergy between heart intellect and groove. The New Rolling Stone Album Guide praised After Awhile for vaulting Gilmore into the ranks of some of the Lone Star state 's finest troubadours while observing that the album finds Gilmore liberated from the strictures of dancehall stage free to serve song over form in the spirit of folk artist rather than an entertainer. Mark Deming from AllMusic gave the record 4.5-star rating calling it subtle unforced masterpiece that captures Gilmore at the subtle peak of his abilities.

He has since appeared in feature films television shows comics and other media. He has appeared in more films than any other cartoon character is the ninth most-portrayed film personality in the world and has his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Development According to Chase Craig who wrote and drew the first Bugs Bunny comic Sunday pages and the first Bugs comic book Bugs was not the creation of any one man however he rather represented the creative talents of perhaps five or six directors and many cartoon writers including Charlie Thorson. In those days the stories were often the work of group who suggested various gags bounced them around and finalized them in joint story conference. Bugs-like rabbit with some of the personality of finalized Bugs though looking very different was originally featured in the film Porky 's Hare Hunt released on April 30 1938. It was co-directed by Ben Bugs Hardaway and an uncredited director Cal Dalton who was responsible for the initial design of the rabbit. This cartoon has an almost identical plot to Avery 's Porky 's Duck Hunt 1937 which had introduced Daffy Duck. Porky Pig is again cast as hunter tracking silly prey who is more interested in driving his pursuer insane and less interested in escaping. Hare Hunt replaces the little black duck with small white rabbit. According to Friz Freleng Hardaway and Dalton had decided to dress the duck in rabbit suit. The white rabbit had an oval head and shapeless body. In characterization he was rural buffoon. Mel Blanc gave the character voice and laugh much like those he later used for Woody Woodpecker. He was loud zany with goofy guttural laugh. The rabbit character was popular enough with audiences that the Termite Terrace staff decided to use it again.The rabbit comes back in Prest-O Change-O 1939 directed by Chuck Jones where he is the pet rabbit of unseen character Sham-Fu the Magician. Two dogs fleeing the local dogcatcher enter the rabbit 's absent master 's house. The rabbit harasses them but is ultimately bested by the bigger of the two dogs. This version of the rabbit was cool graceful and controlled. He retained the guttural laugh but was otherwise silent.The rabbit 's third appearance comes in Hare-um Scare-um 1939 directed again by Dalton and Hardaway. This cartoon—the first in which he is depicted as gray bunny instead of white one—is also notable as the rabbit 's first singing role. Charlie Thorson lead animator on the film gave the character name. He had written Bug 's Bunny on the model sheet that he drew for Hardaway. In promotional material for the cartoon including surviving 1939 presskit the name on the model sheet was altered to become the rabbit 's own name Bugs Bunny quotation marks only used on and off until 1944 .In his autobiography Blanc claimed that another proposed name for the character was Happy Rabbit. In the actual cartoons and publicity however the name Happy only seems to have been used in reference to Bugs Hardaway. In Hare-um Scare-um newspaper headline reads Happy Hardaway. Animation historian David Gerstein disputes that Happy Rabbit was ever used as an official name arguing that the only usage of the term came from Mel Blanc himself in humorous and fanciful tales he told about the character 's development in the 1970s and 1980s the name Bugs Bunny was used as early as August 1939 in the Motion Picture Herald in review for the short Hare-um Scare-um.Thorson had been approached by Tedd Pierce head of the story department and asked to design better rabbit. The decision was influenced by Thorson 's experience in designing hares. He had designed Max Hare in Toby Tortoise Returns Disney 1936. For Hardaway Thorson created the model sheet previously mentioned with six different rabbit poses. Thorson 's model sheet is comic rendition of the stereotypical fuzzy bunny. He had pear-shaped body with protruding rear end. His face was flat and had large expressive eyes. He had an exaggerated long neck gloved hands with three fingers oversized feet and smart aleck grin. The result was influenced by Walt Disney Animation Studios tendency to draw animals in the style of cute infants. He had an obvious Disney influence but looked like an awkward merger of the lean and streamlined Max Hare from The Tortoise and the Hare 1935 and the round soft bunnies from Little Hiawatha 1937 .In Jones Elmer 's Candid Camera 1940 the rabbit first meets Elmer Fudd. This time the rabbit looks more like the present-day Bugs taller and with similar face—but retaining the more primitive voice. Candid Camera 's Elmer character design is also different taller and chubbier in the face than the modern model though Arthur Q. Bryan 's character voice is already established. Official debut While Porky 's Hare Hunt was the first Warner Bros. cartoon to feature what would become Bugs Bunny Wild Hare directed by Tex Avery and released on July 27 1940 is widely considered to be the first official Bugs Bunny cartoon. It is the first film where both Elmer Fudd and Bugs both redesigned by Bob Givens are shown in their fully developed forms as hunter and tormentor respectively the first in which Mel Blanc uses what became Bugs standard voice and the first in which Bugs uses his catchphrase What 's up Doc. Wild Hare was huge success in theaters and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Cartoon Short Subject.For the film Avery asked Givens to remodel the rabbit. The result had closer resemblance to Max Hare. He had more elongated body stood more erect and looked more poised. If Thorson 's rabbit looked like an infant Givens version looked like an adolescent. Blanc gave Bugs the voice of city slicker. The rabbit was as audacious as he had been in Hare-um Scare-um and as cool and collected as in Prest-O Change-O.Immediately following on Wild Hare Bob Clampett 's Patient Porky 1940 features cameo appearance by Bugs announcing to the audience that 750 rabbits have been born. The gag uses Bugs Wild Hare visual design but his goofier pre-Wild Hare voice characterization. The second full-fledged role for the mature Bugs Chuck Jones Elmer 's Pet Rabbit 1941 is the first to use Bugs name on-screen it appears in title card featuring Bugs Bunny at the start of the film which was edited in following the success of Wild Hare. However Bugs voice and personality in this cartoon is noticeably different and his design was slightly altered as well Bugs visual design is based on the earlier version in Candid Camera but with yellow gloves and no buck teeth has lower-pitched voice and more aggressive arrogant and thuggish personality instead of fun-loving personality. After Pet Rabbit however subsequent Bugs appearances returned to normal the Wild Hare visual design and personality returned and Blanc re-used the Wild Hare voice characterization. Hiawatha 's Rabbit Hunt 1941 directed by Friz Freleng became the second Bugs Bunny cartoon to receive an Academy Award nomination. The fact that it did not win the award was later spoofed somewhat in What 's Cookin Doc. 1944 in which Bugs demands recount claiming to be victim of sa-bo-TAH-gee after losing the Oscar to James Cagney and presents clip from Hiawatha 's Rabbit Hunt to prove his point. World War II By 1942 Bugs had become the number one star of Merrie Melodies. The series was originally intended only for one-shot characters in films after several early attempts to introduce characters Foxy Goopy Geer and Piggy failed under Harman–Ising. By the mid-1930s under Leon Schlesinger Merrie Melodies started introducing newer characters. Bugs Bunny Gets the Boid 1942 shows slight redesign of Bugs with less-prominent front teeth and rounder head. The character was reworked by Robert McKimson then an animator in Clampett 's unit. The redesign at first was only used in the films created by Clampett 's unit but in time it was taken up by the other directors with Freleng and Frank Tashlin the first. For Tortoise Wins by Hare 1943 he created yet another version with more slanted eyes longer teeth and much larger mouth. He used this version until 1949 as did Art Davis for the one Bugs Bunny film he directed Bowery Bugs when he started using the version he had designed for Clampett. Jones came up with his own slight modification and the voice had slight variations between the units. Bugs also made cameos in Avery 's final Warner Bros. cartoon Crazy Cruise.Since Bugs debut in Wild Hare he appeared only in color Merrie Melodies films making him one of the few recurring characters created for that series in the Schlesinger era prior to the full conversion to color alongside Egghead Inki Sniffles and Elmer Fudd who actually co-existed in 1937 along with Egghead as separate character. While Bugs made cameo in Porky Pig 's Feat 1943 this was his only appearance in black-and-white Looney Tunes film. He did not star in Looney Tunes film until that series made its complete conversion to only color cartoons beginning in 1944. Buckaroo Bugs was Bugs first film in the Looney Tunes series and was also the last Warner Bros. cartoon to credit Schlesinger as he had retired and sold his studio to Warner Bros. that year .Bugs popularity soared during World War II because of his free and easy attitude and he began receiving special star billing in his cartoons by 1943. By that time Warner Bros. had become the most profitable cartoon studio in the United States. In company with cartoon studios such as Disney and Famous Studios Warners pitted its characters against Adolf Hitler Benito Mussolini Francisco Franco and the Japanese. Bugs Bunny Nips the Nips 1944 features Bugs at odds with group of Japanese soldiers. This cartoon has since been pulled from distribution due to its depiction of Japanese people. One US Navy propaganda film saved from destruction features the voice of Mel Blanc in Tokyo Woes 1945 about the propaganda radio host Tokyo Rose. He also faces off against Hermann Göring and Hitler in Herr Meets Hare 1945 which introduced his well-known reference to Albuquerque as he mistakenly winds up in the Black Forest of 'Joimany instead of Las Vegas Nevada. Bugs also appeared in the 1942 two-minute U.S. war bonds commercial film Any Bonds Today along with Porky and Elmer. At the end of Super-Rabbit 1943 Bugs appears wearing United States Marine Corps dress blue uniform. As result the Marine Corps made Bugs an honorary Marine master sergeant. From 1943 to 1946 Bugs was the official mascot of Kingman Army Airfield Kingman Arizona where thousands of aerial gunners were trained during World War II. Some notable trainees included Clark Gable and Charles Bronson. Bugs also served as the mascot for 530 Squadron of the 380th Bombardment Group 5th Air Force U.S. Air Force which was attached to the Royal Australian Air Force and operated out of Australia 's Northern Territory from 1943 to 1945 flying B-24 Liberator bombers. Bugs riding an air delivered torpedo served as the squadron logo for Marine Torpedo/Bomber Squadron 242 in the Second World War. Additionally Bugs appeared on the nose of B-24J 42-110157 in both the 855th Bomb Squadron of the 491st Bombardment Group Heavy and later in the 786th BS of the 466th BG both being part of the 8th Air Force operating out of England. In 1944 Bugs Bunny made cameo appearance in Jasper Goes Hunting Puppetoons film produced by rival studio Paramount Pictures. In this cameo animated by McKimson with Blanc providing the usual voice Bugs after being threatened at gunpoint pops out of rabbit hole saying his usual catchphrase after hearing the orchestra play the wrong theme song he realizes Hey 'm in the wrong picture. and then goes back in the hole. Bugs also made cameo in the Private Snafu short Gas in which he is found stowed away in the titular private 's belongings his only spoken line is his usual catchphrase. Although it was usually Porky Pig who brought the Looney Tunes films to close with his stuttering That 's all folks. Bugs replaced him at the end of Hare Tonic and Baseball Bugs bursting through drum just as Porky did but munching on carrot and saying in his Bronx/Brooklyn accent And that 's the end. Post-World War II era After World War II Bugs continued to appear in numerous Warner Bros. cartoons making his last Golden Age appearance in False Hare 1964. He starred in over 167 theatrical short films most of which were directed by Friz Freleng Robert McKimson and Chuck Jones. Freleng 's Knighty Knight Bugs 1958 in which medieval Bugs trades blows with Yosemite Sam and his fire-breathing dragon which has cold won an Academy Award for Best Cartoon Short Subject becoming the first and only Bugs Bunny cartoon to win said award. Three of Jones films—Rabbit Fire Rabbit Seasoning and Duck. Rabbit Duck —compose what is often referred to as the Rabbit Season/Duck Season trilogy and were the origins of the rivalry between Bugs and Daffy Duck. Jones classic What 's Opera Doc. 1957 casts Bugs and Elmer Fudd in parody of Richard Wagner 's Der Ring des Nibelungen. It was deemed culturally significant by the United States Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the National Film Registry in 1992 becoming the first cartoon short to receive this honor.In the fall of 1960 ABC debuted the prime-time television program The Bugs Bunny Show. This show packaged many of the post-1948 Warners cartoons with newly animated wraparounds. Throughout its run the series was highly successful and helped cement Warner Bros. Animation as mainstay of Saturday-morning cartoons. After two seasons it was moved from its evening slot to reruns on Saturday mornings. The Bugs Bunny Show changed format and exact title frequently but remained on network television for 40 years. The packaging was later completely different with each cartoon simply presented on its own title and all though some clips from the new bridging material were sometimes used as filler. Later years Bugs did not appear in any of the post-1964 Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies films produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises or Seven Arts Productions nor did he appear in Filmation 's Daffy Duck and Porky Pig Meet the Groovie Goolies. He did however have two cameo appearances in the 1974 Joe Adamson short Political Cartoon one at the beginning of the short and another in which he is interviewed at pet store. Bugs was animated in this short by Mark Kausler. He did not appear in new material on-screen again until Bugs and Daffy 's Carnival of the Animals aired in 1976. From the late 1970s through the early 1990s Bugs was featured in various animated specials for network television such as Bugs Bunny 's Thanksgiving Diet Bugs Bunny 's Easter Special Bugs Bunny 's Looney Christmas Tales and Bugs Bunny 's Bustin Out All Over. Bugs also starred in several theatrical compilation features during this time including the United Artists distributed documentary Bugs Bunny Superstar 1975 and Warner Bros. own releases The Bugs Bunny/Road Runner Movie 1979 The Looney Looney Looney Bugs Bunny Movie 1981 Bugs Bunny 's 3rd Movie 1001 Rabbit Tales 1982 and Daffy Duck 's Quackbusters 1988. In the 1988 live-action/animated comedy Who Framed Roger Rabbit Bugs appeared as one of the inhabitants of Toontown. However since the film was being produced by Disney Warner Bros. would only allow the use of their biggest star if he got an equal amount of screen time as Disney 's biggest star Mickey Mouse. Because of this both characters are always together in frame when onscreen. Roger Rabbit was also one of the final productions in which Mel Blanc voiced Bugs as well as the other Looney Tunes characters before his death in 1989. Bugs later appeared in another animated production featuring numerous characters from rival studios the 1990 drug prevention TV special Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue. This special is notable for being the first time that someone other than Blanc voiced Bugs and Daffy both characters were voiced by Jeff Bergman for this. Bugs also made guest appearances in the early 1990s television series Tiny Toon Adventures as the principal of Acme Looniversity and the mentor of Babs and Buster Bunny. He made further cameos in Warner Bros. subsequent animated TV shows Taz-Mania Animaniacs and Histeria. Bugs returned to the silver screen in Box-Office Bunny 1991. This was the first Bugs Bunny cartoon since 1964 to be released in theaters and it was created for Bugs 50th anniversary celebration. It was followed by Blooper Bunny cartoon that was shelved from theaters but later premiered on Cartoon Network in 1997 and has since gained cult following among animation fans for its edgy humor.In 1996 Bugs and the other Looney Tunes characters appeared in the live-action/animated film Space Jam directed by Joe Pytka and starring NBA superstar Michael Jordan. The film also introduced the character Lola Bunny who becomes Bugs new love interest. Space Jam received mixed reviews from critics but was box office success grossing over 230 million worldwide. The success of Space Jam led to the development of another live-action/animated film Looney Tunes Back in Action released in 2003 and directed by Joe Dante. Unlike Space Jam Back in Action was box-office bomb though it did receive more positive reviews from critics.In 1997 Bugs appeared on U.S. postage stamp the first cartoon to be so honored beating the iconic Mickey Mouse. The stamp is number seven on the list of the ten most popular U.S. stamps as calculated by the number of stamps purchased but not used. The introduction of Bugs onto stamp was controversial at the time as it was seen as step toward the 'commercialization of stamp art. The postal service rejected many designs and went with postal-themed drawing. Avery Dennison printed the Bugs Bunny stamp sheet which featured special ten-stamp design and was the first self-adhesive souvenir sheet issued by the U.S. Postal Service. More recent years younger version of Bugs is the main character of Baby Looney Tunes which debuted on Kids WB in 2001. In the action-comedy Loonatics Unleashed his definite descendant Ace Bunny is the leader of the Loonatics team and seems to have inherited his ancestor 's Brooklyn accent and rapier wit. In 2011 Bugs Bunny and the rest of the Looney Tunes gang returned to television in the Cartoon Network sitcom The Looney Tunes Show. The characters feature new designs by artist Jessica Borutski. Among the changes to Bugs appearance were the simplification and enlargement of his feet as well as change to his fur from gray to shade of mauve though in the second season his fur was changed back to gray. In the series Bugs and Daffy Duck are portrayed as best friends as opposed to their usual pairing as friendly rivals. At the same time Bugs is more vocally exasperated by Daffy 's antics in the series sometimes to the point of anger compared to his usual level-headed personality from the original cartoons. Bugs and Daffy are friends with Porky Pig in the series although Bugs tends to be better friend to Porky than Daffy is. Bugs also dates Lola Bunny in the show despite the fact that he finds her to be crazy and bit too talkative at first he later learns to accept her personality quirks similar to his tolerance for Daffy. Unlike the original cartoons Bugs lives in regular home which he shares with Daffy Taz whom he treats as pet dog and Speedy Gonzales in the middle of cul-de-sac with their neighbors Yosemite Sam Granny and Witch Hazel. In 2015 Bugs starred in the direct-to-video film Looney Tunes Rabbits Run and later returned to television yet again as the star of Cartoon Network and Boomerang 's comedy series New Looney Tunes formerly Wabbit .In 2020 Bugs began appearing on the HBO Max streaming series Looney Tunes Cartoons. His design for this series primarily resembles his Bob Clampett days complete with yellow gloves and his signature carrot. His personality is combination of Freleng 's trickery Clampett 's defiance and Jones resilience while also maintaining his confident insolent smooth-talking demeanor. Bugs is voiced by Eric Bauza who is also the current voice of Daffy Duck and Tweety among others. Bugs made his return to movie theaters in the 2021 Space Jam sequel Space Jam New Legacy this time starring NBA superstar LeBron James. In 2022 new pre-school animated series titled Bugs Bunny Builders aired on HBO Max and Cartoonito.Bugs has also appeared in numerous video games including the Bugs Bunny 's Crazy Castle series Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout Bugs Bunny Rabbit Rampage Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble Looney Tunes B-Ball Looney Tunes Racing Looney Tunes Space Race Bugs Bunny Lost in Time Bugs Bunny and Taz Time Busters Loons The Fight for Fame Looney Tunes Acme Arsenal Scooby Doo and Looney Tunes Cartoon Universe Looney Tunes Dash Looney Tunes World of Mayhem and MultiVersus. Personality and catchphrases Bugs Bunny is characterized as being clever and capable of outsmarting almost anyone who antagonizes him including Elmer Fudd Yosemite Sam Tasmanian Devil Marvin the Martian Wile E. Coyote Gossamer Witch Hazel Rocky and Mugsy The Crusher Beaky Buzzard Willoughby Count Bloodcount Daffy Duck and host of others. The only one to consistently beat Bugs is Cecil Turtle who defeats Bugs in three consecutive shorts based on the premise of the Aesop fable The Tortoise and the Hare. In rare villain turn Bugs turns to life of crime in 1949 's Rebel Rabbit taking on the entire United States government by vandalizing monuments in an effort to prove he is worth more than the two-cent bounty on his head while he succeeds in raising the bounty to 1,000,000 the full force of the military ends up capturing Bugs and sending him to Alcatraz. Bugs almost always wins these conflicts plot pattern which recurs in Looney Tunes films directed by Chuck Jones. Concerned that viewers would lose sympathy for an aggressive protagonist who always won Jones arranged for Bugs to be bullied cheated or threatened by the antagonists while minding his own business justifying his subsequent antics as retaliation or self-defense. He has also been known to break the fourth wall by communicating with the audience either by explaining the situation e.g. Be with you in minute folks. describing someone to the audience e.g. Feisty ai n't they. clueing in on the story e.g. That happens to him all during the picture folks. explaining that one of his antagonists actions have pushed him to the breaking point Of course you realize this means war. line borrowed from Groucho Marx in Duck Soup and used again in the next Marx Brothers film Night at the Opera 1935 admitting his own deviousness toward his antagonists Ai n't stinker. line borrowed from Lou Costello etc. This style was used and established by Tex Avery. Bugs usually tries to placate his antagonist and avoid conflict but when an antagonist pushes him too far Bugs may address the audience and invoke his catchphrase Of course you realize this means war. before he retaliates in devastating manner. As mentioned earlier this line was taken from Groucho Marx. Bugs paid homage to Groucho in other ways such as occasionally adopting his stooped walk or leering eyebrow-raising in Hair-Raising Hare for example or sometimes with direct impersonation as in Slick Hare. Other directors such as Friz Freleng characterized Bugs as altruistic. When Bugs meets other successful characters such as Cecil Turtle in Tortoise Beats Hare the Gremlin in Falling Hare and the unnamed mouse in Rhapsody Rabbit his overconfidence becomes disadvantage and sometimes even leads to his undoing. Bugs nonchalant carrot-chewing standing position as explained by Freleng Jones and Bob Clampett originated in scene from the film It Happened One Night 1934 in which Clark Gable 's character Peter Warne leans against fence eating carrots rapidly and talking with his mouth full to Claudette Colbert 's character. This scene was well known while the film was popular and viewers at the time likely recognized Bugs Bunny 's behavior as satire. Coincidentally the film also features minor character Oscar Shapely who addresses Peter Warne as Doc and Warne mentions an imaginary person named Bugs Dooley to frighten Shapely. The carrot-chewing scenes are generally followed by Bugs most well-known catchphrase What 's up Doc. which was written by director Tex Avery for his first Bugs Bunny film Wild Hare 1940. Avery explained later that it was common expression in his native Texas and that he did not think much of the phrase. Back then doc meant the same as dude does today. When the cartoon was first screened in theaters the What 's up Doc. scene generated tremendously positive audience reaction. As result the scene became recurring element in subsequent cartoons. The phrase was sometimes modified for situation. For example Bugs says What 's up dogs. to the antagonists in Hare Grows in Manhattan What 's up Duke. to the knight in Knight-mare Hare and What 's up prune-face. to the aged Elmer in The Old Grey Hare. He might also greet Daffy with What 's up Duck. He used one variation What 's all the hub-bub bub. only once in Falling Hare. Another variation is used in Looney Tunes Back in Action when he greets blaster-wielding Marvin the Martian saying What 's up Darth. Several Chuck Jones films in the late 1940s and 1950s depict Bugs travelling via cross-country and in some cases intercontinental tunnel-digging ending up in places as varied as Barcelona Spain Bully for Bugs the Himalayas The Abominable Snow Rabbit and Antarctica Frigid Hare all because he knew he shoulda taken that left toin at Albukoikee. He first utters that phrase in Herr Meets Hare 1945 when he emerges in the Black Forest cartoon seldom seen today due to its blatantly topical subject matter. When Hermann Göring says to Bugs There is no Las Vegas in 'Chermany and takes potshot at Bugs Bugs dives into his hole and says Joimany. Yipe. as Bugs realizes he is behind enemy lines. The confused response to his left toin comment also followed pattern. For example when he tunnels into Scotland in My Bunny Lies over the Sea 1948 while thinking he is heading for the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles California it provides another chance for an ethnic joke Therrre arrre no La Brrrea Tarrr Pits in Scotland. to which Bugs responds Scotland. Eh ... what 's up Mac-doc. couple of late-1950s/early-1960s cartoons of this ilk also featured Daffy Duck travelling with Bugs Hey wait minute. Since when is Pismo Beach inside cave. Voice actors The following are the various vocal artists who have voiced Bugs Bunny over the last 80-plus years for both Warner Bros. official productions and others Mel Blanc Mel Blanc voiced the character for almost 50 years from Bugs debut in the 1940 short Wild Hare until Blanc 's death in 1989. Blanc described the voice as combination of Bronx and Brooklyn accents however Tex Avery claimed that he asked Blanc to give the character not New York accent per se but voice like that of actor Frank McHugh who frequently appeared in supporting roles in the 1930s and whose voice might be described as New York Irish. In Bugs second cartoon Elmer 's Pet Rabbit Blanc created completely new voice for Bugs which sounded like Jimmy Stewart impression but the directors decided the previous voice was better. Though Blanc 's best known character was the carrot-chomping rabbit munching on the carrots interrupted the dialogue. Various substitutes such as celery were tried but none of them sounded like carrot. So for the sake of expedience Blanc munched and then spit the carrot bits into spittoon rather than swallowing them and continued with the dialogue. One often-repeated story which dates back to the 1940s is that Blanc was allergic to carrots and had to spit them out to minimize any allergic reaction but his autobiography makes no such claim. In fact in 1984 interview with Tim Lawson co-author of The Magic Behind The Voices Who 's Who of Voice Actors Blanc emphatically denied being allergic to carrots.

Reception and legacy Like Mickey Mouse for Disney Bugs Bunny has served as the mascot for Warner Bros. and its various divisions. According to Guinness World Records Bugs has appeared in more films both short and feature-length than any other cartoon character and is the ninth most portrayed film personality in the world. On December 10 1985 Bugs became the second cartoon character after Mickey to receive star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.He also has been pitchman for companies including Kool-Aid and Nike. His Nike commercials with Michael Jordan as Hare Jordan for the Air Jordan VII and VIII became precursors to Space Jam. As result he has spent time as an honorary member of Jordan Brand including having Jordan 's Jumpman logo done in his image. In 2015 as part of the 30th anniversary of Jordan Brand Nike released mid-top Bugs Bunny version of the Air Jordan named the Air Jordan Mid Hare along with women 's equivalent inspired by Lola Bunny called the Air Jordan Mid Lola along with commercial featuring Bugs and Ahmad Rashad.In 2002 TV Guide compiled list of the 50 greatest cartoon characters of all time as part of the magazine 's 50th anniversary. Bugs Bunny was given the honor of number. In CNN broadcast on July 31 2002 TV Guide editor talked about the group that created the list. The editor also explained why Bugs pulled top billing His stock ... has never gone down ... Bugs is the best example ... of the smart-aleck American comic. He not only is great cartoon character he 's great comedian. He was written well. He was drawn beautifully. He has thrilled and made many generations laugh. He is tops. Some have noted that comedian Eric Andre is the nearest contemporary comedic equivalent to Bugs. They attribute this to their ability to constantly flip the script on their unwitting counterparts.

Blood on the Risers,Blood on the Risers is an American paratrooper song from World War II. It is associated with all current American airborne units including the 82nd Airborne Division the 173rd Airborne Brigade and 4th Brigade Combat Team Airborne of the 25th Infantry Division and the 120th CTS United States as well as British airborne units. It is known as Mancha Roja Spanish for Red Stain in airborne units from multiple Latin American countries. In Spain it is called Sangre en las cuerdas Blood upon the risers in English. This song has been featured in the television miniseries Band of Brothers the television series Preacher and the video game Brothers in Arms Road to Hill 30. It was also mentioned in Donald Burgett 's book Currahee. Screaming Eagle at Normandy. Sung to the tune of The Battle Hymn of the Republic the song tells of fatal training jump of rookie paratrooper whose parachute fails to deploy resulting in him falling to his death. Each verse describes the man death and the subsequent condition of his body in the aftermath. The song is cautionary tale on the dangers of improper preparation of parachute jump. The protagonist does everything right but forgets to hook up his static line which would automatically deploy his main parachute. Upon discovering this error during the jump he deploys his reserve chute in bad falling position with disastrous results as he becomes entangled in the parachute canopy and risers and falls uncontrollably to the ground below. As the reserve chute is stored in belly bag on the World War II-era rig deploying it in bad falling position could easily lead to an accident not unlike the one described in the song. Risers are the four straps that connect the suspension lines of the parachute canopy to the parachute harness.,Blood on the Risers is an American paratrooper song from World War II.

Orchestral suites (Bach),The four orchestral suites BWV 1066–1069 called ouvertures by their composer are four suites by Johann Sebastian Bach from the years 1724-1731. The name ouverture refers only in part to the opening movement in the style of the French overture in which majestic opening section in relatively slow dotted-note rhythm in duple meter is followed by fast fugal section then rounded off with short recapitulation of the opening music. More broadly the term was used in Baroque Germany for suite of dance-pieces in French Baroque style preceded by such an ouverture. This genre was extremely popular in Germany during Bach 's day and he showed far less interest in it than was usual Robin Stowell writes that Telemann 's 135 surviving examples represent only fraction of those he is known to have written Christoph Graupner left 85 and Johann Friedrich Fasch left almost 100. Bach did write several other ouverture suites for solo instruments notably the Cello Suite no. BWV 1011 which also exists in the autograph Lute Suite in minor BWV 995 the Keyboard Partita no. in BWV 828 and the Overture in the French style BWV 831 for keyboard. The two keyboard works are among the few Bach published and he prepared the lute suite for Monsieur Schouster presumably for fee so all three may attest to the form 's popularity. Scholars believe that Bach did not conceive of the four orchestral suites as set in the way he conceived of the Brandenburg Concertos since the sources are various as detailed below. The Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis catalogue includes fifth suite BWV 1070 in minor. However this work is highly unlikely to have been composed by J. S.

Bach in the autograph part spells this Battinerie .Instrumentation Solo Flute traversière transverse flute violin I/II viola basso continuo. The Polonaise is stylization of the Polish folk song Wezmę ja kontusz 'll take my nobleman 's robe. The Badinerie literally jesting in French in other works Bach used the Italian word with the same meaning scherzo has become show-piece for solo flautists because of its quick pace and difficulty. For many years in the 1980s and early 1990s the movement was the incidental music for ITV Schools morning programmes in the UK. Earlier version in minor Joshua Rifkin has argued based on in-depth analysis of the partially autograph primary sources that this work is based on an earlier version in minor in which the solo flute part was scored instead for solo violin. Rifkin demonstrates that notational errors in the surviving parts can best be explained by their having been copied from model whole tone lower and that this solo part would venture below the lowest pitches on the flutes Bach wrote for the transverse flute which Bach called flauto traverso or flute traversière. Rifkin argues that the violin was the most likely option noting that in writing the word Traversiere in the solo part Bach seems to have fashioned the letter out of an earlier suggesting that he originally intended to write the word violin the page in question can be viewed here p. Further Rifkin notes passages that would have used the violinistic technique of bariolage. Rifkin also suggests that Bach was inspired to write the suite by similar work by his second cousin Johann Bernhard Bach. Flautist Steven Zohn accepts the argument of an earlier version in minor but suggests that the original part may have been playable on flute as well as violin.Oboist Gonzalo X. Ruiz has argued in detail that the solo instrument in the lost original minor version was the oboe and he has recorded it in his own reconstruction of that putative original on baroque oboe. His case against the violin is that the range is curiously limited for that instrument avoiding the string almost entirely and that the supposed violin solo would at times be lower in pitch than the first violin part something that is almost unheard of in dedicated violin concertos. By contrast the range is exactly the range of Bach 's oboes scoring the solo oboe occasionally lower than the first violin was typical Baroque practice as the oboe still comes through to the ear and the figurations are very similar to those found in many oboe works of the period. Suite No. in major BWV 1068 The oldest source is partially autographed set of parts from around 1730. Bach wrote out the first violin and continuo parts C. P. E. Bach wrote out the trumpet oboe and timpani parts and J. S. Bach 's student Johann Ludwig Krebs wrote out the second violin and viola parts.

Suite No. in major BWV 1069 The source is lost but the existing parts date from circa 1730. Rifkin has argued that the lost original version was written during Bach 's tenure at Köthen did not have trumpets or timpani and that Bach first added these parts when adapting the Ouverture movement for the choral first movement to his 1725 Christmas cantata Unser Mund sei voll Lachens BWV 110 Our mouths be full of laughter.

History Iași has long tradition in higher education the first institute that functioned on the territory of Romania was Academia Vasiliană founded in 1640 by the Moldavian Prince Vasile Lupu followed in 1707 by Princely Academy of Iași. The Princely Academy renamed in 1812 The Academy of Filology and Science matched up to the standards of the other European Academies of the time and the Romanian language gained importance over the Greek language. The foundation in 1835 of the Academia Mihăileană is considered landmark in the history of Romanian higher education. The Academia Mihăileană was created under the auspices of Prince Mihail Sturdza hence its name striving for progress and for meeting the standards of the enlightened Europe. Three faculties were set up the Faculty of Law the Faculty of Philosophy and the Faculty of Theology and the curriculum resembled to great extent that of Austrian and German academies. After the Unification of the Romanian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia by the Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza the inauguration at 26 October 1860 of the University of Iași the first Romanian modern university was to be stepping stone to modern higher education in Romania.By 1879 the University of Iași had four faculties Law Letters and Philosophy Sciences and Medicine. In 1892 the Faculty of Sciences added the Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry followed by the Department of Agricultural Chemistry in 1906 and the School of the Industrial Electricity in 1910. In March 1937 the technical higher education departments and the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences were transferred to the newly established Gheorghe Asachi Polytechnic School and in 1948 the Medical School became the independent Institute of Medicine and Pharmacy of Iași.

Grounds The university grounds lie on Copou Hill in the northern part of the city. The main university building known as the University Palace was erected between 1893 and 1897 and extended in 1933–1937 on the site of the first Iași National Theatre which had burned down in 1888. The Hall of the university known as The Hall of the Lost Footsteps served as parliamentary debating chamber between 1917 and 1918 when during the Great War Iași was the capital of Romania. In 1968–1978 the painter Sabin Bălaşa created series of strongly romanticized frescoes for the arcades. The University Palace is shared with the Gheorghe Asachi Technical University.

Secession in the United States,In the context of the United States secession primarily refers to the voluntary withdrawal of one or more states from the Union that constitutes the United States but may loosely refer to leaving state or territory to form separate territory or new state or to the severing of an area from city or county within state. Advocates for secession are called disunionists by their contemporaries in various historical documents. Threats and aspirations to secede from the United States or arguments justifying secession have been feature of the country 's politics almost since its birth. Some have argued for secession as constitutional right and others as from natural right of revolution. In Texas v. White 1869 the Supreme Court ruled unilateral secession unconstitutional while commenting that revolution or consent of the states could lead to successful secession. The most serious attempt at secession was advanced in the years 1860 and 1861 as 11 Southern states each declared secession from the United States and joined together to form the Confederate States of America procedure and body that the government of the United States refused to accept. The movement collapsed in 1865 with the defeat of Confederate forces by Union armies in the American Civil War.In the history of the United States the only territories to have been withdrawn from the country are the small portions of the Louisiana Purchase north of the 49th parallel north established as the U.S.–British now Canadian border by the Treaty of 1818 and the territory of the Commonwealth of the Philippines which became independent after the Treaty of Manila. The former is today part of Canada while the latter corresponds to the Republic of the Philippines. Boundaries of U.S. territories such as the Nebraska Territory were not defined precisely. The boundaries of each new state are set in the document admitting the former territory to the Union as state which Congress must approve. There is only one instance in U.S. history in which portion of state successfully seceded to create new state West Virginia which separated from Virginia in 1863.,"In the context of the United States secession primarily refers to the voluntary withdrawal of one or more states from the Union that constitutes the United States but may loosely refer to leaving state or territory to form separate territory or new state or to the severing of an area from city or county within state.

The American Revolution secession from Great Britain The Declaration of Independence states We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights that among these are Life Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.—That to secure these rights Governments are instituted among Men deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed —That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it and to institute new Government laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Historian Pauline Maier argues that this narrative asserted the right of revolution which was after all the right Americans were exercising in 1776 and notes that Thomas Jefferson 's language incorporated ideas explained at length by long list of 17th-century writers including John Milton Algernon Sidney John Locke and other English and Scottish commentators all of whom had contributed to the development of the Whig tradition in 18th-century Britain.The right of revolution expressed in the Declaration was immediately followed with the observation that long-practiced injustice is tolerated until sustained assaults on the rights of the entire people have accumulated enough force to oppress them then they may defend themselves. This reasoning was not original to the Declaration but can be found in many prior political writings Locke 's Two Treatises of Government 1690 the Fairfax Resolves of 1774 Jefferson 's own Summary View of the Rights of British America the first Constitution of Virginia which was enacted five days prior to the Declaration and Thomas Paine 's Common Sense 1776 Prudence indeed will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ... mankind are more disposed to suffer while Evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the Forms of Government editor 's addition to which they are accustomed. But when long train of abuses and usurpations pursuing ... design to reduce them under absolute Despotism it is their right it is their duty to throw off such Government and to provide new Guards for their future security. Gordon S. Wood quotes President John Adams Only repeated multiplied oppressions placing it beyond all doubt that their rulers had formed settled plans to deprive them of their liberties could warrant the concerted resistance of the people against their government. Pre-Civil War political and legal views on secession Overview With origins in the question of states rights the issue of secession was argued in many forums and advocated from time to time in both the North and South in the decades after adopting the Constitution and before the American Civil War. Historian Maury Klein described the contemporary debate Was the Republic unified nation in which the individual states had merged their sovereign rights and identities forever or was it federation of sovereign states joined together for specific purposes from which they could withdraw at any time. He observed that the case can be made that no result of the American Civil war was more important than the destruction once and for all ... of the idea of secession .Historian Forrest McDonald argued that after adopting the Constitution there were no guidelines either in theory or in history as to whether the compact could be dissolved and if so on what conditions. However during the founding era many public figure ... declared that the states could interpose their powers between their citizens and the power of the federal government and talk of secession was not unknown. But according to McDonald to avoid resorting to the violence that had accompanied the Revolution the Constitution established legitimate means for constitutional change in the future. In effect the Constitution completed and perfected the Revolution .Whatever the intentions of the Founders threats of secession and disunion were constant in the political discourse of Americans preceding the Civil War. Historian Elizabeth R. Varon wrote ne word disunion contained and stimulated their Americans fears of extreme political factionalism tyranny regionalism economic decline foreign intervention class conflict gender disorder racial strife widespread violence and anarchy and civil war all of which could be interpreted as God 's retribution for America 's moral failings. Disunion connoted the dissolution of the republic—the failure of the Founders efforts to establish stable and lasting representative government. For many Americans in the North and the South disunion was nightmare tragic cataclysm that would reduce them to the kind of fear and misery that seemed to pervade the rest of the world. And yet for many other Americans disunion served as the main instrument by which they could achieve their political goals. Abandoning the Articles of Confederation In late 1777 the Second Continental Congress approved the Articles of Confederation for ratification by the individual states. The Confederation government was administered de facto by the Congress under the provisions of the approved final draft of the Articles until they achieved ratification—and de jure status—in early 1781. In 1786 delegates of five states the Annapolis Convention called for convention of delegates in Philadelphia to amend the Articles which would require the unanimous consent of all thirteen states. The delegates to the Philadelphia Convention convened and deliberated from May to September 1787. Instead of pursuing their official charge they returned draft new Constitution proposed for constructing and administering new federal—later also known as national —government. They further proposed that the draft Constitution not be submitted to the Congress where it would require unanimous approval of the states instead that it be presented directly to the states for ratification in special ratification conventions and that approval by minimum of nine state conventions would suffice to adopt the new Constitution and initiate the new federal government and that only those states ratifying the Constitution would be included in the new government. For time eleven of the original states operated under the Constitution without two non-ratifying states Rhode Island and North Carolina. In effect the delegates proposed to abandon and replace the Articles of Confederation rather than amend them.Because the Articles had specified perpetual union various arguments have been offered to explain the apparent contradiction and presumed illegality of abandoning one form of government and creating another that did not include the members of the original. One explanation was that the Articles of Confederation simply failed to protect the vital interests of the individual states. Necessity then rather than legality was the practical factor in abandoning the Articles.According to historian John Ferling by 1786 the Union under the Articles was falling apart. James Madison of Virginia and Alexander Hamilton of New York—they who joined together to vigorously promote new Constitution—urged that renewed stability of the Union government was critically needed to protect property and commerce. Both founders were strong advocates for more powerful central government they published The Federalist Papers to advocate their cause and became known as the federalists. Because of his powerful advocacy Madison was later accorded the honorific Father of the Constitution. Ferling wrote Rumors of likely secessionist movements were unleashed. There was buzz as well that some states planned to abandon the American Union and form regional confederacy. America it was said would go the way of Europe and ultimately three or four or more confederacies would spring up. ... Not only would these confederations be capable of taking steps that were beyond the ability of Congress under the articles but in private some portrayed such step in positive light in as much as the regional union could adopt constitutions that secured property rights and maintained order. Other arguments that justified abandoning the Articles of Confederation pictured the Articles as an international compact between unconsolidated sovereign states any one of which was empowered to renounce the compact at will. This as opposed to consolidated union that totally annihilated without any power of revival the sovereign states. The Articles required that all states were obliged to comply with all requirements of the agreement thus permanence was linked to compliance. 'Compliance was typically perceived as matter of interpretation by each individual state. Emerich de Vattel recognized authority on international law wrote at the time that Treaties contain promises that are perfect and reciprocal. If one of the allies fails in his engagements the other may ... disengage himself in his promises and ... break the treaty. Thus each state could unilaterally 'secede from the Articles of Confederation at will this argument for abandoning the Articles—for its weakness in the face of secession—was used by advocates for the new Constitution and was featured by James Madison in Federalist No. 43.St. George Tucker an influential jurist in the early republic era and especially in the South argued that abandoning the Articles of Confederation was the same as seceding from the Articles government. In 1803 he wrote that the unanimous dissolution of the Articles Confederation in 1789 by Act of Congress was legal precedent for future secession from the Constitution one state at time by state legislatures. And since the seceding states by establishing new constitution and form of federal government among themselves without the consent of the rest have shown that they consider the right to do so whenever the occasion may in their opinion require it we may infer that the right has not been diminished by any new compact which they may since have entered into since none could be more solemn or explicit than the first nor more binding upon the contracting partie. Others such as Chief Justice John Marshall who had been Virginia delegate to its Ratification Federal Convention denied that ratifying the Constitution was precedent for future one-off dissolution of the Union by an isolated state or states. Writing in 1824 exactly midway between the fall of the Articles of Confederation and the rise of second self-described American Confederacy Marshal summarized the issue thusly Reference has been made to the political situation of these states anterior to the Constitution 's formation. It has been said that they were sovereign were completely independent and were connected with each other only by league. This is true. But when these allied sovereigns converted their league into government when they converted their congress of ambassadors deputed to deliberate on their common concerns and to recommend measures of general utility into legislature empowered to enact laws on the most interesting subjects the whole character in which the states appear underwent change. Nationalists for Union in the antebellum America argued the opposite of secession that indeed the new Constitution inherited perpetuity from the language in the Articles and from other actions done prior to the Constitution. Historian Kenneth Stampp explains their view Lacking an explicit clause in the Constitution with which to establish the Union 's perpetuity the nationalists made their case first with unique interpretation of the history of the country prior to the Philadelphia Convention second with inferences drawn from certain passages of the Constitution and third with careful selections from the speeches and writings of the Founding Fathers. The historical case begins with the postulate that the Union is older than the states. It quotes the reference in the Declaration of Independence to these united colonies contends that the Second Continental Congress actually called the states into being i.e. colonies no longer notes the provision for perpetual Union in the Articles of Confederation and ends with the reminder that the preamble to the new Constitution gives as one of its purposes the formation of more perfect Union. Adopting the Constitution Constitutional scholar Akhil Reed Amar argues that the permanence of the Union of the states changed significantly when the U.S. Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation. This action signaled its decisive break with the Articles regime of state sovereignty. By adopting constitution—rather than treaty or compact or an instrument of confederacy etc.—that created new body of government designed to be senior to the several states and by approving the particular language and provisions of that new Constitution the framers and voters made it clear that the fates of the individual states were severely changed and that the new United States was Not league however firm not confederacy or confederation not compact on among sovereign states —all these high profile and legally freighted words from the Articles were conspicuously absent from the Preamble and every other operative part of the Constitution. The new text proposed fundamentally different legal framework. Patrick Henry adamantly opposed adopting the Constitution because he interpreted its language to replace the sovereignty of the individual states including that of his own Virginia. He gave his strong voice to the anti-federalist cause in opposition to the federalists led by Madison and Hamilton. Questioning the nature of the proposed new federal government Henry asked The fate ... of America may depend on this. ... Have they made proposal of compact between the states. If they had this would be confederation. It is otherwise most clearly consolidated government. The question turns sir on that poor little thing—the expression We the people instead of the states of America. .... The federalists acknowledged that national sovereignty would be transferred by the new Constitution to the whole of the American people—indeed regard the expression We the people .... They argued however that Henry exaggerated the extent to which consolidated government was being created and that the states would serve vital role within the new republic even though their national sovereignty was ending. Tellingly on the matter of whether states retained right to unilaterally secede from the United States the federalists made it clear that no such right would exist under the Constitution.Amar specifically cites the example of New York 's ratification as suggestive that the Constitution did not countenance secession. Anti-federalists dominated the Poughkeepsie Convention that would ratify the Constitution. Concerned that the new compact might not sufficiently safeguard states rights the anti-federalists sought to insert into the New York ratification message language to the effect that there should be reserved to the state of New York right to withdraw herself from the union after certain number of years. The Madison federalists opposed this with Hamilton delegate at the Convention reading aloud in response letter from James Madison stating the Constitution requires an adoption in toto and for ever emphasis added. Hamilton and John Jay then told the Convention that in their view reserving right to withdraw was inconsistent with the Constitution and was no ratification. The New York convention ultimately ratified the Constitution without including the right to withdraw language proposed by the anti-federalists. Amar explains how the Constitution impacted on state sovereignty In dramatic contrast to Article VII–whose unanimity rule that no state can bind another confirms the sovereignty of each state prior to 1787 Article does not permit single state convention to modify the federal Constitution for itself. Moreover it makes clear that state may be bound by federal constitutional amendment even if that state votes against the amendment in properly convened state convention. And this rule is flatly inconsistent with the idea that states remain sovereign after joining the Constitution even if they were sovereign before joining it. Thus ratification of the Constitution itself marked the moment when previously sovereign states gave up their sovereignty and legal independence. Natural right of revolution versus right of secession Debates on the legality of secession often looked back to the example of the American Revolution and the Declaration of Independence. Law professor Daniel Farber defined what he considered the borders of this debate What about the original understanding. The debates contain scattered statements about the permanence or impermanence of the Union. The occasional references to the impermanency of the Constitution are hard to interpret. They might have referred to legal right to revoke ratification. But they equally could have referred to an extraconstitutional right of revolution or to the possibility that new national convention would rewrite the Constitution or simply to the factual possibility that the national government might break down. Similarly references to the permanency of the Union could have referred to the practical unlikelihood of withdrawal rather than any lack of legal power. The public debates seemingly do not speak specifically to whether ratification under Article VII was revocable. In the public debate over the Nullification Crisis the separate issue of secession was also discussed. James Madison often referred to as The Father of the Constitution strongly opposed the argument that secession was permitted by the Constitution. In March 15 1833 letter to Daniel Webster congratulating him on speech opposing nullification Madison discussed revolution versus secession return my thanks for the copy of your late very powerful Speech in the Senate of the United S. It crushes nullification and must hasten the abandonment of Secession. But this dodges the blow by confounding the claim to secede at will with the right of seceding from intolerable oppression. The former answers itself being violation without cause of faith solemnly pledged. The latter is another name only for revolution about which there is no theoretic controversy. Thus Madison affirms an extraconstitutional right to revolt against conditions of intolerable oppression but if the case can not be made that such conditions exist then he rejects secession—as violation of the Constitution. During the crisis President Andrew Jackson published his Proclamation to the People of South Carolina which made case for the perpetuity of the Union plus he provided his views re the questions of revolution and secession But each State having expressly parted with so many powers as to constitute jointly with the other States single nation can not from that period possess any right to secede because such secession does not break league but destroys the unity of nation and any injury to that unity is not only breach which would result from the contravention of compact but it is an offense against the whole Union. emphasis added To say that any State may at pleasure secede from the Union is to say that the United States are not nation because it would be solecism to contend that any part of nation might dissolve its connection with the other parts to their injury or ruin without committing any offense. Secession like any other revolutionary act may be morally justified by the extremity of oppression but to call it constitutional right is confounding the meaning of terms and can only be done through gross error or to deceive those who are willing to assert right but would pause before they made revolution or incur the penalties consequent upon failure. Some twenty-eight years after Jackson spoke President James Buchanan gave different voice—one much more accommodating to the views of the secessionists and the slave states—in the midst of the pre-War secession crisis. In his final State of the Union address to Congress on December 1860 he stated his view that the South after having first used all peaceful and constitutional means to obtain redress would be justified in revolutionary resistance to the Government of the Union but he also drew his apocalyptic vision of the results to be expected from secession In order to justify secession as constitutional remedy it must be on the principle that the Federal Government is mere voluntary association of States to be dissolved at pleasure by any one of the contracting parties. If this be so the Confederacy here referring to the existing Union is rope of sand to be penetrated and dissolved by the first adverse wave of public opinion in any of the States. In this manner our thirty-three States may resolve themselves into as many petty jarring and hostile republics each one retiring from the Union without responsibility whenever any sudden excitement might impel them to such course. By this process Union might be entirely broken into fragments in few weeks which cost our forefathers many years of toil privation and blood to establish. Alien and Sedition Acts In response to the 1798 Alien and Sedition Acts—advanced by the Federalist Party—John Taylor of the Virginia House of Delegates spoke out urging Virginia to secede from the United States. He argued—as one of many vociferous responses by the Jeffersonian Republicans—the sense of the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions adopted in 1798 and 1799 which reserved to those States the rights of secession and interposition nullification .Thomas Jefferson while sitting as Vice President of the United States in 1799 wrote to James Madison of his conviction in reservation of th ose rights resulting to us from these palpable violations the Alien and Sedition Acts and if the federal government did not return to the true principles of our federal compact he was determined to sever ourselves from that union we so much value rather than give up the rights of self government which we have reserved and in which alone we see liberty safety and happiness. emphasis added Here Jefferson is arguing in radical voice and in private letter that he would lead movement for secession but it is unclear whether he is arguing for secession at will or for revolution on account of intolerable oppression see above or neither. Jefferson secretly wrote one of the Kentucky Resolutions which was done—again—while he was holding the office of Vice President. His biographer Dumas Malone argued that had his actions become known at the time Jefferson 's participation might have gotten him impeached for charged with treason. In writing the first Kentucky Resolution Jefferson warned that unless arrested at the threshold the Alien and Sedition Acts would necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood. Historian Ron Chernow says of this he was n't calling for peaceful protests or civil disobedience he was calling for outright rebellion if needed against the federal government of which he was vice president. Jefferson thus set forth radical doctrine of states rights that effectively undermined the constitution .Jeffersonian Republicans were not alone in claiming reserved rights against the federal government. Contributing to the rancorous debates during the War of 1812 Founding Father Gouverneur Morris of Pennsylvania and New York—a Federalist Hamilton ally and primary author of the Constitution who advanced the concept that Americans were citizens of single Union of the states—was persuaded to claim that secession under certain circumstances was entirely constitutional. New England Federalists and the Hartford Convention The election of 1800 showed Jefferson 's Democratic-Republican Party to be on the rise and the Federalists to be declining and the Federalists felt threatened by initiatives taken by their opponents. They viewed Jefferson 's unilateral purchase of the Louisiana territory as violating foundational agreements between the original 13 states Jefferson transacted the purchase in secret and refused to seek the approval of Congress. The new lands anticipated several future western states which the Federalists feared would be dominated by the Democratic-Republicans. Other things added to the Federalists alarm such as the impeachment of Federalist district judge John Pickering by the Jeffersonian-dominated Congress and similar attacks on Pennsylvania state officials by the Democratic-Republican legislature. By 1804 their national leadership was decimated and their viable base was reduced to the states of Massachusetts Connecticut and Delaware.Timothy Pickering of Massachusetts and few Federalists envisioned creating separate New England confederation possibly combining with lower Canada to form new pro-British nation. The Embargo Act of 1807 was seen as threat to the economy of Massachusetts and the state legislature debated in May 1808 how the state should respond. These debates generated isolated references to secession but no definite plot materialized. Historian Richard Buell Jr. suggests that the secessionist movement of 1804 was more of confession of despair about the future than realistic proposal for action. Federalist party members convened the Hartford Convention on December 15 1814 and they addressed their opposition to the continuing war with Britain and the domination of the federal government by the Virginia dynasty. Twenty six delegates attended Massachusetts sent 12 Connecticut seven and Rhode Island four. New Hampshire and Vermont declined but two counties each from those states sent delegates. Historian Donald R. Hickey notes Despite pleas in the New England press for secession and separate peace most of the delegates taking part in the Hartford Convention were determined to pursue moderate course. Only Timothy Bigelow of Massachusetts apparently favored extreme measures and he did not play major role in the proceedings. The final report addressed issues related to the war and state defense and it recommended several amendments to the Constitution. Massachusetts and Connecticut endorsed it but the war ended as the delegates were returning to Washington effectively quashing any impact that it might have had. The Jeffersonians described the convention as synonym for disloyalty and treason and it became major factor in the sharp decline of the Federalist Party. Abolitionists for secession by the North It is not often remembered today as it was the South that actually attempted to secede. However there was movement to have the North secede thereby escaping the slave power that dominated the Federal government. Tensions began to rise between North and South by the late 1830s over slavery and related issues. Many Northerners especially New Englanders saw themselves as political victims of conspiracies between slave owners and Western expansionists. They viewed the movements to annex Texas and to make war on Mexico as fomented by slaveholders bent on dominating Western expansion and thereby the national destiny. New England abolitionist Benjamin Lundy argued that the annexation of Texas was long-premeditated crusade—set on foot by slaveholders land speculators etc. with the view of reestablishing extending and perpetuating the system of slavery and the slave trade .The first petition asking for dissolution of the Union from the citizens of Haverhill Massachusetts was presented to the U.S. Congress by Massachusetts representative John Quincy Adams in January 1842.Newspaper editors began demanding separation from the South. William Lloyd Garrison called for secession in The Liberator of May 1844 with his Address to the Friends of Freedom and Emancipation in the United States. The Constitution was created he wrote at the expense of the colored population of the country and Southerners were dominating the nation because of the Three-fifths Compromise now it was time to set the captive free by the potency of truth and to secede from the government. Coincidentally the New England Anti-Slavery Convention endorsed the principles of disunion by vote of 250–24.In 1846 the following volume by Henry Clarke Wright was published in London The dissolution of the American union demanded by justice and humanity as the incurable enemy of liberty. The Southern members of Congress walked out in the 1830s in protest over support for slaves right to petition and were with difficulty persuaded to return. The enslaved did not have the right to petition the government. Support of secession really began to shift to Southern states from 1846 after introduction into the public debate of the Wilmot Proviso which would have prohibited slavery in the new territories acquired from Mexico. Southern leaders increasingly felt helpless against powerful political group that was attacking their interests slavery reminiscent of Federalist alarms at the beginning of the century. The Nashville Convention of 1850 The Nashville Convention was political meeting held in Nashville Tennessee on June 3–11 1850. Delegates from nine slave states met to consider secession if the United States Congress decided to ban slavery in the new territories being added to the country as result of the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican Cession. The compromises worked out in Nashville paved the way for the Compromise of 1850 including the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and for time preserved the union of the United States. In 1851 Frederick Barnard found that for the South the Union was the only security for Southern rights slavery. Northern No Union with Slaveholders conventions of 1856–57 Called by David Garrison convention to discuss the dissolution of the American Union and the formation of Northern non-slave-holding Confederacy was held in Worcester Massachusetts in January 1857.Similar conventions were held in Angola Indiana Adrian Michigan and Oswego New York at the latter of which Susan B. Anthony spoke. South Carolina 's secession During the presidential term of Andrew Jackson South Carolina had its own semi-secession movement due to the so-called 1828 Tariff of Abominations which threatened South Carolina 's economy and South Carolina in turn threatened to secede from the United States the Union. Jackson also threatened to send federal troops to put down the movement and to hang the leader of the secessionists from the highest tree in South Carolina. Also due to this Jackson 's vice president John C. Calhoun who supported the movement and wrote the essay The South Carolina Exposition and Protest became the first US vice president to resign. On May 1833 Jackson wrote of nullification the tariff was only pretext and disunion and Southern confederacy the real object. The next pretext will be the negro or slavery question. South Carolina also threatened to secede in 1850 over the issue of California 's statehood. It became the first state to declare its secession from the Union on December 20 1860 with the Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina from the Federal Union and it later joined with the other Southern states to form the Confederacy. Seceded states form the Confederate States of America See main articles Origins of the American Civil War Confederate States of America and American Civil War.The most famous secession movement was the case of the Southern states of the United States. Secession from the United States was accepted in eleven states and failed in two others. The seceding states joined together to form the Confederate States of America CSA. The eleven states of the CSA in order of their secession dates listed in parentheses were South Carolina December 20 1860 Mississippi January 1861 Florida January 10 1861 Alabama January 11 1861 Georgia January 19 1861 Louisiana January 26 1861 Texas February 1861 Virginia April 17 1861 Arkansas May 1861 North Carolina May 20 1861 and Tennessee June 1861. Secession was also declared by pro-Confederate governments in Missouri and Kentucky see Confederate government of Missouri and Confederate government of Kentucky but it never became effective as it was opposed by pro-Union governments that in both states retained actual control of the territory. In Virginia Unionists in the northwestern part of the state quickly succeeded in forming functioning government in Wheeling that opposed the pro-Confederate government in Virginia. By 1863 Unionists convinced Congress to admit fifty Virginia counties as the State of West Virginia and the Restored Government of Virginia relocated to Union-occupied Alexandria until the Confederacy 's dissolution. This secession movement brought about the American Civil War. The position of the Union was that the Confederacy was not sovereign nation—and never had been but that the Union was always single nation by intent of the states themselves from 1776 onward—and thus that rebellion had been initiated by individuals. Historian Bruce Catton described President Abraham Lincoln 's April 15 1861 proclamation after the attack on Fort Sumter which defined the Union 's position on the hostilities After reciting the obvious fact that combinations too powerful to be suppressed by ordinary law courts and marshalls had taken charge of affairs in the seven secessionist states it announced that the several states of the Union were called on to contribute 75,000 militia ... to suppress said combinations and to cause the laws to be duly executed. ... And hereby command the persons composing the combinations aforesaid to disperse and retire peacefully to their respective abodes within twenty days from this date. Political effects of their secession With the departure of the Representatives and Senators from the seceding states—most voluntarily but some were expelled—the makeup and organization of the 36th United States Congress changed dramatically. Vice-President and Senate President John C. Breckinridge of Kentucky remained until he was replaced by Hannibal Hamlin and then expelled but gone was the President pro tempore Benjamin Fitzpatrick of Alabama and the heads of the Senate committees on Claims Alfred Iverson Sr. of Georgia Commerce Clement Claiborne Clay of Alabama the District of Columbia Albert G. Brown of Mississippi Finance Robert M. T. Hunter of Virginia expelled Foreign Relations James M. Mason of Virginia expelled Military Affairs Jefferson Davis of Mississippi Naval Affairs Stephen Mallory of Florida and Public Lands Robert Ward Johnson of Arkansas. Within days Kansas was admitted to the Union as free state an issue at the time similar to the 20th and 21st-century debate over statehood for the District of Columbia. Within month Colorado Nevada and Dakota Territory followed. The end of slavery in the District of Columbia had been goal of abolitionists since the slavery gag rule crisis of the 1830s. The District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act passed in 1862 as did the Homestead Act and the Morrill Land-Grant Act of 1862 other measures the slave states had blocked. Disputed legality of unilateral secession The Constitution does not directly mention secession. The legality of secession was hotly debated in the 19th century. Although the Federalist Party briefly explored New England secession during the War of 1812 secession became associated with Southern states as the North 's industrial power increased. The Supreme Court has consistently interpreted the Constitution to be an indestructible union. The Articles of Confederation explicitly state the Union is perpetual the U.S. Constitution declares its purpose is to form more perfect union than the Articles of Confederation. Other scholars while not necessarily disagreeing that the secession was illegal point out that sovereignty is often de facto an extralegal question. Had the Confederacy won any illegality of its actions under U.S. law would have been rendered irrelevant just as the undisputed illegality of American rebellion under the British law of 1775 was rendered irrelevant. Thus these scholars argue the illegality of unilateral secession was not firmly de facto established until the Union won the Civil War in this view the legal question was resolved at Appomattox. Supreme Court rulings Texas v. White was argued before the United States Supreme Court during the December 1868 term. Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase read the Court 's decision on April 15 1869. Australian Professors Peter Radan and Aleksandar Pavkovic write Chase Chief Justice ruled in favor of Texas on the ground that the Confederate state government in Texas had no legal existence on the basis that the secession of Texas from the United States was illegal. The critical finding underpinning the ruling that Texas could not secede from the United States was that following its admission to the United States in 1845 Texas had become part of an indestructible Union composed of indestructible States ..... In practical terms this meant that Texas had never seceded from the United States. Chase however recognized that state could cease to be part of the union 'through revolution or through consent of the States .In 1877 the Williams v. Bruffy decision was rendered pertaining to Civil War debts. The Court wrote regarding acts establishing an independent government that The validity of its acts both against the parent state and the citizens or subjects thereof depends entirely upon its ultimate success if it fail to establish itself permanently all such acts perish with it if it succeed and become recognized its acts from the commencement of its existence are upheld as those of an independent nation. The Union as sovereign state Historian Kenneth Stampp notes that historical argument against secession was that the Union is older than the states and that the provision for perpetual Union in the Articles of Confederation was carried over into the Constitution by the reminder that the preamble to the new Constitution gives us one of its purposes the formation of more perfect Union. Concerning the White decision Stampp wrote In 1869 when the Supreme Court in Texas v. White finally rejected as untenable the case for constitutional right of secession it stressed this historical argument. The Union the Court said never was purely artificial and arbitrary relation. Rather It began among the Colonies ..... It was confirmed and strengthened by the necessities of war and received definite form and character and sanction from the Articles of Confederation. Texas secession from Mexico The Republic of Texas successfully seceded from Mexico in 1836 this however took the form of outright rebellion against Mexico and claimed no warrant under the Mexican Constitution to do so. Mexico refused to recognize its revolted province as an independent country and the Texas Republic did not have significant international recognition. In 1845 Congress admitted Texas as state. The documents governing Texas 's accession to the United States of America do not mention any right of secession—although they did raise the possibility of dividing Texas into multiple states inside the Union. Mexico warned that annexation meant war and the Mexican–American War followed in 1846. Partition of state Article IV Section. Clause of the United States Constitutions provides New States may be admitted by the Congress into this Union but no new States shall be formed or erected within the Jurisdiction of any other State nor any State be formed by the Junction of two or more States or parts of States without the Consent of the Legislatures of the States concerned as well as of the Congress. The separation referred to is not secession but partition. Some of the movements to partition states have identified themselves as secessionist movements. Of the new states admitted to the Union by Congress three were set off from already existing states while one was established upon land claimed by an existing state after existing for several years as de facto independent republic. They are Vermont was admitted as new state in 1791 after the legislature of New York ceded its claim to the region in 1790. New York 's claim that Vermont also known as the New Hampshire Grants was legally part of New York was and remains matter of disagreement. King George III ruled in 1764 that the region belonged to the Province of New York. Kentucky was part of Virginia until it was admitted as new state in 1792 with the consent of the legislature of Virginia in 1789. Maine was part of Massachusetts until it was admitted as new state in 1820 after the legislature of Massachusetts consented in 1819. West Virginia was part of Virginia until it was admitted as new state in 1863 after the General Assembly of the Restored Government of Virginia consented in 1862. The question of whether the legislature of Virginia consented is controversial as Virginia was one of the Confederate states. However antisecessionist Virginians formed government in exile which was recognized by the United States and approved the state 's partition. Later by its ruling in Virginia v. West Virginia 1871 the Supreme Court implicitly affirmed that the breakaway Virginia counties did have the proper consents required to become separate state. Many unsuccessful proposals to partition U.S. states have been drawn. 1980s–present efforts The late 20th and early 21st centuries have seen examples of local and state secession movements. All such movements to create new states have failed. The formation in 1971 of the Libertarian Party and its national platform affirmed the right of states to secede on three vital principles We shall support recognition of the right to secede. Political units or areas which do secede should be recognized by the United States as independent political entities where secession is supported by majority within the political unit the majority does not attempt suppression of the dissenting minority and the government of the new entity is at least as compatible with human freedom as that from which it seceded. City secession There was an attempt by Staten Island to break away from New York City in the late 1980s and early 1990s leading to 1993 referendum in which 65 voted to secede. Implementation was blocked in the State Assembly by assertions that the state 's constitution required home rule message from New York City.The San Fernando Valley lost vote to separate from Los Angeles in 2002. Despite the majority 55 of the valley within the L.A. city limits voting for secession the city council unanimously voted to block the partition of the valley north of Mulholland Drive. Other attempted city secession drives include Killington Vermont which has voted twice 2005 and 2006 to join New Hampshire the community of Miller Beach Indiana originally separate incorporated community to split from the city of Gary in 2007 and Northeast Philadelphia to split from the city of Philadelphia in the 1980s. portion of the town of Calabash North Carolina voted to secede from the town in 1998 after receiving permission for referendum on the issue from the state of North Carolina. Following secession the area incorporated itself as the town of Carolina Shores. Despite the split the towns continue to share fire and emergency services.The town of Rough and Ready California declared its secession from the Union as The Great Republic of Rough and Ready on April 1850 largely to avoid mining taxes but voted to rejoin the Union less than three months later on July.The Northwest Angle small exclave of Minnesota that juts north into Canada due to quirk in the definitions of the US-Canada border. Because of laws restricting fishing some residents of the Northwest Angle suggested leaving the United States and joining Canada in 1997. The following year U.S. Representative Collin Peterson of Minnesota proposed legislation to allow the residents of the Northwest Angle which is part of his district to vote on seceding from the United States and joining Canada. This action succeeded in getting fishing regulations better synchronized across these international fresh waters. State secession Some state movements seek secession from the United States itself and the formation of nation from one or more states. Alaska In November 2006 the Alaska Supreme Court held in the case Kohlhaas v. State that secession was illegal and refused to permit an initiative to be presented to the people of Alaska for vote. The Alaskan Independence Party remains factor in state politics and Walter Hickel member of the party was Governor from 1990 to 1994. California California secession known as Calexit was discussed by grassroots movement parties and small activist groups calling for the state to secede from the union in pro-secessionist meeting in Sacramento on April 15 2010. In 2015 political action committee called Yes California Independence Committee formed to advocate California 's independence from the United States. On January 2016 the California Secretary of State 's office confirmed that political body called the California National Party filed the appropriate paperwork to begin qualifying as political party. The California National Party whose primary objective is California independence ran candidate for State Assembly in the June 2016 primary. On November 2016 after Donald Trump won the presidential election residents of the state caused the hashtag calexit to trend on Twitter wanting out of the country due to his win they argue that they have the 6th largest economy in the world and more residents than any other state in the union. 32 of Californians and 44 of California Democrats were in favor of California secession in March 2017 poll. The Attorney General of California approved applications by the California Freedom Coalition and others to gather signatures to put Calexit on the 2018 ballot. In July 2018 the objectives of the Calexit initiative were expanded upon by including plan to carve out an autonomous Native American nation that would take up the eastern part of California and postponing its ballot referendum approach in favor of convincing Republican states to support their breakaway efforts. Florida The mock 1982 secessionist protest by the Conch Republic in the Florida Keys resulted in an ongoing source of local pride and tourist amusement. Georgia On April 2009 the Georgia State Senate passed resolution 43–1 that asserted the right of states to nullify federal laws under some circumstances. The resolution also asserted that if Congress the president or the federal judiciary took certain steps such as establishing martial law without state consent requiring some types of involuntary servitude taking any action regarding religion or restricting freedom of political speech or establishing further prohibitions of types or quantities of firearms or ammunition the constitution establishing the United States government would be considered nullified and the union would be dissolved. Hawaii The Hawaiian sovereignty movement has number of active groups that have won some concessions from the state of Hawaii including the offering of H.R. 258 in March 2011 which removes the words Treaty of Annexation from statute. As of 2011 it had passed committee recommendation 6–0. Montana With the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States to hear District of Columbia v. Heller in late 2007 an early 2008 movement began in Montana involving at least 60 elected officials addressing potential secession if the Second Amendment were interpreted not to grant an individual right citing its compact with the United States of America. New Hampshire On September 2012 The New Hampshire Liberty Party was formed to promote independence from the federal government and for the individual. The Free State Project is another NH based movement that has considered secession to increase liberty. On July 23 2001 founder of the FSP Jason Sorens published Announcement The Free State Project in The Libertarian Enterprise stating Even if we do n't actually secede we can force the federal government to compromise with us and grant us substantial liberties. Scotland and Quebec have both used the threat of secession to get large subsidies and concessions from their respective national governments. We could use our leverage for liberty. Oregon Following the 2016 presidential election Portland residents Christian Trejbal and Jennifer Rollins submitted petition for ballot measure relating to secession from the United States the petitioners withdrew the measure shortly afterward citing recent riots and death threats. South Carolina In May 2010 group formed that called itself the Third Palmetto Republic reference to the fact that the state claimed to be an independent republic twice before once in 1776 and again in 1860. The group models itself after the Second Vermont Republic and says its aims are for free and independent South Carolina and to abstain from any further federations. Texas The group Republic of Texas generated national publicity for its controversial actions in the late 1990s. small group still meets. In April 2009 Rick Perry the Governor of Texas raised the issue of secession in disputed comments during speech at Tea Party protest saying Texas is unique place. When we came into the union in 1845 one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that ... My hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We 've got great union. There 's absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people who knows what may come of that. Another group the Texas Nationalist Movement also seeks Texas independence from the United States but its methodology is to have the Texas Legislature call for state-wide referendum on the issue similar to the Scottish Independence vote of 2014. In 2022 the Republican Party of Texas platform called for the legislature to introduce referendum on secession. Vermont The Second Vermont Republic founded in 2003 is loose network of several groups that describes itself as nonviolent citizens network and think tank opposed to the tyranny of Corporate America and the U.S. government and committed to the peaceful return of Vermont to its status as an independent republic and more broadly the dissolution of the Union. Its primary objective is to extricate Vermont peacefully from the United States as soon as possible. They have worked closely with the Middlebury Institute created from meeting sponsored in Vermont in 2004. On October 28 2005 activists held the Vermont Independence Conference the first statewide convention on secession in the United States since North Carolina voted to secede from the Union on May 20 1861. They also participated in the 2006 and 2007 Middlebury-organized national secessionist meetings that brought delegates from over dozen groups. After Barack Obama won the 2012 presidential election secession petitions pertaining to all fifty states were filed through the White House We the People petition website. After the Supreme Court of the United States rejected Texas v. Pennsylvania Texas attempt to invalidate 2020 election results from four states Chairman of the Republican Party of Texas Allen West said Perhaps law-abiding states should bond together and form Union of states that will abide by the Constitution. Some have interpreted this as an encouragement of secession from the United States. Regional secession American Redoubt is political migration movement first proposed in 2011 which designates Idaho Montana and Wyoming along with parts of Oregon and Washington as safe haven for conservative Christians. Republic of Lakotah Some members of the Lakota people of Montana Wyoming Nebraska North Dakota and South Dakota created the Republic to assert the independence of nation that was always sovereign and did not willingly join the United States therefore they do not consider themselves technically to be secessionists. Pacific Northwest Cascadia There have been repeated attempts to form Bioregional Democracy Cascadia in the northwest. The core of Cascadia would be made up through the secession of the states of Washington Oregon and the Canadian province of British Columbia while some supporters of the movement support portions of Northern California Southern Alaska Idaho and Western Montana joining to define its boundaries along ecological cultural economic and political boundaries. League of the South The group seeks free and independent Southern republic made up of the former Confederate States of America. It operated short-lived Southern Party supporting the right of states to secede from the Union or to legally nullify federal laws. Red-State secession Blue-state secession Various editorials have proposed that states of the U.S. secede and then form federations only with states that have voted for the same political party. These editorials note the increasingly polarized political strife in the U.S. between Republican voters and Democratic voters. They propose partition of the U.S. as way of allowing both groups to achieve their policy goals while reducing the chances of civil war. Red states and blue states are states that typically vote for the Republican and Democratic parties respectively. Northwest Territorial Imperative Proposed White ethnostate in which residence or citizenship would be limited to White people and would exclude non-whites proposals for such state are advanced by White supremacists and White separatists. Historically as well as in modern times the Pacific Northwest Washington Oregon Idaho and portion of Montana has been proposed by many white supremacists as location for the establishment of White ethnostate. Aztlán Chicano nationalism Plan de Aztlan Chicano Movement Advocacy groups Brown Berets Aztlanecas Brown Berets MEChA Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlán Chicano Student Movement of Aztlán Freedom Road Socialist Organization which calls for self-determination for the Chicano nation in Aztlan up to and including the right to secession.

Republicans were somewhat more supportive than Democrats. Respondents cited issues like gridlock governmental overreach the possible unconstitutionality of the Affordable Care Act and loss of faith in the federal government as reasons for desiring secession.A 2021 poll found that 52 of Trump voters and 41 of Biden voters support partitioning the United States into multiple countries based on political party lines. different poll that same year grouped the United States into five geographic regions and found that 37 of Americans favored secession of their own region. 44 of Americans in the South favored secession with Republican support at 66 while Democratic support was 47 in the Pacific states.

Switzer 's final film role was in the 1958 drama The Defiant Ones. Besides acting Switzer bred and trained hunting dogs and guided hunting expeditions. Among his notable clients were Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Switzer 's son 's godparents James Stewart and Henry Fonda. Personal life In early 1954 Switzer went on blind date with Diantha Collingwood 1930–2004 also known as Dian or Diana. She was the daughter of Lelo and Faye Collingwood and heiress to the grain elevator empire Collingwood Grain. Collingwood had moved with her mother and sister to California in 1953 because her sister wanted to become an actress. Switzer and Collingwood got along well and married in Las Vegas three months later.In 1956 with his money running out and Diantha pregnant his mother-in-law offered them farm near Pretty Prairie Kansas. Their son Justin Lance Collingwood Switzer later Justin Lance Collingwood Elridge was born that year. They divorced in 1957. Diantha married Richard Rosswell Ross Elridge 1933–2007 who adopted and raised Lance as his own and had two other children by him sons Chris and Lee Elridge.In 1987 former Our Gang co-star George Spanky McFarland recalled meeting with Switzer when they spoke about the farm The last time saw Carl was 1957. It was tough time for me—and him. was starting tour of theme parks and county fairs in the Midwest. Carl had married this girl whose father owned pretty good size farm near Wichita. When came through town he heard about it and called. He told me he was helping to run the farm but he finally had to put radio on the tractor while he was out there plowing. Knowing Carl knew that was n't going to last. He may have come from Paris Illinois but he was n't farmer. We had n't seen each other since we left the 'Gang. So we had lunch. We talked about all the things you 'd expect. And then never saw him again. He looked pretty much the same. He was just Carl Switzer—kind of cocky little antsy—and thought to myself he had n't changed that much. He still talked big. He just grew up. In January 1958 Switzer was getting into his car in front of bar in Studio City when bullet smashed through the window and struck him in the upper right arm. The gunman was never caught. Later that December Switzer was arrested in Sequoia National Forest for cutting down 15 pine trees he had intended to illegally sell as Christmas trees. He was sentenced to one year 's probation. Switzer was ordered to pay 225 fine more than 2,100 today. Death In the midst of his legal and financial woes Switzer agreed to train hunting dog Treeing Walker Coonhound for Moses Samuel Bud Stiltz. Stiltz was longtime friend and sometime business partner whom Switzer had met while working with Roy Rogers on various productions at the Corriganville Movie Ranch. While in Switzer 's possession the dog ran off to chase after bear. Stiltz was unsympathetic towards Switzer firm in his demands that the former child star must either return his dog or pay him the equivalent of the dog 's value. Unable to produce cash to settle the debt Switzer took out ads in newspapers and put up fliers offering reward for the safe return of the animal. Eventually the dog was located and brought to the bar where Switzer was working at the time. The rescuer was rewarded with 35 in cash and 15 in alcoholic beverages the equivalent of about 450 in 2020. The loss of his 50 did not sit well with Switzer. During an emotional conversation with his friend Jack Piott 37-year-old unit still photographer that took place few days later the two decided that Stiltz should reimburse Switzer the finder 's fee. Their argument was that the dog was Stiltz 's and not Switzer 's. The two arrived at Stiltz 's home in Mission Hills at 10400 Columbus Avenue. Stiltz shared the home with his wife Rita Corrigan and his stepchildren. Switzer and Piott intended to demand money from Stiltz. Though differing accounts of the event exist all agree that Stiltz was struck over the left side of his head with glass clock. He later retreated to his room to retrieve .38-caliber revolver which Switzer wrestled him for. Their struggle caused the gun to discharge and almost shoot Tom Corrigan Stiltz 's 14-year-old stepson. Stiltz 's account of the event was one of self-defense testifying that Switzer had banged on his front door yelling Let me in or 'll kick in the door. The threat was followed by struggle that began with one of the men Switzer or Piott striking Stiltz with the clock. This prompted Stiltz to retrieve his firearm which Switzer grabbed for. The gun discharged accidentally almost shooting Corrigan. Switzer then according to Stiltz threatened him with knife and yelled 'm going to kill you. Stiltz fired and shot Switzer in the groin damaging an artery that caused massive internal bleeding. Switzer was dead when he arrived at the hospital.Tom Corrigan 's account differed significantly from his stepfather 's. He told investigators that Stiltz shot Switzer as he and Piott were leaving. After the gun 's accidental discharge that almost hit Corrigan Switzer turned to Piott and said they needed to leave. The two were headed for the door when Stiltz then fired the fatal shot. Switzer never drew knife as Stiltz had claimed he had.Corrigan was never called to testify at the coroner 's inquest and Stiltz testified in his own favor. His testimony was taken to be truthful despite physical evidence that contradicted his account and his past perjury conviction. Years later Corrigan stood by what he told officers had happened that night and said his stepfather did not have to kill Switzer. Later account The shooting was judged to be self-defense. During the inquest regarding Switzer 's death it was revealed that what was reported as hunting knife was in fact penknife. It had been found by crime scene investigators under his body. Over 42 years later in January 2001 third witness came forward and gave his version. Tom Corrigan the son of Western movie star Ray Crash Corrigan and stepson of Moses Stiltz was child who was present the night Switzer was killed. It was more like murder Corrigan told reporters. He said he heard the knock on the front door and Switzer said Western Union for Bud Stiltz. Corrigan 's mother Rita Corrigan opened the door to find drunk Switzer complaining about perceived month-old debt and demanding repayment. Corrigan said Switzer entered the house first followed by Jack Piott. Switzer said he was going to beat up Stiltz and Stiltz confronted Switzer with .38-caliber revolver in his hand. Corrigan said that Switzer grabbed the revolver and Stiltz and Switzer struggled over it. He said Piott broke glass-domed clock over Stiltz 's head causing Stiltz 's eye to swell shut. During the struggle shot was fired into the ceiling and Corrigan was struck in the leg by fragment. Corrigan said his two younger sisters ran to neighbor 's house to call for help. Well we shot Tommy enough of this he said he recalled Switzer saying just before Switzer and Piott started to leave the house. Corrigan said he had just stepped out the front door when he heard but did not witness second shot behind him. He said he then turned and saw Switzer sliding down the wall with surprised look on his face after Stiltz had shot him. Corrigan said he saw closed penknife at Switzer 's side which he presumed fell out of his pocket or his hand. He said he then saw his stepfather shove Piott against the kitchen counter and threaten to kill him too. Corrigan said they heard emergency sirens as Piott begged for his life and that he thought this was the only reason Stiltz did not kill Piott. Corrigan said his stepfather lied in his account of the event before the coroner 's jury.Corrigan said Los Angeles Police Department detective interviewed him and asked if he would testify before the judge. Corrigan said he agreed to but he was never called before the court. He did n't have to kill him Corrigan said decades later.Moses Stiltz died in 1983 at the age of 62. Burial Carl Switzer was interred at the Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood California. Because he died the same day as Cecil B. DeMille his death received only minor notice in most newspapers as DeMille 's obituary dominated the columns. Switzer had appeared as slave uncredited in the last film for which DeMille was credited as director The Ten Commandments.Switzer 's gravestone features the square and compasses of Freemasonry and an image of hunting dog reflecting his dog-training hunting-guide interests at the time of his death.

During his tenure as governor in years of the Great Depression he established record for the number of times he used the National Guard to perform duties in the state and for declaring martial law at time of unrest. Early life and education William Henry Davis Murray was born on November 21 1869 in the town of Toadsuck Texas renamed Collinsville in the 1880s. He was born to Uriah Dow Thomas Murray farmer and Bertha Elizabeth Jones. His mother died when he was two years old. His father remarried and moved the family to Montague Texas. At the age of twelve Murray left home.During most of Murray 's adolescence he worked on farms during the summer and attended public schools in the winter. Murray worked and studied hard and was admitted to the College Hill Institute in Springtown Texas. He graduated from College Hill with teaching degree in 1889 and began teaching in public school in Parker County Texas.Murray became politically active and joined the Farmers Alliance and the Democratic Party. He was skilled orator and campaigned for James Stephen Hogg when the latter ran for Governor of Texas. Early career Murray moved to Corsicana Texas where he founded newspaper that survived for two years. During this time he ran for the state senate but failed both attempts. He moved to Fort Worth Texas where he worked as writer for the Fort Worth Gazette. While at College Hill Murray had taken an interest in law and read the law in Fort Worth. He passed the Texas bar exam in 1897 and first practiced law in Fort Worth Texas. Indian Territory In 1898 Murray moved to Tishomingo the capital of the Chickasaw Nation in the Indian Territory now eastern Oklahoma where he started law practice. Murray 's legal knowledge and colorful personality brought him to the attention of Douglas H. Johnston the Governor of the Chickasaw Nation who appointed him as legal advisor. year later Murray married Johnston 's niece Mary Alice Hearrell see below. In addition to practicing law in Tishomingo Murray began to learn farming and ranching. He acquired his nickname Alfalfa around 1902 while working as political operative for Palmer S. Moseley gubernatorial candidate for the Oklahoma Territory. Murray frequently toured to give talks to local farmers about politics and farming. He often referred to large tract of alfalfa which he cultivated. Arthur Sinclair who heard one of his speeches reported to the editor of the Tishomingo Capital-Democrat that he had just seen Alfalfa Bill deliver one of his finest speeches. The name stuck with Murray for the rest of his life. Marriage and family On July 19 1899 Murray married Mary Alice Hearrell niece of Chickasaw Governor Douglas H. Johnston. They had five children together. Their son Johnston Murray born in 1902 followed his father into politics and was elected as Governor of Oklahoma in 1950 serving 1951-1955. States of Sequoyah and Oklahoma Murray 's relationship with the Chickasaw governor Johnston benefited his political career. By 1903 American Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes were talking of seeking statehood for Indian Territory as an independent Indian-controlled state to be called the State of Sequoyah. In 1905 the tribes organized convention to draw up state constitution. Governor Johnston appointed Murray to represent the Chickasaw at the convention in Muskogee. Of the six delegates at the convention four were Native Americans Murray and Charles N. Haskell were the only non-tribal European Americans. The delegates drafted constitution which in referendum was overwhelmingly approved by the voters of the Five Tribes. Trying to avoid another state that might be dominated by Democrats because of the Five Civilized Tribes origin in the Southeast and their histories of slave-holding and alliance with the Confederacy in the Civil War President Theodore Roosevelt Republican opposed separate statehood for Sequoyah. Roosevelt insisted that the Indian and Oklahoma territories had to be admitted as one state Oklahoma. In response to Congress 's passage of the Enabling Act in 1906 the people of the two territories held joint convention. Murray was elected as the delegate for District 104 which included Tishomingo. At the convention in Guthrie Murray worked closely with Robert L. Williams and again with Charles N. Haskell. They became lifelong friends and political allies. Due to his experience in Chickasaw politics Murray was elected by the delegates in 1906 as the President of the constitutional Convention. He kept Haskell close to him one newspaper reported the latter was the power behind the throne. Together the two men controlled the convention gradually shifting power away from the president and vice-president of the convention Pleasant Porter Creek and Green McCurtain Choctaw. The Oklahoma Constitution produced under their guidance was substantially based on elements of the Sequoyah constitution. The proposed constitution included white-supremacist and segregationist clauses strongly supported by Murray. President Roosevelt objected to these clauses and obtained their deletion before the constitution was submitted to Congress. The US Congress admitted Oklahoma to the Union as the 46th state on November 16 1907. Oklahoma politics With the state constitution in place elections were held in 1907 for offices of the new state government. Murray was elected as state representative and after being admitted to office as the first Speaker of the Oklahoma House of Representatives. His ally Charles Haskell was elected as the state 's first governor. As speaker Murray often opposed the progressive work of Kate Barnard Commissioner of Charities and Corrections and he pushed for Jim Crow laws similar to those in southern states to control blacks We should adopt provision prohibiting the mixed marriages of negroes with other races in this State and provide for separate schools and give the Legislature power to separate them in waiting rooms and on passenger coaches and all other institutions in the State ... As rule they are failures as lawyers doctors and in other professions ... appreciate the old-time ex-slave the old darky and they are the salt of their race who comes to me talking softly in that humble spirit which should characterize their actions and dealings with the white man. Murray left the state legislature after one term and did not seek re-election in 1908. In 1910 Murray ran for governor but lost in the Democratic primary. In 1912 Murray was elected as U.S. Representative from one of Oklahoma 's three at-large seats. Oklahoma had gained three seats in the 1910 Congressional apportionment but had not drawn up new district map. In 1914 he was elected to second term from Oklahoma 's 4th congressional district under the new map. In 1916 he was defeated for renomination as the Democratic candidate for this district. In 1918 Murray again ran for governor and lost in the Democratic primary. He retired from politics and returned to private law practice in Tishomingo. In 1924 Murray led group of Oklahoma ranchers who formed private colony in southeastern Bolivia. His son Johnston Murray joined him in this effort. He and his son stayed in Bolivia until 1929 when both returned to Oklahoma. Murray began campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor in 1930. Governor of Oklahoma Murray won the Democratic nomination and won the general election by almost 100,000 votes the largest majority of any Oklahoma governor up to that time. His campaign slogan at time of the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl railed against The Three 's Corporations Carpetbaggers and Coons. Murray was inaugurated as the ninth Governor of Oklahoma on January 12 1931. He faced the harsh problems of the Great Depression. Under the previous Governor William J. Holloway the state government had accumulated deficit of over 5,000,000 in its effort to encourage jobs and provide welfare. Mass unemployment mortgage foreclosures the deficit and bank failures haunted Murray 's administration. In 1931 the legislature appropriated 600,000 for emergency necessities. Through money collected from state employees businessmen and his own salary Murray financed programs to feed Oklahoma 's poor. No federal relief program had yet been instituted. Murray became national leader for the victims of the Depression and called for national council for relief to be held at Memphis Tennessee in June 1931. During Alfalfa Bill Murray 's campaign for governor he promised to crack down on corruption and favoritism for the rich to abolish half the clerk jobs at the State House to appoint no family members to reduce the number of state-owned cars from 800 to 200 never to use convict labor to compete with commercial labor and not to abuse the power of pardon. Once in office he appointed wealthy patrons and 20 of his relatives to high office purchased more cars used prisoners to make ice for sale and clean the capitol building and violated all the other promises. When the State Auditor pointed out that 1,050 new employees had been added to the state payroll Murray simply said Just damned lies. For each abuse of power Murray claimed mandate from the sovereign will of the people .The government of Oklahoma faced failure not only because of the massive deficit but because many of Oklahoma 's citizens could not pay their debts. To speed the collection of funds at Murray 's urging the Legislature created the Oklahoma Tax Commission. This three-member commission was responsible for the collection and administration of taxes licenses and fees from all citizens. The new agency established safeguards against tax evasion and helped to stem the drain on the state 's tax revenue. Due to the severity of the depression Murray relied on the Oklahoma National Guard to enforce the state 's laws through the use of martial law. Murray did this in spite of impeachment threats from the Oklahoma Senate. During his tenure as governor Murray called out the Guard and charged them with duties ranging from policing ticket sales at University of Oklahoma football games to patrolling the oil fields. Murray also used the Guard during the Toll Bridge War between Oklahoma and Texas. joint project to build free bridge across the Red River on U.S. Highway 75 between Durant Oklahoma and Denison Texas turned into major dispute when the Governor of Texas blocked traffic from entering his state on the new bridge. The Red River Bridge Company of Texas owned the original toll bridge and had dispute over its purchase deal. Murray sent the Guard to reopen the bridge in July 1931. Texas had to retreat when lawyers determined that Oklahoma had jurisdiction over both banks of the river. Murray used the Guard to reduce oil production in the hopes of raising prices. Because of the vast quantity of newly opened wells in Texas and Oklahoma oil prices had sunk below the costs of production. Murray and three other governors met in Fort Worth Texas to demand lower production. When the Oklahoma producers did not comply on August 1931 Murray called out the Guard declared martial law and ordered that some 3,000 oil wells be shut down. By the end of his administration in 1935 Murray had used the National Guard on 47 occasions and declared martial law more than 30 times. As the state constitution prevented governors from succeeding themselves in office Murray could not run for reelection and left office on January 15 1935. In 1933 Murray 's longtime friend Charles Haskell died. Murray was very affected by this loss. In 1932 Murray sought the Democratic nomination for President and ran in several primaries but he did not win any. He received nearly 20 percent of the vote in Oregon. Huey Pierce Long Jr. the former governor of Louisiana and U.S. senator recalled visiting Murray in his hotel room at the 1932 Democratic National Convention in Chicago Alfalfa Bill was very gracious .... While we talked at length he dwelt upon the virtue in the possible candidacies of everybody except Franklin Roosevelt and himself even suggesting me as candidate. He understood the favorite son game. soon saw that was fencing with past master in politics. Had listened to him very long he would have been at work to make favorite son candidate out of me. was then moving Heaven and earth to keep down other favorite son candidates. .... Favorite son moves were the most dangerous things we had to fight. ... Murray initially supported President Franklin Roosevelt but he later turned against the New Deal as did other conservative Oklahoma politicians of that time. Later life and death In 1938 Murray ran for governor and lost in the Democratic primary. Later that year he tried to run for the United States Senate as an Independent but his nominating petitions were filed late. In 1942 he ran for the Senate again and lost in the Democratic primary. His wife Mary Alice died in Oklahoma City on August 28 1938. Her body lay in state in the Oklahoma Capitol on the afternoon of August 29 1938 she was the first woman to receive the honor. She was buried in Tishomingo the following day.After his retirement Murray became widely known for his radical racist and conspiracy views. He wrote articles and books dealing with constitutional rights. In his books Murray seemed to indicate his support for fascism. Murray supported Strom Thurmond 's insurgent Dixiecrat bid for the presidency against Harry S. Truman and Thomas E. Dewey in 1948. Murray 's son Johnston Murray had followed his father into Democratic Party politics. The senior Murray administered the oath of office to his son in 1951 after he was elected as the state 's fourteenth governor. Murray did not live long past his son 's governorship. He died on October 15 1956 of stroke and pneumonia. He is buried in Tishomingo. Murray was considered the last surviving member of the Haskell Dynasty.
